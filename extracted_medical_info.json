how are you doing with ... i know you were making some diet changes .\n[patient] yeah , i've been pretty good with the diet , but with the pain i have been having, it has been easier to call and have something delivered. so i have been ordering a lot of take-out and fast food that can be delivered to my door so i don't have to go out and up and down the steps to get it myself. but other than that , it's been pretty good .\n[doctor] okay . are you staying hydrated ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . all right . okay , well , let's go ahead and , uh , i know the nurse did a review of systems , you know , with you , and i know that you're endorsing some back pain and a little bit of dizziness , um , and some blood in your urine . any other symptoms ? you know , muscle aches , chest pain ... uh , body aches , anything like that ?\n[patient] i have some body aches because i think i'm ... i'm favoring , um , my back when i'm walking because of the pain , like i kinda feel it in my muscles , but not out of the ordinary and not surprised 'cause i remember that from two years ago .\n[doctor] okay . all right . well , let's go ahead and ... and look at your vital signs today . hey , dragon ? show me the blood pressure . yeah , so your blood pressure's a little high today . that's probably because you're in some pain , um , but let ... let me just take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] okay , so on ... on physical exam , you do have some , uh , cda tenderness on the right-hand side , meaning that you're tender when i ... when i pound on that .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] um , and your abdomen also feels a little tender . you have some tenderness of the palpation of the right lower quadrant , but other than that , your heart sounds nice and clear and your lungs are clear as well . so let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results , okay ?\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the creatinine . so we ... we drew a creatinine when you came in here because i was concerned about the kidney stones . it ... it is uh ... it is up slightly , which might suggest that you have a little bit of a obstruction there of one-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . of the stones . okay ? hey , dragon . show me the abdominal x-rays . okay , and there might be a question of a ... uh , of a stone there lower down , uh , but we'll wait for the official read there . so the , uh , abdominal x-rays show a possible kidney stone , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you . so , for your first problem , your back pain , i think you're having a recurrence of your kidney stones . so i wan na go ahead and order a ct scan without contrast of your abdomen and pelvis . okay ?\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] and i'm also gon na order you some ultram 50 milligrams as needed every six hours for pain . does that sound okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] hey , dragon ?
