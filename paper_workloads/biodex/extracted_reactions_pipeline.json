However, the clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors remains limited owing to the patients' immunological status, such as the number of lymphocytes, programmed death ligand 1 expression, and tumor mutation burden. In this study, we successfully treated two patients with advanced esophageal cancer who responded to the combination of adoptive immune cell therapy and a low-dose immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo Asian (Japanese) patients with advanced esophageal cancer who were resistant to conventional chemoradiation therapy were referred to our hospital for immune therapy. Case\u00a01 was a 66-year-old woman who was diagnosed as having esophageal cancer. She received concurrent chemoradiation therapy and then underwent subtotal esophagectomy, after which she became cancer free. However, she relapsed, and cancer cells were found in the lung and lymph nodes 6\u00a0months later. She enrolled in a clinical trial at our institution (clinical trial number UMIN000028756). She received adoptive immune cell therapy twice at a 2-week interval followed by low-dose nivolumab with adoptive immune cell therapy four times at 2-week intervals. A follow-up computed tomography scan showed partial response, with mass reduction of the metastatic lung and mediastinal lesions. Case\u00a02 was a 77-year-old man. He received concurrent chemoradiation therapy with fluoropyrimidine/platinum, and gastroscopy revealed complete remission of esophageal cancer. He was disease free for 5\u00a0months, but routine computed tomography revealed multiple metastases in his lungs and lymph nodes. He visited our clinic to receive adoptive immune cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy. Radiographic evidence showed continuous improvement of lesions. There was no evidence of severe adverse events during the combination therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe combination of adoptive immune cell therapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor might be a possible treatment strategy for advanced esophageal cancer. Trial registration UMIN000028756. Registered 14 September 2017.\n\nTEXT:\nBackground\n\nEsophageal cancer is an aggressive malignancy and the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. Although treatment strategies such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy have been developed in recent years, the prognosis for patients with recurrent or advanced-stage esophageal cancer remains poor [2]. The limited improvement in treatment outcome obtained by conventional therapies has prompted the search for innovative strategies for the treatment of this cancer, especially molecular or immune-targeting treatments.\n\nThe programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway serves as a checkpoint to limit T-cell-mediated immune responses. Two ligands, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PDL-L2), engage the PD-1 receptor and induce PD-1 signaling and associated T-cell exhaustion, resulting in reversible inhibition of T-cell activation and proliferation [3]. Tumor cells can co-opt the PD-1 pathway to evade immune responses by expressing PD-L1 on the cell surface and engaging PD-1 receptor-positive immune effector cells [4]. Thus, PD-1 and PD-L1 have attracted considerable attention for their roles in tumor immunology and as immune-based therapeutic targets [3, 5]. A number of clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 signal-blockade agents as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently demonstrated dramatic antitumor efficacy in patients with numerous types of malignancy, including esophageal cancer [6, 7].\n\nAlthough PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues prior to treatment correlates with clinical outcomes, the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the invaded margin of the tumor may better predict the response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy [8]. Recent research has shown four different types of tumor microenvironment based on the presence or absence of TILs and PD-L1 expression [9]. Tumors that are both PD-L1 and TIL positive are most likely to benefit from single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade because such tumors possess preexisting TILs that are turned off by PD-L1 engagement. Thus, better understanding of PD-L1 expression and TIL status in esophageal cancer tissues may have considerable clinical implications.\n\nAdoptive T-cell therapy using TILs has been found to mediate durable, complete cancer regression in patients with melanoma and epithelial cancers [10\u201312]. Collectively, these responses were likely based on the recognition of unique, patient-specific mutated neoantigens through the T-cell receptor (TCR) [12]. However, isolation of TILs from cancer tissue is not always feasible. It was recently demonstrated that peripheral blood lymphocytes contained TIL-like cells recognizing tumor-specific antigens and could be a source of noninvasive options for immune cell therapy [13]. Previously, we and others reported that adoptive T-cell therapy using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (adoptive cell therapy, ACT), which are activated and proliferated through a culture process involving stimulation with an immobilized anti-CD-3 antibody and interleukin-2 (IL-2), has shown certain efficacy against various cancers without severe adverse events [14, 15], indicating that the efficacy of ACT might partially be derived from TILs associated with peripheral blood cells.\n\nAlthough ICIs have great potential for cancer immunotherapy, their efficacy is still limited by some toxicities. Synergies between ICI therapy and other immunotherapies including cancer vaccines or ACT are currently being investigated in several clinical trials [15]. Here, we report the cases of two patients with advanced esophageal cancer who were successfully treated and responded to the combination of ACT and an ICI, nivolumab, suggesting that this combination might be a possible treatment strategy for advanced esophageal cancer.\n\nCase presentation\n\nCase 1\n\nA female Asian (Japanese) patient was diagnosed as having esophageal cancer in February 2016 at 66\u00a0years of age. Biopsy and computed tomography (CT) revealed squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus at clinical stage\u00a0IV (UICC, T4N2M0). She received concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) with fluoropyrimidine/platinum from March to April 2016, then underwent subtotal esophagectomy in June 2016. Histopathological analysis of surgical tumor specimens revealed that her esophageal cancer was at clinical stage II (UICC, T3N0M0). She remained disease free until November 2016, when routine CT revealed a new pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymph node swelling, 2.0\u00a0cm in diameter, in her left lung. She visited our clinic to receive ACT in December 2016 after radiotherapy for the lymph node metastasis in her lung from January to February 2017. During radiotherapy, she also received ACT using \u03b1\u03b2T lymphocytes four times at 2\u20133-week intervals until April 2017. Then chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine/platinum/docetaxel was administered until January 2018. However, routine CT revealed multiple lung metastases in February 2018. In July 2018, she enrolled in a clinical trial at our institution (clinical trial number UMIN000028756) (Fig. 1a). Before starting the clinical trial, we evaluated PD-L1 expression level using her tumor specimens and found that the PD-L1 expression level in the tumor tissue was less than 1%. The tumor was negative for microsatellite instability (MSI; data not shown). She received ACT twice at a 2-week interval, followed by nivolumab at a dose of 0.3\u00a0mg/kg body weight with ACT four times at 2-week intervals, as part of induction therapy. A follow-up CT scan on 19 September 2018 (9 weeks after nivolumab initiation) showed partial response, with 48% mass reduction of the lung metastases and mediastinal lesion (Fig. 1b). She was allowed to continue with nivolumab treatment at a dose of 40\u00a0mg/kg body weight as maintenance therapy at 3-week intervals. Over her clinical course in 2018, there was radiographic evidence of slight improvement (Fig. 1c), and maintenance nivolumab therapy was continued because the patient was clinically well and alive. Mild, asymptomatic hypothyroidism developed, which required thyroid hormone supplementation, but she showed no other clinically significant treatment-related toxicity.Fig. 1 Clinical course of case 1.

CT and biopsy of specimens revealed squamous carcinoma of the esophagus at clinical stage\u00a0IV (UICC, T4N2M1). He received CCRT with fluoropyrimidine/platinum from July to November 2017. In December 2017, gastroscopy revealed complete remission of esophageal cancer. He remained disease free until April 2018, when routine CT revealed multiple metastases in his bilateral lungs and lymph nodes of the right hilum (Fig. 2a). He was administered docetaxel as second-line chemotherapy from May to September 2018, but his lung metastases were found to have progressed (Fig. 2b). He visited our clinic to receive ACT in October 2018, followed by ACT using \u03b1\u03b2T lymphocytes three times at 2\u20133-week intervals until December 2018. He then received dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with MUC1, MAGE3, and survivin, which were expressed on his tumor cells as tumor antigens, 12 times at 2\u20133-week intervals from 26 December 2018 to 28 June 2019 (Fig. 2). During ACT and pulsed DC therapy, he developed brain metastasis in November 2018 and underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastasis. Routine CT revealed that the sizes of multiple lung and lymph node metastatic lesions were reduced, which were evaluated as partial response on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in January 2019 (Fig.\u00a02c). Furthermore, the sizes of brain metastatic lesions were decreased in April 2019. In September 2019, follow-up CT revealed regrowth of metastatic lesions in the lung and hilar lymph nodes, and he started to receive ACT once a month (Fig.\u00a02d). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the PD-L1 expression level in the tumor was 1%, and the tumor was negative for MSI (data not shown). Following ACT, he received nivolumab at a dose of 0.6\u00a0mg/kg body weight four times at 2-week intervals as part of induction therapy. A follow-up CT scan on 27 November 2019 (8\u00a0weeks after nivolumab initiation) showed partial response, with 60% reduction of the lung mass and hilar lymph node swelling (Fig. 2e). He was allowed to continue with nivolumab treatment at a dose of 40\u00a0mg/kg body weight as maintenance therapy at 3-week intervals. Over his clinical course in 2019, radiographic evidence showed continuous improvement of lesions, and his treatment was continued with maintenance nivolumab therapy (Fig.\u00a02f) because the patient was clinically well and alive. There was no evidence of adverse events during combination therapy.Fig. 2 Clinical course of case 2. Axial CT images corresponding to the timelines of therapy and disease status.

Responses were durable during maintenance therapy with the ICI (f). Narrow black arrows, bold black arrows, and red arrows indicate ACT, DC vaccine, and nivolumab administration, respectively (bottom)\n\nFlow cytometric analysis of patients\u2019 peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after combination immunotherapy with ACT and ICI\n\nThe total number of cells used for ACT ranged from 7.3 to 10.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 (average 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 cells/infusion) in case 1 and from 3.9 to 7.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 (average 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 cells/infusion) in case 2, and the characteristics of \u03b1\u03b2T cells prepared from each patient were not significantly changed at the first and fourth cultivation (data not shown). The numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) and CD45+ leukocytes in peripheral blood did not change after ICI and ACT combination immunotherapy (Fig. 3). The numbers of CD3+, TCR\u03b1\u03b2+, TCR\u03b3\u03b4T+, CD4+CD8\u2212T, and CD4\u2212CD8+T cells were significantly lower than those in healthy subjects before ACT [16], and increased after ICI and ACT combination immunotherapy (Fig. 3). There were no significant differences in the numbers of CD3\u2212CD56+, IFN-\u03b3+IL4\u2212 (Th1), IFN-\u03b3-IL4+ (Th2), and Foxp3+ (Treg) cells among the CD3+CD4+ subset cells (Fig.\u00a03).Fig. 3 Flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and 2\u00a0weeks after combination therapy with ICI and ACT. The phenotype of PBMCs was analyzed as described in \u201cPatients and methods.\u201d The phenotype and mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (shaded box) in healthy subjects are shown in each graph. The solid line indicates the number of cells in case\u00a01, and the dotted line indicates that in case\u00a02\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n\nWe describe herein two cases of patients treated with the combination of ACT and an ICI; one patient was treated concurrently with ACT and an ICI, and the other patient obtained a partial response by administration of ACT and a DC vaccine followed by ICI administration for recurrence.\n\nAlthough grade 1 hypothyroidism occurred in case 1 that required thyroid hormone supplementation, we observed no further severe adverse events in either case. Since we assumed that combination therapy with ACT and the ICI might increase the incidence and severity of adverse events, we used a much lower dose of nivolumab than the standard dose, that is, 0.3 or 0.6\u00a0mg/kg body weight (20 mg/kg body weight or 40 mg/kg body weight), respectively. The standard dose of nivolumab used in cancer therapy is usually 240\u00a0mg/kg body weight, so the dose administered in this trial was one-sixth or one-twelfth of the standard dose of nivolumab, for which no sufficient clinical data have been reported for evaluating the efficacy of nivolumab for esophageal cancer. However, it has been shown by in vitro analysis that even a low dose of nivolumab, 0.3 mg/kg body weight, was sufficient to inhibit PD-L1/PD-1 association [17].\n\nSeveral biomarkers that can predict the clinical response of nivolumab have been reported. PD-L1 expression is one of the candidates, since a number of gastrointestinal cancers overexpress this molecule [18, 19]. Although PD-L1 expression determined by immunohistochemical staining has been correlated with prognosis and response to ICIs in several studies [17, 18], other studies demonstrated ICI efficacy in patients deemed to be PD-L1 negative [20]. Thus, the true relationship between PD-L1 expression and clinical efficacy has not yet been elucidated. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been demonstrated to be significantly associated with PD-1 and the PD-L1 blocking response. Cancers that have a higher TMB, that is, a higher neoantigen exposure to the immune system, seem more likely to respond to ICIs [21]. In both patients reported herein, analysis of their tumor specimens showed microsatellite stability and a PDL-1 expression level of 1% or lower. TILs are also found to be an independent marker for prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival in esophageal cancer, thus indicating the critical role of T cells in tumor immunity [22]. Nevertheless, these markers do not always determine the treatment response to ICIs, suggesting that other factors, such as host immunity, might affect the clinical response to ICIs. For example, an association has been demonstrated between pretreatment lymphocyte count and response to ICIs: patients with higher baseline lymphocyte counts showed better clinical benefits from ICIs [23]. Lymphocytes in peripheral blood have been reported to include T cells targeting neoantigens derived from tumor cells [13, 24]. Thus, an adequate immune status of T cells in patients is necessary to obtain better efficacy of ICIs. Our previous studies revealed that the T cell immune status was impaired in advanced cancer patients and it was restored by ACT, suggesting the beneficial effect of combination therapy with ICIs and ACT [16, 24]. Compatible with these observations, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the numbers of CD3+T lymphocytes and their subsets, including TCR\u03b1\u03b2+, TCR\u03b3\u03b4T+, CD4+CD8\u2212T, and CD4\u2212CD8+T cells, increased after ICI and ACT combination therapy in both patients (Fig. 3), and it might lead to favorable responses to ICIs.\n\nAlthough the dose of nivolumab given to both patients was very low, it remains unclear whether clinical responses could be obtained at a much lower dose of the ICI alone or the combination of ACT and the ICI. A controlled study is necessary with a large number of patients to clarify this issue. In the case that even a very low dose of nivolumab is found to be effective, dose escalation studies may be required to reevaluate the doses of ICIs for cancer treatment.\n\nPatients and methods\n\nPatients\n\nThis study was conducted from September 2017 to March 2019. The patients were administered ACT twice at a 2\u20133-week interval followed by 0.3\u20130.6\u00a0mg/kg nivolumab and ACT four times at 2-week intervals. The institutional review board of the hospital approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients (clinical study number, UMIN000028756: an exploratory clinical trial on the safety of combination therapy with effector cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with malignant tumor).\n\nPreparation for ACT\n\nActivated lymphocytes were generated as previously described [14]. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the patients\u2019 peripheral blood using a Vacutainer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The PBMCs were activated in a culture flask with an immobilized monoclonal antibody to CD3 (Jansen-Kyowa, Tokyo, Japan) in HyMedium 930 (Kohjin Bio, Saitama, Japan) containing 1% autologous serum. The PBMCs were then cultured for 14 days with 700\u00a0IU/ml IL-2 (Proleukin\u00ae; Chiron, Amsterdam, Netherlands), after which 3\u201310\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 cells were harvested and suspended in 50\u00a0ml normal saline for intravenous injection. To prepare a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine, PBMCs were collected from the patients by leukapheresis and allowed to adhere to a plastic culture flask. The adherent cell fraction was used for DC culture for 6\u00a0days in a medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml IL-4 (Primmune Corp., Osaka, Japan) and 50 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Primmune Corp.) to generate immature DCs. The DCs were pulsed with antigenic tumor-specific peptides or an autologous tumor lysate and allowed to mature for 24\u00a0h. After the culture, 1\u201310\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 mature DCs were harvested and suspended in 1\u00a0ml normal saline for subcutaneous injection, then cryopreserved until the day of administration.\n\nFlow cytometry of PBMCs\n\nHeparinized whole blood was collected from the patients. The phenotype of PBMCs was analyzed by whole-blood staining with OptiLyse C lysis solution [16]. Absolute cell number was determined using Flow-Count\u2122 fluorospheres as internal standard beads. OptiLyse C, Flow-Count beads, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD45, CD56, TCR pan \u03b1\u03b2, TCR pan \u03b3\u03b4, and TCR V\u03b39 were purchased from Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA, USA). Lymphoprep\u2122 (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) was used with gradient centrifugation to isolate the PBMCs. For Foxp3 staining, the PBMCs were fixed and permeabilized using a fixation/permeabilization kit (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, and Foxp3 was stained with anti-Foxp3 mAb (clone 259D, BioLegend). For intracellular cytokine production assay, the PBMCs were suspended in a conditioned medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 4\u00a0h for the IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 assay. After the activated cells were fixed and permeabilized, intracellular cytokines were stained with an anti-IFN- \u03b3 or anti-IL-4 (Beckman Coulter) antibody. A Cytomics FC500 or a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) was used for data acquisition, and the data were analyzed using CXP or Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nTo measure the PD-L1 expression level in cancer tissue, PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nMicrosatellite instability\n\nMicrosatellite instability (MSI) was determined using a modified version of the pentaplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay as described by Buhard et al. [25] using five markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24, and MONO-27) and analyzed using an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nPD-1 Programmed death 1\n\nICI Immune checkpoint inhibitor\n\nACT Adoptive immune cell therapy\n\nPD-L1 and PD-L2 Programmed death ligand-1 and programmed death ligand-2, respectively\n\nTIL Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte\n\nTCL T-cell receptor\n\nIL-2 Interleukin-2\n\nPBMC Peripheral blood mononuclear cell\n\nDC Dendritic cell\n\nGM-CSF Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor\n\nMSI Microsatellite instability\n\nCT Computed tomography\n\nCCRT Concurrent chemoradiation therapy\n\nDTX Docetaxel\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nNot applicable.\n\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\n\nRT, TK, TG, TT, and SG treated the patients and made the clinical diagnosis.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nAtypical metastatic lung cancer of the right ventricle on FDG PET/CT.\n\nABSTRACT:\nAlthough primary cardiac tumours are extremely uncommon, secondary tumours or cardiac metastasis are not. We present a 68-year-old gentleman with squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe with bony metastasis to the right clavicle who was treated with radiotherapy to the lung and clavicle as well as combination immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel). Despite completing the above treatment regime, 18F-FDG PET/CT scan showed progression with two new sites of metastasis including a focus in the lateral wall of the right ventricle which correlate to a soft tissue density mass on CT as well as a FDG avid mass in the left masseter. Identification of cardiac lesions with 18F-FDG PET/CT maybe challenging with routine preparation due high physiological FDG uptake in the myocardium and significant variability, nevertheless, focal FDG uptake in the heart should be carefully assessed for the possibility of cardiac metastasis.\n\nTEXT:\npmcBackground\n\nAlthough primary cardiac tumours are extremely uncommon, secondary tumours or cardiac metastasis are not. In theory, any malignant cancer with metastatic potential can spread to the heart and the incidence of cardiac metastasis seems to be not as low as expected, with reported incidence of 1.5%-20% of autopsies of cancer patients.[1] Primary lung cancer represents about one third of cardiac metastasis followed by breast cancer and haematologic malignancies.[2], [3], [4] 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) is well established as an important imaging modality in oncology for tumor staging, restaging, detection of recurrence, and monitoring treatment response. However, due to high physiological FDG uptake in the myocardium and significant inter-and intra-individual variability, focal cardiac uptake not confined to normal pattern can be a real challenge for interpretation. Although there is existing literature on cardiac metastasis from uterine cervical carcinoma[5], vesical carcinoma[6], renal cell carcinoma[7] and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue[8], there is few literature on cardiac metastasis from lung cancer[9,10], in particular squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 68-year-old gentleman with a background medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and osteoporosis presented to his general practitioner with one month history of right shoulder pain. He is an ex-smoker and has an approximately 30 pack year smoking history. He also have previous asbestos exposure from truck brake linings. A subsequent X-ray of his shoulder revealed a distal right clavicle lesion (Fig.\u00a01, white arrow) and a mass lesion of the right lung (Fig.\u00a01, black arrow). He denied any shortness of breath, cough or haemoptysis prior to presentation. On examination, there was no focal tenderness of the right clavicle and his chest was clear to auscultation. A subsequent computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a right lower lobe pulmonary mass measuring approximately 50 mm with invasion into the adjacent pleura. This was associated with a right perihilar speculated lesion with infiltration of the right upper pulmonary arteries and veins and associated right lower and upper paratracheal lymphadenopathy consistent with primary lung malignancy with ipsilateral lung and nodal metastasis. There was also CT evidence consistent with asbestos related pleural disease.Fig. 1 X-ray of the right shoulder of a 68-year-old man who was referred with right shoulder pain revealed presence of a right lung mass (white arrow) with bulky pulmonary hilum associated with a destructive lesion in the distal right clavicle (white arrow)\n\nFig 1\n\nEndobronchial ultrasound and biopsy of right lower paratracheal lymph node as well as the right clavicle were performed confirming the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. 18F- FDG PET/CT scan was performed for further evaluation which showed FDG-avid lesions in the right lower lobe with central photopenia suggestive of necrosis (SUVmax 9.7) (Fig.\u00a02, block arrows) and right hilar lesion (SUVmax 10.2) (Fig.\u00a02, thin arrows) with FDG avid metastasis to upper and lower paratracheal lymph nodes (SUVmax 6.4) as well as the right lateral clavicle corresponding to a destructive soft tissue lesion (SUVmax 17.1) (Fig.\u00a02, curved arrows). He was started on chemotherapy (Carboplatin and Paclitaxel) with immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab) in addition to high dose radiotherapy to the right lung as well as the clavicle following discussion at a Lung Multidisciplinary Team Meeting.Fig. 2 Patient was referred for 18F- FDG PET/CT scan for staging of squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe. Maximal Intensity Projection (A), axial CT (B, D and F) and PET (C, E and G) images demonstrated FDG-avid lesion in the right lower lobe (block arrows) associated with a speculated perihilar mass (thin arrows) and metastatic spread to paratracheal lymph nodes and the right clavicle corresponding to a lytic lesion on CT (curved arrows).\n\nFig 2\n\nAfter completing four cycles of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, a repeat PET/CT scan was performed which demonstrated that the previously treated right lower lobe mass as well as the right upper lobe masses have decreased in size, however the right lower lobe mass had significantly increased in FDG avidity (SUVmax 53 compared to 9.7) (Fig.\u00a03, thin arrows). There was also anatomical and metabolic progression of the right clavicular lesion (Fig.\u00a03, curved arrows). There was also interval increase in size and avidity in the right upper and lower paratracheal lymph nodes. Two new FDG avid disease were also discovered including the lateral wall of the right ventricle corresponding to a low density lesion on CT (SUVmax 16.1) (Fig.\u00a03, black block arrows) and the left masseter muscle (SUVmax 28.0) (Fig.\u00a03, white block arrows).Fig. 3 Maximal Intensity Projection (A) and axial CT (B, D and F) and PET (C, E and G) images of repeat FDG-PET/CT nine months later following treatment with radiotherapy to the lung and clavicle as well as combination immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel) showed increase in FDG avidity in the known pulmonary mass, paratracheal lymph nodes and right clavicle; two new FDG avid sites of metastasis were discovered including the lateral wall of the right ventricle (SUVmax 16.1) represented by black block arrows and the left masseter muscle region (SUVmax 28.0) represented by white block arrow.\n\nFig 3\n\nHe received radiotherapy to the left masseter muscle and was placed on clinical trial treatment for targeted therapy. However, further disease progression was demonstrated on follow up imaging with new metastasis to the right 7-9 ribs and right femur. The right ventricular mass lesion had progressed in size and extent, seen to cause extrinsic compression of the right ventricular cavity as demonstrated on CT scan 6 months following the repeat FDG-PET/CT (Fig.\u00a04, block arrows).Fig. 4 Axial diagnostic CT image 6 months following the repeat FDG-PET/CT study shows progression of the right ventricular lesion (block arrows) causing extrinsic compression of the right ventricular cavity and enlargement of the pulmonary mass.\n\nFig 4\n\nDiscussion\n\nPrimary cardiac tumors are extremely uncommon whereas secondary cardiac tumors or cardiac metastases are 20 to 132 times more common than primary cardiac tumors.[2,3] Previous studies have shown that up to 20% of oncology patients have metastases to the heart at autopsy.[4] Tumors can spread to the heart via 4 pathways: direct hematogenous spread, lymphatic spread, transvenous extension, and direct extension. Lung cancer is reported to be the most common cause of cardiac metastasis representing 36%-39% of all cardiac metastasis and is thought to spread to the pericardium and epicardium most commonly via the lymphatic route.[11,12]\n\n18F-FDG PET/CT is a useful modality for detecting sites of metastatic disease in cancer patients, however 18F-FDG PET/CT does not yet have an established role in routine evaluation of cardiac metastasis probably due to high physiological FDG uptake in the myocardium and significant inter- and intra-individual variability.[13] As a result, guidelines have been published which recommend patients to follow a specific preparation with high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet and fasting to shift myocardium metabolism toward fatty acid consumption in both oncology imaging and imaging for myocardial inflammation.[14,15] However, in a series of 24 patients with cardiac tumors who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT with standard oncological preparation (fasting period of at least 6 h), Rahbar and Colleagues found that malignant primary and cardiac metastasis can be determined from benign cardiac tumors with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 86% using a SUVmax threshold of 3.5 for benign lesions. [16] Liu suggested that SUVmax ratio between focal cardiac uptake and surrounding background uptake may help to differentiate malignant lesions from benign cardiac uptake on FDG PET/CT as true positive lesions had a SUVmax ratio of 4.5 \u00b1 1.5 vs 2.3 \u00b1 0.44 that of negative cardiac lesions (P < .05).[17]\n\nThe heart can be overlooked due variable physiological myocardial uptake, particularly on the MIP images, however missed cardiac metastasis can result in significant management changes for patients. This emphasizes that careful examination of the heart is required for oncological patients undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT with routine preparation and focal uptake should be carefully assessed for the possibility of cardiac metastasis. Future studies are awaited to further define and validate 18F-FDG PET/CT in the assessment of cardiac tumors.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe incidence of cardiac metastasis may not be as low as expected and lung cancer constitutes about one third of all cases. Identification of cardiac lesions with 18F-FDG PET/CT maybe challenging with routine preparation due high physiological FDG uptake in the myocardium and significant variability, nevertheless, as shown in this case focal FDG uptake should be carefully assessed for the possibility of cardiac metastasis.\n\nCompeting interests: none declared.\n\nPatient consent and permission for publication of this case was obtained.",

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nA case report on azathioprine-induced euprolactinemic galactorrhea.\n\nABSTRACT:\nGalactorrhea is characterized as an inappropriate discharge of milk-containing fluid from the breast. It has various causes including physiological and pathological. It may also be caused by many drugs. Although galactorrhea is usually associated with increased serum prolactin levels, it has been reported to occur in the absence of hyperprolactinemia. Cases of azathioprine-induced galactorrhea with normal prolactin level in a 22-year-old female patient with prurigo have been reported. It was noticed that the patient had no history of galactorrhea in the past.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nGalactorrhea, also known as nonpuerperal lactation, refers to a nonpurulent milky discharge from the breast, occurring with manual expression or either spontaneously, in the absence of pregnancy or postpartum state. Galactorrhea is most common symptom of hyperprolactinemia, reported occurring in up to 90% of women with hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia in turn may be drug induced (dopamine receptor antagonists, opioids, and verapamil); it could also associate with sellar and/pituitary adenomas. Hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, and nipple stimulation are some of its minor causes. Although mostly associated with raised serum prolactin levels, euprolactinemic galactorrhea, or galactorrhea without hyperprolactinemia, has also been reported.\n\nAzathioprine is an immunosuppressive medication, used alone or in combination with corticosteroids in patients for the prevention of transplant rejection. It is also used in autoimmune disorders such as, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and various dermatological complications. However, because of its adverse effect profile, use of azathioprine in dermatological conditions is limited to patients with severe disease. Myelosuppression, including leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, is a well-established adverse effect of azathioprine; however, pancreatitis, hepatitis, and hepatic veno-occlusive disease are rare caused by azathioprine.[1] Literature search revealed only one case reported related to azathioprine-induced hyperprolactinemia but without galactorrhea.[2] To the extent of our knowledge, no case of galactorrhea induced by azathioprine has been reported so far. Hence, this is the first case of galactorrhea after treatment with azathioprine, with normal prolactin level.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 22-year-old female unmarried patient weighted 62 kg with the complaint of prurigo presented to the dermatology outpatient department of tertiary care institute in Central India. The patient was prescribed Myfez (deflazocort) 30 mg daily, Dazit (desloratidine) 5 mg daily, and Calcicare (elemental calcium 250 mg + calcitriol 0.25 mcg + elemental zinc 7.5 mg) one tablet twice daily. Three weeks later, tablet thiorine (azathioprine) 50 mg, BD, by oral route was added as patient complained of an increase in itching. After 15 days of starting azathioprine, the patient developed a milky white discharge from both breasts. She continued azathioprine for two more weeks, then discontinued the drug, and galactorrhea resolved 8 days later. She came for follow-up 2 weeks after resolution of galactorrhea. At this time, she also gave a history of amenorrhea for 2 months, with her last menstrual period being 1 month before starting azathioprine. Physical examination revealed no abnormality. Laboratory investigations showed normal level of prolactin (result: 13.27 ng/ml, reference range: 2.8\u201329.2 ng/ml), cortisol (result: 4.08 mcg/dl, reference range: 3.1\u201316.7 ng/ml), luteinizing hormone (result: 5.46 m IU/ml, reference range: 1.9\u201312.5 m IU [follicular phase], 8.7\u201376.3 m IU [mid cycle peak], 0.5\u201316.9 m IU [luteal phase], 23\u2013116 m IU [postmenopausal phase], and follicle-stimulating hormone [result: 4.17 mU/ml, reference range: 2.5\u201310.2 mU [follicular phase], 3.4\u201333.4 mU [mid cycle peak], 1.5\u20139.1 mU [luteal phase], 15.9\u201354 mU [postmenopausal phase]). T3 and T4 were also normal, but the reports are not available. The patient was advised to stop azathioprine, however, the rest of medications are advised to continue. Using the World Health Organization causality assessment criteria, causality was determined as probable with azathioprine by the causality assessment committee of the concerned adverse drug reaction (ADR) Monitoring Centre. On the Naranjo ADR probability scale, the causality score was 6 which again indicates that the reaction is probable with azathioprine. The reaction has been reported to the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India through the in-house ADR Monitoring Centre, with a worldwide unique number at Uppsala Monitoring Center 2017-22689.\n\nDiscussion\n\nGalactorrhea with normal prolactin levels has been reported with antidepressants, which may induce galactorrhea with or without hyperprolactinemia.[3] Euprolactinemic galactorrhea has been reported not only particularly with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as escitalopram and paroxetine but also with tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline. Domperidone too has been reported to cause galactorrhea with normal prolactin levels. Till date, none of any case of galactorrhea with azathioprine has been reported. There is one case of azathioprine-induced hyperprolactinemia, but the patient did not have galactorrhea.\n\nThe mechanism of euprolactinemic galactorrhea is unclear. Hyperresponsive 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1A receptors, as well as increased tissue sensitivity to the metabolic and lactogenic actions of prolactin, have been postulated as possible explanations.[45] In the index case, the prolactin, as well as gonadotropin hormone levels, were found to be normal and there was no history of galactorrhea. Serum prolactin levels stayed in normal range with no hyperprolactinemia after the onset of galactorrhea. The patient was not taking any other medication known to cause hyperprolactinemia or galactorrhea. Moreover, galactorrhea resolved while other medications were continued. The patient also had no systemic illness associated with hyperprolactinemia or galactorrhea. Galactorrhea resolved after withdrawing azathioprine. We, therefore, postulate that her galactorrhea may have been caused by azathioprine.\n\nDeclaration of patient consent\n\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nDiffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage With Avelumab Maintenance Therapy.\n\nABSTRACT:\nImmune checkpoint blockade is a rapidly expanding therapeutic modality in oncology. However, its adverse effects extend beyond the cytotoxicity of conventional chemotherapy. Pneumotoxicity associated with immune checkpoint therapy presents a diagnostic conundrum that has been further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We report a case of a patient with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) following treatment with avelumab.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors have shown significant survival benefits in cancer patients and have revolutionized the outcomes of various malignancies having a better safety profile compared to chemotherapy [1, 2]. However, their adverse effects range from mild self-limiting to severe life-threatening side effects, which could potentially limit the use of these medications.\u00a0Avelumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)\u00a0of the intrinsic down regulators of immunity and that induces durable remissions in different tumor types [3]. First-line maintenance avelumab therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma was found to be associated with significantly prolonged overall survival [4, 5].\u00a0While increasing the activity of the immune system, such blockade can cause inflammatory side effects. The GI tract, liver, and skin are more commonly affected. Pulmonary, the central venous system, and cardiovascular involvement are also seen [6, 7]. A safety profile evaluation that analyzed 1,738 patients showed that patients receiving avelumab predominantly developed chills, pyrexia, and flushing, which may reflect the human Fc region-induced activation of innate immunity [8]. In an open-label phase 3 trial, 29.4% of patients had immune-related adverse events among the avelumab-treated patients, including 7% of patients with a grade 3 event. The most frequent category was thyroid disorders (12.2%) [4].\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 69-year-old Caucasian male presents with recurrent high-grade urothelial carcinoma with liver and osseous metastases. Four years ago, he was initially diagnosed with bladder carcinoma in situ and underwent transurethral resection followed by intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy, leading to remission. However, one year ago, he had hematuria and underwent cystoscopy, which showed an abnormal lesion of the trigone and bladder neck. Bladder washing suggested high-grade urothelial carcinoma. A subsequent transurethral resection revealed muscle-invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma. He was also found to have liver and widespread osseous metastases. The patient was started on chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine and achieved stabilization of disease after four cycles. He was switched to maintenance avelumab for seven months (four months after the diagnosis of metastases). His other past medical history included: cardiac arrest due to ischemic cardiomyopathy and status post coronary artery bypass surgery, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (diagnosed nine years ago, treated with rivaroxaban since then). He had a history of smoking for more than forty packs/year, quit for eight years, worked as a television producer, and occasionally played hockey games.\n\nThis time, he presented with one month of worsening shortness of breath and weakness. He was hypoxic, with oxygen saturation of 67% upon arrival at his oncology appointment. He was afebrile, alert, had scattered rhonchi and wheezes on lung auscultation. Laboratory results (Table 1) revealed mild leukocytosis. He had an elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LD). Hemoglobin and platelet counts were within the normal limit. Blood cultures and respiratory pathogen panel including SARS-COV2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were negative, c-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\u00a0(ANCA) and p-ANCA were also negative. CT\u00a0chest with intravenous contrast showed new diffuse bilateral ground glass and more consolidative airspace opacification and small bilateral pleural effusions (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal ejection function and no significant valvopathy. The patient\u2019s oxygen requirements increased on the second day of hospitalization, and he was transiently started on a high-flow nasal cannula with a 50% fraction of inspired oxygen FiO2 at 50 liters per minute (LPM). Flexible bronchoscopy revealed progressively more hemorrhagic lavage fluid (Figure 2) and bleeding from the right upper lobe. Transbronchial lung biopsies were performed, and samples were sent for cytology and culture. A cytology report from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed respiratory epithelial cells, pulmonary macrophages, and mixed inflammatory cells and negative for malignant cells. Cytology of right upper lobe core biopsy was positive for CK7 immunostaining. Uroplakin II immunostaining was focally positive. P40, CK20, and p63 immunostains were negative. GATA-3 immunostain was equivocal. Given the limited tumor cells in the biopsy, the primary source of the tumor could not be identified. Although the urothelial origin of the tumor was favored, rivaroxaban was discontinued. The patient was started on methylprednisolone 250 mg daily for three days after the bronchoscopy, then switched to 60 mg daily. The avelumab was not restarted since this hospitalization. However, the patient died eight days after admission due to respiratory failure despite all treatment attempts.\n\nTable 1 Clinical laboratory results.\n\nVariable\tReference Range\tOn Admission\t\nWhite cell count (K/uL)\t4.00-10.80\t11.45\t\nAbsolute neutrophils (K/uL)\t1.80-7.70\t9.13\t\nHemoglobin (g/dL)\t14.0-16.8\t13.4\t\nHematocrit (%)\t40.0-48.4\t40.2\t\nPlatelet count (K/uL)\t140-400\t301\t\nBrain natriuretic peptide (pg/mL)\t<300\t3,603\t\nC-reactive protein (mg/L)\t<=5\t99\t\nLactate dehydrogenase \u00a0(U/L)\t<=250\t418\t\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/L)\t35-130\t226\t\n\nFigure 1 Diffuse bilateral ground glass and more consolidative airspace opacification and small bilateral pleural effusions.\n\nFigure 2 Flexible bronchoscopy revealed progressively more hemorrhagic lavage fluid.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur patient on maintenance avelumab for metastatic urothelial carcinoma presented with subacute dyspnea attributed to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). DAH, as an uncommon type of lung injury, is rarely documented in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We hypothesize that DAH is related to the use of avelumab, which may potentially increase the risk of hemorrhage in metastatic cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first case of avelumab-induced DAH in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma reported in the literature.\n\nTo date, DAH caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported in a few case reports and case series. Shannon et\u00a0al.\u00a0presented a case of fatal DAH following nivolumab therapy [9]. Takahashi et al. described the development of Goodpasture\u2019s disease after eight cycles of nivolumab treatment with hemoptysis symptoms and diffuse ground-glass opacities on the CT scan. The patient died despite methylprednisolone pulse therapy and plasma exchange [10]. In another case of nivolumab-induced DAH, with three days of methylprednisolone pulse administration (1 g/day) followed by prednisolone therapy (40 mg/day), the patient demonstrated clinical improvement with the disappearance of ground-glass opacities [11]. Sugano et al. highlighted the relationship between interstitial lung disease with alveolar hemorrhage and pembrolizumab treatment in a patient without respiratory symptoms [12].\n\nPatients with DAH can present with hemoptysis and dyspnea, in our case, it developed after seven months of avelumab maintenance treatment. However, hemoptysis may be absent in one-third of patients at presentation [13]. This raises the concern of underdiagnosed PD-L1 inhibitor-induced DAH due to nonspecific symptomatology in our patient and immune checkpoint inhibitors associated DAH reported by others. Characteristic radiographic findings include diffuse ground glass or consolidative opacities and tend to be more central than peripheral [14]. The diagnosis of DAH is supported by findings of progressively more hemorrhagic lavage returns during sequential BAL\u00a0and the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages on cytologic staining [15]. Other serum findings, such as leukocytosis, the elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and CRP, can also be seen but not specific.\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology of avelumab-induced DAH is still unknown. However, the potential mechanisms may include pneumonitis caused by dysregulated immunologic homeostasis, increasing T-cell activity, increasing levels of preexisting autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines, and enhancement of complement-mediated inflammation [6, 16]. The subsequent disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane caused bleeding into the alveolar spaces in the setting of long-term anticoagulation therapy. Rivaroxaban-associated alveolar hemorrhage is also rare, and no definitive evidence of a direct causative relationship has been established [17]. In our case, rivaroxaban was started nine years ago, which is unlikely to cause the recent hemorrhage. Kanaoka et al. described bland pulmonary hemorrhage as a histopathological feature in a case of durvalumab-induced DAH. The author also argues for CD4 and CD8 immunostaining as essential in distinguishing lung injury as an immune-related adverse event from other types of lung injuries [18].\n\nThe relationship between immune checkpoint inhibitors and the incidence of treatment-related DAH has not been well studied. In addition to causative drug discontinuation and airway supportive care, high-dose methylprednisolone therapy may have a critical role if the alveolar hemorrhage is suspected to be immune-mediated [19]. Previous studies also suggested responses can be elicited by the steroids in immune checkpoint inhibitors induced DAH [11, 12]. The treatment should not be delayed while pending etiology evaluation due to the high mortality. Intermittent intravenous pulse dose can be considered to minimize treatment-related complications, including bone marrow suppression and opportunistic infections.\n\nConclusions\n\nAvelumab-induced DAH remains a diagnostic challenge that is based on excluding other potential causes in a usually complex clinical context. Early recognition and discontinuation of the offending medication are crucial. Our case reinforces the importance of being vigilant with patients on avelumab who present with progressive dyspnea and suspicion of DAH, as early recognition and treatment can be lifesaving. DAH should also be suspected in patients receiving avelumab with ground glass or consolidative lesions on imaging studies. Prompt bronchoscopy and sequential BAL can expedite the evaluation, even in the absence of hemoptysis and decreasing hemoglobin level. The multidisciplinary discussion also serves as a key part of the diagnostic decision-making process given the wide range of potential organ system involvement. Future evaluation regarding management, monitoring, and preventive strategies is warranted.\n\nHuman Ethics\n\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study",

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nAdvanced Leiomyosarcoma of the Retroperitoneal Space in a Kidney Transplant Recipient with a History of Peritoneal Dialysis: A Case Report.\n\nABSTRACT:\nBACKGROUND Leiomyosarcoma frequently occurs in patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy. It is the second most common sarcoma in this population and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. We present a case of advanced leiomyosarcoma of the retroperitoneal space in a kidney transplant recipient and discuss additional risk factors for oncogenesis. CASE REPORT A 44-year-old woman with a history of peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation was diagnosed with multiple liver lesions. PET-CT scanning showed a metabolically active tumor in the left lumbar region with numerous liver focal lesions. The histological examination of the liver lesion biopsy identified advanced retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma with a high proliferative index and liver involvement. Unexpectedly, the relation with EBV infection was not proven. The patient was treated with first-line doxorubicin, with the simultaneous reduction of immunosuppression. Owing to disease progression after 6 cycles, the patient received second-line chemotherapy based on gemcitabine and docetaxel, which was terminated owing to unacceptable toxicity, despite an observed response. Third-line trabectedin-based therapy with good tolerance and stabilization of disease after 20 months was being maintained at the time of this report. CONCLUSIONS The increased cancer mortality in solid-organ transplant recipients requires an individualized approach and increased post-transplantation screening according to additional specific cancer risk factors. A further consideration is the hypothetical relevance of long-term peritoneal membrane irritation in peritoneal dialysis patients.\n\nTEXT:\npmcBackground\n\nLeiomyosarcoma is the second most common sarcoma after Kaposi sarcoma in patients undergoing maintenance of immunosuppressive treatment [1] and is one of the most common soft-tissue sarcomas in the general population [2]. It derives from smooth muscle cells of large veins or mesenchymal stem cells and is usually located in the retroperitoneal space. Of note, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in immunocompromised patients (including HIV-infected and organ transplant recipients) has been widely discussed as a potential risk factor for leiomyosarcoma [2,3] and its multifocal development [4]. Immunohistochemical assays fail to confirm the presence of viral genetic material in only 12% of cases [1].\n\nIt has been shown that the overall length and the net effect of immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of carcinogenesis [5]. It is believed that increased gene expression for transforming growth factor beta-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor during therapy with certain immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine A and tacrolimus, can promote tumor invasiveness and metastatic dissemination [6].\n\nCase Report\n\nA 44-year-old woman was admitted to the nephrology department with multiple liver lesions of unknown origin, which were identified during an abdominal ultrasound in January 2019. She had a Zubrod performance status of 0 and had a history of kidney transplantation (KTx) from a deceased donor, with basiliximab induction in May 2016 on a 3-drug maintenance immunosuppressive regimen (tacrolimus, mycophenolate sodium, and prednisone). She had experienced mild right upper abdominal pain for a few months prior to her presentation, which did not require painkillers.\n\nThe patient had a medical history of right-sided nephrectomy and systemic therapy for nephroblastoma at the age of 6 years. She had chronic interstitial pyelonephritis of the remaining kidney, not associated with ureterovesical reflux and without confirmed immune deficiencies, which eventually led to end-stage kidney failure, with the initiation of automated peritoneal dialysis for 27 months before KTx. Comorbidity included type 2 diabetes and subtotal thyroidectomy, with parathyroidectomy performed in October 2015 owing to secondary hyperparathyroidism and a colloid goiter.\n\nThe patient\u2019s laboratory tests performed on admission were within the reference range with optimal kidney graft function (serum creatinine concentration of 1.1 mg/dL; normal urinalysis).\n\nShe underwent an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed more than 25 poorly vascularized metastatic lesions in the liver. The lesions were an average diameter of 10 mm to 25 mm, and there was a 38-mm tumor in the small pelvis next to the left iliac vessel (adhered to the larger lumbar muscle on the left side, left iliac artery, and the small intestinal loop), with heterogeneous gaining after administration of contrast media. A similar lesion of 25\u00d730 mm was found in the fundus of the uterus. We performed a PET-CT scan with 18F-FDG in search of the primary lesion. The scan revealed a metabolically active tumor in the left lumbar region, sized 49\u00d741\u00d744 mm (Figure 1A), and numerous liver focal lesions up to 22 mm (Figure 1B).\n\nThe patient underwent an ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the liver lesions.\n\nHistological examination revealed metastasis of sarcoma, which was composed of large atypical, elongated cells with abundant, fibrillary cytoplasm forming irregular cellular fascicles (Figure 1C). Immunohistochemical staining revealed extensive expression of smooth muscle actin (Figure 1D, 1F), desmin (Figure 1E, 1G), and high Ki67 proliferative index (Figure 1H) but did not detect any expression of ALK-1 protein, HMB45, neuron-specific enolase, DOG-1, S-100 protein, or cytokeratines 34 and 117. The specimens also stained negative for EBV.\n\nTherefore, a diagnosis of advanced retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma with liver involvement was established (cT1N0M1 CS IV).\n\nThe patient started chemotherapy with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 every 21 days. The dosage of mycophenolate sodium was reduced from 1260 to 540 mg daily, and trough levels of tacrolimus were maintained at approximately 6 ng/mL. The patient\u2019s tolerance of the first-line chemotherapy was good and she received subsequent cycles without delay. She did not experience any adverse events, including infectious complications and neutropenic fever.\n\nUnfortunately, CT imaging after administration of 6 cycles showed progression in the primary retroperitoneal lesion and in the liver, with metastasis merging into a conglomerate of 64\u00d751\u00d750 mm. Owing to disease progression, the patient received a second-line chemotherapy based on gemcitabine (900 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) and docetaxel (100 mg/m2 on day 8) every 3 weeks. Despite the use of adequate premedication, she presented significant toxicity that was aggravated with every administration of docetaxel, including subcutaneous edema of the upper and lower extremities, generalized sensory neuropathy (CTCAE G3), and erythematous-desquamative lesions on the face and neck. Despite a mild size reduction of the primary lesion (by 19%) and metastatic lesions in the liver (stable disease, according to RECIST 1.1), we terminated the second-line chemotherapy owing to unacceptable toxicity. The patient was referred to another oncology center with access to trabectedin-based therapy. Since January 2020, the patient has been continuing courses of trabectedin (1.5 mg/m2 every 21 days) with good tolerance and maintenance of stable disease status, reaching over 31 months of overall survival since the initial diagnosis. The kidney graft function is still excellent, despite a mycophenolate dosage reduction to 360 mg daily.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSoft-tissue sarcomas in patients after solid-organ transplantation usually have higher histological grading, and about 40% of patients are diagnosed in the metastatic phase of the disease [7]. Oncological treatment in patients with KTx should include all conventional pharmacological approaches, along with the concomitant consideration of the reduction of immunosuppression dosage. The median overall survival for advanced disease does not exceed 15 months [7].\n\nIncreased cancer risk is one of the major concerns in solid-organ transplant recipients. The 10-year risk of de novo cancer is twice as great in transplant recipients than in the general population [8]. De novo malignancies have tremendous impact on survival after solid-organ transplantation, as they have been reported as a leading cause of late mortality after transplantation [9]. One of the main causes of increased cancer incidence among patients with transplants is the common use of more intensive immunosuppressive therapies [10]. In KTx recipients, the use of tacrolimus and induction antibodies was proven to increase the risk of de novo post-transplantation malignancy [11]. It is worth noting that increased oncogenesis is observed already at the stage of chronic kidney disease and dialysis therapy [11,12]. Furthermore, the increasing age of the transplant population, longer organ survival, and exposure to oncogenic viruses also contribute to increased malignancy rates after transplantation [13,14].\n\nAlthough soft-tissue sarcomas remain a rare type of cancer in KTx recipients, soft-tissue sarcomas are significantly more common in KTx recipients than in the general population: the standardized incidence ratio is 14.4 (95% CI: 9.2\u201319.5) in male patients and 4.5 (95% CI: 0.6\u20138.5) in female patients [15]. The diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma is often accidental and can occur at any point after transplantation. Interestingly, a different pattern of the primary location has been observed in patients with KTx, with 33% occurring in the head and neck, compared with only 5% in the head and neck in the general population [7,16].\n\nIn the present case, the specimen derived from the tumor did not demonstrate EBV activity. However, pre-transplantation EBV-positive recipient status in itself has been demonstrated to increase the risk of post-transplantation malignancy [13]. Nevertheless, several circumstances can be identified as potential factors that were conducive to the development of sarcoma in our patient. Above all, was the immunosuppressive therapy she received. Second, we cannot exclude a hypothetical relevance of the long-term exposure to dialysis fluid as an additional risk factor for carcinogenesis. It has been demonstrated that the high-glucose load in peritoneal dialysis fluid increases the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). AGEs then exert cancer-promoting effects, mediated by an interaction with the receptor for AGEs and increased oxidative stress, in addition to chronic inflammatory responses [17], which have been shown to be strong contributors of carcinogenesis [18,19]. Moreover, metabolic complications such as insulin resistance and low plasma adiponectin levels have been associated with the increased risk of malignancy, even in nondiabetic peritoneal dialysis patients [20]. Hence, we cannot exclude that, in our patient, peritoneal dialysis treatment and diabetes alongside immunosuppression might have been involved in the pathogenesis of the retroperitoneal sarcoma.\n\nConclusions\n\nCertainly, substantially prolonged survival after KTx increases the cancer incidence and mortality in this cohort. According to a recent report, mortality attributable to cancer steadily increases after transplantation, reaching 15.7% of deaths in recipients that are more than 10 years past transplantation [21]. Despite regular ambulatory monitoring, cancers in KTx recipients are diagnosed in a more advanced stage as compared with those in the general population [22]. Importantly, imaging during this period is focused mainly on assessment of the graft and cirrhotic kidneys, and the guidelines for cancer screening vary greatly, depending on the screened organ, except for skin cancer [23]. Because patients after KTx present a markedly increased risk of malignancy complications, we strongly suggest individualizing post-transplantation screening, considering individual cancer risk, comorbidities, overall prognosis, and screening preferences.\n\nFigure 1.

We present the case of a 30-year-old gravida 3, para 2-0-0-2, at 26 weeks 2 days gestation who presented with eleven days of vague and indolent symptoms before a diagnosis of disseminated HSV-2 infection with associated hepatitis was made. While the patient clinically improved with empiric acyclovir treatment, possibility of significant harm to the fetus remained, and the patient request elective termination. The authors review the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of disseminated HSV-2 infection in pregnancy.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nOf the approximately 2\u20133% of women who acquire primary genital herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection during pregnancy, the most dangerous complication is disseminated, systemic infection. With mortality rates up to 50 %, fortunately disseminated HSV-2 remains a rare entity [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Disseminated HSV-2 demonstrates an affinity for the second half of pregnancy, with 65 % of cases occurring in the third trimester; and an overall 50 % risk of transplacental infection [[5], [6], [7]]. Disseminated HSV-2 hepatitis during pregnancy may progress to fulminant liver failure and is a large contributor to maternal mortality approaching 50 % [8,9]. Acyclovir treatment poses minimal fetal risk and may significantly improve maternal clinical outcomes, although successful maternal therapy may not equate to successful fetal therapy [10,11]. Herein, we report the first elective mid-trimester termination in the setting of maternal disseminated HSV-2 disease with associated hepatitis.\n\nCase\n\nA 30-year-old gravida 3, para 2\u22120-0\u22122 presented to our tertiary care center at 26 weeks 2 days gestation with fever, malaise, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and dysuria for the past eleven days. She denied significant past medical or surgical history, and her only medication was a prenatal vitamin. She had two prior uncomplicated term vaginal deliveries and denied any prior sexually transmitted infections.\n\nShe initially presented to a community emergency department at 245/7 weeks with vaginal bleeding and was discharged following a normal pelvic exam. She next presented to our emergency department at 251/7 weeks with a two-day history of urinary frequency and dysuria. She was afebrile and was discharged with empiric nitrofurantoin. At 253/7 weeks, she presented to a second community emergency department with worsening malaise, abdominal and low back pain, and was discharged following a reassuring exam. She presented to the same emergency department at 255/7 weeks with persistent symptoms. Rapid influenza and respiratory viral panel were negative, and she was discharged with a course of azithromycin for empiric pneumonia treatment.\n\nAt 261/7 weeks gestation, she presented a third time to the community emergency department, now intermittently febrile up to 39.5 \u00b0C without localizing symptoms and was admitted for further evaluation. Speculum exam demonstrated clear vaginal fluid, which was nitrazine positive and negative for amniotic ferning. Serum studies were significant for transaminitis, which progressed from twice the upper limit of normal to an ALT of 200 U/L and AST 4of 20 U/L over a two-day admission, with normal total bilirubin. Pertinent negative infectious evaluation included influenza and respiratory syncytial viral (RSV) panels, viral hepatitis panel, urinalysis and culture, and blood cultures. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and right upper quadrant ultrasound were unrevealing. She received empiric therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam and was discharged within 24 h.\n\nThe following day, the patient presented to our tertiary care facility at 262/7 gestation, complaining of chills, malaise, fever to 39.4 \u00b0C, new onset of shortness of breath, dry cough, headache, and copious vaginal discharge over the prior three days. Upon arrival, she was febrile to 39.2 \u00b0C, tachycardic to 121 beats per minute, and normotensive with normal oxygen saturation. Physical exam elicited exquisite umbilical, suprapubic, and left flank tenderness. Sterile speculum exam revealed copious thick yellow vaginal fluid and scant pinpoint white cervical lesions, both of which were swabbed for culture and viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Vaginal fluid was nitrazine positive; however, microscopy did not reveal amniotic ferns, lowering the suspicion for premature rupture of membranes. The cervix was closed and there was no evidence of active labor. Obstetric ultrasound confirmed a viable fetus with biometry consistent with prior dating. Anatomic survey was normal.\n\nAdmission laboratory studies were remarkable for worsening transaminitis compared to her prior admission, with ALT 265 U/L and AST 602 U/L, with total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dl. Complete blood count showed WBC 5.36 \u00d7 103/mm3 with 10.6 % banded neutrophils. Hemoglobin was 10.5 gm/dL, hematocrit was 28.5 %.and creatinine was 0.42 mg/dL. Serum C-reactive protein was elevated at 265.2 mg/L. Urinalysis was significant for moderate ketonuria and leukocyte esterase, many squamous cells and leukocytes, few erythrocytes, and no bacteriuria. Hepatobiliary ultrasound was unremarkable.\n\nThe patient\u2019s exposure history was significant for work in a daycare setting and cat ownership. Additionally, the father of the current pregnancy engaged in recent non-monogamous activity. Due to maternal and neonatal acuity as well as refractory symptoms and clinical status, prompt ultrasound-guided amniocentesis on day of admission evaluated for intraamniotic infection (IAI). Indigo carmine intraamniotic infusion and tampon test were negative, confirming intact amniotic membranes. Rapid testing of amniotic fluid revealed manual leukocyte count of 16 cells/cmm, and fluid glucose of 22 mg/dL, with present neutrophils and absent bacteria, felt to be most consistent with a viral IAI, though bacterial etiology was not dismissed.\n\nDue to the concern for IAI, on hospital day one empiric intravenous ertapenem (1 g daily) and oral azithromycin (500 mg daily) were initiated. Worsening transaminitis through hospital day two (ALT 302 U/L, AST 714 U/L) was initially attributed to sepsis secondary to IAI. The patient\u2019s serum INR and mental status remained normal.\n\nPertinent negative maternal testing included influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus nasopharyngeal PCR, serologies for toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and syphilis, Mono-spot, and HIV screening. Urine culture, chlamydia and gonorrhea PCR, and vaginal Group B Streptococcus PCR were negative. Blood and amniotic fluid cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria demonstrated no growth.\n\nLater on hospital day two, HSV-2 PCR of a cervical lesion returned positive and she was started on intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 h). She denied prior oral or genital symptoms or knowledge of HSV-2 infection. As her partner endorsed a history of recent multiple sexual partners, a primary HSV-2 infection was suspected. On hospital day three, HSV-2 PCR of amniotic fluid and serum also returned positive, consistent with disseminated HSV-2 infection with associated hepatitis and suspected congenital infection of the fetus.\n\nErtapenem and azithromycin were discontinued. After 24 h of acyclovir therapy, her fever resolved, and transaminitis began down trending. By hospital day four, transaminitis began to resolve, there was no evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction or hepatic failure, and she thereafter remained consistently afebrile.\n\nWhile the patient clinically improved after diagnosis and initiation of targeted therapy, she had ongoing concerns about the fetal and neonatal implications of her diagnosis, and ultimately, she requested pregnancy termination. A multidisciplinary care team, including Maternal Fetal Medicine, Clinical Ethics, and Infectious Disease, was assembled to review the patient\u2019s desire for termination, as well as fetal implications of HSV-2 positive amniotic fluid. The committee determined there was reasonable possibility of significant fetal harm due to maternal primary disseminated HSV-2 infection with evidence of transplacental transmission. The patient ultimately elected to terminate the pregnancy.\n\nFeticide was performed by ultrasound-guided intracardiac injection of potassium chloride on hospital day seven, at 27 weeks 1 day. Upon confirmation of fetal demise, induction of labor was performed by administration of mifepristone, followed by high dose misoprostol, according to Society of Family Planning published practice guidelines [12,13]. During her labor course, she developed pre-eclampsia without severe features. After a three-day induction, the patient delivered a demised male fetus.\n\nPlacental histopathology was significant for high grade fetal vascular malperfusion, acute chorioamnionitis and funisitis, focal chronic chorionic plate vasculitis, and necrotic stromal cells. While there was no evidence of viral cytopathic effect and HSV-2 immunostaining was negative, intradepartmental review determined the findings to be consistent with transplacental HSV-2 infection in the setting of disseminated maternal disease. Fetal autopsy was declined by the patient.\n\nThe patient was discharged on hospital day ten, shortly after delivery. She was transitioned to oral valacyclovir 1 g every 8 h, to complete a 21-day total course. Upon outpatient follow-up she remained afebrile with complete resolution of transaminitis and no evidence of hepatic dysfunction.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs illustrated here, the diagnosis of disseminated HSV-2 infection during pregnancy can be challenging. Women frequently report no history of HSV-2 infection, and characteristic herpetic lesions may be absent. Providers frequently consider a broad differential, including pre-eclampsia and acute fatty liver. Definitive diagnosis by liver biopsy can be difficult in the pregnancy setting, especially if hepatitis has progressed to a coagulopathic state. Although treatment with acyclovir can result in a successful maternal outcome, disseminated HSV-2 in pregnancy is an overall highly morbid disease for both mother and fetus, and the effect of acyclovir on the fetus remains unclear [10,11,[14], [15], [16]].\n\nThis is borne out in a disseminated HSV-2 case described by Sloan et al. in which second trimester maternal therapy was initially reassuring; however, third trimester fetal ultrasound revealed severe cerebral findings consistent with encephalitis and ultimately neonatal demise [17]. Johansson et al. describe a patient with a self-resolving first trimester flu-like illness, who delivered a preterm neonate severely affected by classic and non-classic constellation of congenital HSV-2 sequelae [18]. This presents in stark contrast to those cases that report successful maternal and neonatal outcomes with acyclovir treatment [14,[19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. While the advent of PCR testing for HSV-2 in amniotic fluid is a useful tool confirming maternal diagnosis in addition to viral culture, neither has been demonstrated to clearly correlate with reduced neonatal morbidity [20,24].\n\nNeonatal HSV-2 infection affects an estimated 1500 live births annually in the United States with substantial resource utilization [[25], [26], [27]]. Attempts have been made to characterize a classic triad of neonatal presentation including central nervous system, ophthalmologic, and cutaneous involvement, however in cases of intrauterine infection, congenital HSV does not appear to be limited to these manifestations, comprising a spectrum including extremity and bony malformations, altered growth, hydrops, cerebral abnormalities, and fetal demise [[28], [29], [30]]. In a review of 64 cases of intrauterine HSV infection diagnosed prenatally and postnatally, cutaneous lesions were identified in 95 % of cases, while CNS abnormalities were identified in 67 % cases [28]. In 36 cases of congenital HSV infection, 15 were described prenatally, with cerebral anomalies the most commonly reported, and 21 were diagnosed postnatally, most commonly with cutaneous findings that developed in the first weeks of life [29]. Fetal diagnostic imaging including ultrasound and MRI have limited utility in successfully identifying cutaneous manifestations, which can be extensive, as well as determining neurodevelopmental prognosis, as normal anatomic survey does not guarantee a normal neonatal outcome [29,31].\n\nEarly diagnosis of disseminated HSV in pregnancy with acyclovir treatment is often delayed, yet critical in improving maternal outcomes. The literature demonstrates that maternal treatment and reassuring fetal imaging do not guarantee a normal neonatal outcome [17,18]. While intrapartum demise and withholding or withdrawal of supportive care in the immediate postnatal setting have been described in clearly affected neonates [28], this is the first report of an elective mid-trimester induction termination in the setting of maternal disseminated HSV-2 hepatitis.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nLauren Bougioukas, BA: conceptualization, patient care, writing: original draft; writing: review & editing\n\nRachel B.C.

Emerging evidence shows that COVID-19 leads to a prothrombotic state and its association with pulmonary thromboembolism is well established. However, clinicians and the vascular community, in particular, should watch out for the nonpulmonary targets of this lethal virus as the failure to do so could give rise to disastrous consequences. The significance of raised D-dimer levels, whether it translates into thrombotic events for all patients and the need for universal oral anticoagulation postdischarge are issues that need urgent answers. We report a case series of five patients with thrombosis involving nonpulmonary sites. How to cite this article: Kaneria MV, Nadaf S, Desai U. Clots in COVID: A Case Series. Indian J Crit Care Med 2021;25(7):817-821.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nSince the report of the first COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, there is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19.1 Although respiratory failure remains the tipping point and the main cause of mortality in moderate or severe COVID-19, several cardiovascular complications and numerous cases of the thromboembolic disease have been reported.2,3\n\nThrombotic events can occur during COVID-19 as a presenting feature or may occur during convalescence and give rise to lethal consequences.\n\nSevere arterial thrombotic complications have been seen despite the use of antiplatelet and or anticoagulant therapy, in both severe and nonsevere COVID. We report a case series of five patients (two cases with acute onset stroke, two with acute onset lower limb ischemia, and one with cephalic vein thrombosis) who presented with thrombotic complications to our dedicated COVID hospital.\n\nCase Descriptions\n\nCase 1\n\nA 50-year-old male, with no existing comorbidities, presented with sudden onset altered sensorium and inability to move the left half of the body. There was no history of fever, vomiting, headache, seizures, diarrhea, or any respiratory complaints. There were no h/o transient ischemic attacks, trauma, or any addictions. As per existing protocol, a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab (RT-PCR) for COVID 19 was performed at admission, which was positive. The patient had been confined to his home for the past 3 months in view of the lockdown imposed. None of his family members were positive for COVID. On examination, he was drowsy but arousable. He was afebrile, jugular venous pressure not raised, pulse of 90 beats/minute, regular rhythm, and BP of 160/80 mm Hg. The respiratory rate was 14/minute and the saturation on ambient air was 98%. He moved only the right side on stimulus. There was no neck rigidity and the power was grade 0/5 in the left upper and lower extremity, with the left plantar being extensor. There was a left upper motor neuron facial palsy. The right carotid was feeble to palpate. The rest of the systemic examination including the respiratory and cardiac examinations was unremarkable.\n\nThe total counts were 12,100/mm3, Hb 13.4 g/dL, platelet count 3,02,000/mm3, ESR 100 mm/hour. Renal and liver function tests and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. Fasting blood sugar was 112 mg%. The HbA1C was 5.6 and the lipid profile was normal. The inflammatory markers were all elevated viz. C reactive protein (CRP) >100 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 898 U/L, and serum ferritin 1254.7 ng/mL. Serum interleukin levels were >24 pg/mL (NR <7 pg/mL) and D-dimer was 10,000 ng/mL (NR <500). Arterial blood gases were normal with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio >300. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with no e/o left ventricular hypertrophy. 2D echo was normal. HRCT thorax showed bilateral, peripheral rounded ground glass opacities with a CORAD score of 4/6 and 10 to 15% involvement of the lungs.\n\nCT brain showed a large well-defined intra-axial hypodensity, involving right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory (subacute infarct) with mass effect in the form of adjacent sulcal and cisternal spaces with ipsilateral lateral ventricle and ipsilateral uncal herniation.\n\nCT brain angiography showed partial filling defect (lumen occluding thrombus) in the right distal common carotid artery (4.7 cm) (Fig.1); a complete filling defect in the entire right internal carotid artery and trunk of the external carotid artery (complete lumen occluding thrombus); nonopacification of right MCA with hyperdense MCA sign (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 1 Partial filling defect (lumen occluding thrombus) in the right distal common carotid artery in Case 1\n\nFig. 2 Nonopacification of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) with hyperdense MCA sign in Case 1\n\nThe patient was treated with intravenous dexamethasone (for raised intracranial tension), subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin 0.6 mg bd, oral ivermectin 12 mg single dose, and vitamins A, C, D with zinc as per existing local COVID treatment guidelines and supportive treatment including physiotherapy. Low-dose aspirin and statin were added to the regimen. His BP and blood sugars were within normal limits throughout the stay. Arterial saturation was maintained on room air throughout the hospital stay.\n\nHis subsequent D-dimer after 7 days rose to 25,000 ng/mL and swab converted to RT-PCR negative after 3 weeks of hospital stay, after which he was discharged on oral rivaroxaban 10 mg OD for 4 weeks.\n\nCase 2\n\nA 63-year-old male, known hypertensive since 10 years on regular antihypertensives (telmisartan and amlodipine), presented with increasing breathlessness, slurred speech, imbalance, and inability to see objects since 2 days. He gave a h/o fever and minor respiratory symptoms 15 days earlier, when he was diagnosed as COVID on the basis of a positive RT-PCR and also tested positive for vivax on rapid malaria antigen test. He was admitted for isolation in a COVID care center (CCC) and subsequently transferred to our tertiary care institute in view of worsening clinical condition. On examination, his condition was critical, afebrile, BP was 170/86 mm Hg, pulse 90/minute with a regular rhythm, respiratory rate was 30/minute, and saturation was 88% on room air. The PaO2/ FiO2 ratio was 250. He was drowsy but arousable and moving limbs very minimally on stimulus. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral crepitations throughout the lung fields. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable. The inflammatory markers were raised viz. ESR 103 mm/hour, LDH 695 U/L, CRP 156 mg/L, ferritin 2536 ng/mL, and D-dimer was >15,000 ng/mL. His interleukin 6 level was >5,500 pg/mL. The rest of the biochemical investigations were normal except for a platelet count of 45,000/mm3. ECG showed borderline left ventricular hypertrophy and 2D echo was normal.\n\nHRCT thorax performed on admission showed changes s/o COVID with 50\u201375% lung involvement. CT brain showed acute infarct in the bilateral occipital lobe, chronic ischemic changes in bilateral frontoparietal, periventricular white matter, lacunar infarcts in bilateral gangliocapsular region (basilar stroke), and corona radiata. There was severe lower and mid basilar cutoff and upper basilar hyperdensity s/o acute progressing thrombus.\n\nHe was put on nonrebreathing bag and mask (NRBM) with an oxygen flow of 15 L and treated with COVID treatment protocol (ivermectin, azithromycin, methylprednisolone, low molecular weight heparin) antimalarials, and supportive care. Tocilizumab, an interleukin 6 receptor antagonist, was also given in view of the cytokine storm. His condition deteriorated on day 2 of admission and he succumbed.\n\nCase 3\n\nA 63-year-old male, k/c/o diabetes and hypertension, presented with increasing breathlessness since 7 days and right lower limb pain and discoloration of toes. He had minor respiratory complaints 15 days ago for which he took symptomatic treatment. He tested positive for COVID RT-PCR. There were no other major complaints. On examination, he was stable, afebrile with a respiratory rate of 14/minute, BP of 130/80 mm Hg, absent right dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulsations. There was bluish discoloration of toes on the right lower extremity. All other peripheral pulsations were well felt. His saturation was 92% on room air, which increased to 98% on 4 L oxygen by nasal prongs. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.\n\nHis inflammatory markers (CRP, LDH, ferritin, ESR) were all elevated. D-dimer was >15,000 ng/mL. Interleukin 6 levels were 5337.6 pg/mL. Prothrombin time, prothrombin index, and INR were all normal. Hemogram and rest of the biochemical parameters were normal. HRCT thorax showed 50\u201360% lung involvement (CORADS 6). ECG and 2D echo were within normal limits. USG Doppler revealed the absence of color flow in right anterior tibial (ATA), posterior tibial (PTA), and dorsalis pedis arteries (DPA). CT angiography of lower extremities showed atherocalcific changes in distal abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries not causing significant luminal obstruction and thrombus in the abdominal aorta (Fig. 3). Nonopacification of proximal two-third of left superficial femoral artery, distal one-third of ATA, right tibioperoneal trunk, right anterior and posterior arteries in the entire extent, bilateral PTAs s/o complete lumen occluding thrombosis.\n\nFig. 3 Thrombus in the abdominal aorta of Case 3\n\nHe was treated with oxygen by nasal prongs, intravenous methylprednisolone, low molecular weight heparin, ivermectin, doxycycline, and vitamins. Low-dose aspirin, statin, cilostazol, and pentoxifylline were also added. Blood sugars were monitored and controlled with insulin. Conservative treatment was advised by the cardiovascular thoracic surgeon. The patient gradually recovered and was discharged after around 45 days when the swab converted to negative. Oral rivaroxaban 10 mg OD was added for 1 month as his predischarge D-dimer was significantly raised.\n\nCase 4\n\nA 53-year-old male, k/c/o diabetes and hypertension, presented with increasing breathlessness since 2 days and bluish discoloration of all the phalanges of the left lower limb (Fig. 4). He was admitted with mild respiratory symptoms and COVID positive status at another hospital 20 days ago, treated, and subsequently discharged from there. On examination, he was afebrile, tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 40/minute, saturation of 80% on room air, and hemodynamically stable. His left lower extremity was cold with the absence of left femoral, left tibial, and left dorsalis pedis pulsations. His CT angiography of the lower limbs showed a complete lumen occluding thrombus in the left popliteal artery, distal to the knee joint (Fig. 5). HRCT thorax showed COVID pneumonia with 50\u201375% lung involvement. His blood investigations revealed a leukocytosis of 44,500/mm3, INR of 1.55, and D-dimer >20,000 ng/mL. The inflammatory markers were all raised. He was started on BiPAP with a FiO2 of 85%. Conservative treatment was decided by a multidisciplinary team considering the severity of respiratory distress. However, he succumbed shortly after admission.\n\nFig. 4 Bluish discoloration of the toes in Case 4\n\nFig. 5 Lumen occluding thrombus in the left popliteal artery in Case 4\n\nCase 5\n\nA 25-year-old female, a frontline healthcare worker with no comorbidities, presented with fever and mild respiratory symptoms of 5 days duration. She tested positive for COVID RT-PCR and was hospitalized. She was stable and her general and systemic examination was normal, except for fever. Saturation on room air was 98%. HRCT thorax showed <10% involvement of the lungs. Her CRP, ferritin, LDH, and ESR were slightly raised and D-dimer was >15,000. The rest of the biochemical parameters were normal except for a total count of 16,500/mm3. She was treated with ivermectin, Doxy, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamins. Intravenous ceftriaxone was given for a day in view of fever and leukocytosis but was stopped the next day as her fever subsided, counts declined, and the serum procalcitonin was normal. On day 10, at the time of discharge, she complained of pain and mild swelling of the right hand, just above the wrist. A USG Doppler showed a 3.7 cm thrombus in the right cephalic vein.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe pathogenesis of COVID-19 is insidiously unfolding. It is now being considered a prothrombotic disease believed to be responsible for venous and arterial thrombosis. Many patients with severe COVID-19 present with coagulation abnormalities that mimic other systemic coagulopathies, but the significance of COVID-19 coagulation abnormalities is becoming increasingly clear as a sizeable proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 develop, sometimes unrecognized, venous and arterial thromboembolic complications.4 It is believed that COVID-19 coagulopathy might be a form of disseminated intravascular coagulation.5 Acute arterial occlusions have been described in the aorta and mesenteric and cerebral arteries.6,7\n\nThe prevalence of thrombosis in COVID-19 is multifactorial: the presence of a raging inflammatory response accompanied by coagulopathy, with raised D-dimer levels, and the frequent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies;8 and a higher risk for complications, such as atrial arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure, myocarditis, and venous thromboses, which contribute to the risk of ischemic stroke.9 Additionally, baseline stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, predispose a patient to infection with COVID-19.\n\nThe most classical feature in patients presenting with thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is an increased D-dimer and a modest thrombocytopenia.10 All our patients had elevated D-dimer levels and developed thrombosis in spite of being on adequate and appropriate anticoagulation, which is concurrent with the observation of others.11 Low platelet count was observed only in the patient with coexisting malaria. It has been reported that about 50% of the patients have increased D-dimer levels, and abnormal D-dimer levels are associated with a poor prognosis.12 The diagnostic value of D-dimer levels for thrombus formation in COVID-19 patients is unclear. Whether higher D-dimer levels in patients with COVID-19 suggest the need for more aggressive anticoagulant therapy is a matter of debate.12 Three of our five patients survived and were discharged after a prolonged stay. Two of our patients succumbed, one due to a stormy pulmonary course and the second due to pulmonary and neurological complications.\n\nMajority of the cases described in the literature had pre-existing comorbidities, which could have contributed to the thrombotic complication.13 However, two of our five patients did not have the traditional risk factors predisposing them to thrombosis or arterial embolisms (Cases 1 and 5) and one was a well-controlled hypertensive (Case 2). In some series, thrombotic manifestations have been described in the elderly, though none of our patients could be categorized as elderly.\n\nMost of the reports have described thrombosis in patients with severe COVID.1,14 In our case series, two patients (Cases 1 and 5) had mild-COVID and did not need supplemental oxygen. In fact, the first patient was probably asymptomatic and was diagnosed as COVID when he presented with a stroke.\n\nAcute ischemia/thrombosis appeared on average 15 days after the onset of respiratory COVID-19 symptoms, in most of the cases reported in the literature.1 In the study of Mao et al., 5.7% of patients with severe infection developed cerebrovascular disease later in the course of illness.13 In our study, patients 2 and 4 had severe respiratory involvement at the time of presentation with the thrombotic complication, though the day of symptom onset was 15\u201320 days earlier.\n\nCRP and ferritin were elevated in all the patients, implying a role of inflammation, which has been increasingly accepted as a contributor to the thrombotic events.15 Elevated levels of CRP and D-dimer, indicating a high inflammatory state and abnormalities with the coagulation cascade, respectively, might play a role in the pathophysiology of stroke in the setting of COVID-19 infection.13\n\nTwo of the patients (Cases 2 and 4) were treated for mild COVID symptoms and developed life-threatening thrombotic complications after discharge. In view of the severe respiratory involvement and the poor general condition of both the patients, intervention could not be offered to them.\n\nIn view of the relative recency of the pandemic and current limited evidence, the role of oral anticoagulation for all patients postdischarge is not clear. In addition, D-dimer levels rise after the second week in many patients, at all levels of severity. Also, at what level of D-dimer should oral anticoagulation be initiated and for how long is a matter of debate. The benefit of short-term oral anticoagulation at the time of discharge, preferably based on predischarge D-dimer levels, needs to be further evaluated.\n\nConclusion\n\nCatastrophic COVID complications, such as acute ischemic stroke and lower limb arterial thrombosis, should be picked up early so that time-sensitive interventions, such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy, can be instituted in order to avoid long-term disability. Stroke teams should be aware of the fact that COVID-19 patients can present with cerebrovascular accidents and use appropriate personal protective equipment in every suspected patient. It is well established that all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should receive prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation. But what needs to be elucidated through trials is the benefit of short-term anticoagulation postdischarge, its duration, and the most appropriate agent for the same.\n\nMeanwhile, unraveling thrombotic mechanisms in COVID- 19 may yield better strategies to prevent disabling thrombotic complications, like ischemic stroke and limb ischemia.\n\nOrcid\n\nMala V Kaneria https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0115-0855\n\nSwaleha Nadaf https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8953-9875\n\nUnnati Desai https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7647-0469\n\nSource of support: Nil\n\nConflict of interest: None",

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nVertebral artery dissection in term pregnancy after cervical spine manipulation: a\u00a0case report and review the\u00a0literature.\n\nABSTRACT:\nBACKGROUND\nVertebral artery dissection is an uncommon, but potentially fatal, vascular event. This case aimed to describe the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of vertebral artery dissection in a term pregnant patient. Moreover, we focused on the differential diagnosis, reviewing the available evidence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 39-year-old Caucasian woman presented at 38\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0weeks of gestation with a short-term history of vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms appeared a few days after cervical spine manipulation by an osteopathic specialist. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the head was obtained and revealed an ischemic lesion of the right posterolateral portion of the brain bulb. A subsequent computed tomography angiographic scan of the head and neck showed a right vertebral artery dissection. Based on the correlation of the neurological manifestations and imaging findings, a diagnosis of vertebral artery dissection was established. The patient started low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and prophylactic enoxaparin following an urgent cesarean section.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVertebral artery dissection is a rare but potential cause of neurologic impairments in pregnancy and during the postpartum period. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis for women who present with headache and/or vertigo. Women with a history of migraines, hypertension, or autoimmune disorders in pregnancy are at higher risk, as well as following cervical spine manipulations. Prompt diagnosis and management of vertebral artery dissection are essential to ensure favorable outcomes.\n\nTEXT:\npmcBackground\n\nVertebral arterial dissection (VAD) is a rare complication of pregnancy and puerperium. A data registry reported that 2.4% of symptomatic, spontaneous VADs occurred in the postpartum period [1]. Aortic, coronary, and cervical/vertebral artery dissection was reported to be associated with preeclampsia in the antenatal setting [1]. On the other hand, VAD incidence in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is unknown, due to the paucity of reports documenting only adverse outcomes [1]. Hormonal and mechanical factors might increase the risk of VAD during pregnancy and puerperium [2]. Indeed, identified predisposing factors of VAD include intimal injury related to Valsalva maneuvers during labor, and alterations in arterial wall integrity due to hormonal or vasoactive substances, in addition to an overall state of hypercoagulability [3]. Another possible condition that can lead to VAD is cervical spine manipulation [4]. It is known that any type of trauma can cause a dissection such as cervical manipulation. Therefore, in nonpregnant patients, it is not uncommon, but most patients are asymptomatic, and this serious accident after manipulation has an underestimated incidence. Nevertheless, the risk related to the development of VAD is decidedly low if the manipulation maneuvers are carried out according to good clinical practice [4]. Several vascular and connective tissue disorders have also been associated with dissection; in particular, migraines, fibromuscular hyperplasia, and vascular Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome [5]. As previously stated, the etiology of VAD is complex and often multifactorial, especially when trivial trauma and manipulations are involved. Other risk factors or conditions, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, Marfan\u2019s syndrome, migraines, use of oral contraceptives, recent infections, and mild hyperhomocysteinemia, should be considered in any given case [6]. There exists uncertainty of how to counsel women with a previous VAD, regarding the risk of recurrence during pregnancy [2].\n\nWe aim to describe a 39-year-old female who presented with vertigo, nausea, and vomiting and was found to have a VAD. We discuss the presentation, differential diagnosis, and pathogenesis of this uncommon, but clinically significant, vascular event. Finally, we briefly review other described VAD cases.\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 39-year-old pregnant Caucasian woman presented to the Obstetric Emergency Room reporting vertigo, vomiting, nystagmus, dizziness, and hindrance in the execution of fine movements of the right arm. The maternal parameters on admission are regular: pulse 98\u00a0beats per minute, pressure 110/68\u00a0mmHg, and temperature of 36.2\u00a0\u00b0C. She had an obstetric history of a first-trimester spontaneous abortion and a medical history of tension headache. She is married and graduated. She has a high socioeconomic status and is employed as an engineer.\n\nThe ongoing pregnancy coursed physiologically until that moment. The fetus was screened for aneuploidy with a noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT), while second- and third-trimester ultrasounds for the study of malformations were both normal. The oral glucose tolerance test at 24\u00a0weeks was negative. At 38\u00a0+\u00a04-week gestation, the patient was hospitalized due to suspected vestibular neuritis diagnosed by an otolaryngology (ORL) specialist. Following diagnosis, the patient started therapy with corticosteroids, including prednisone 5\u00a0mg two times per day and levosulpiride 25\u00a0mg two times per day, that continued for 3\u00a0days.\n\nOn day 2, the patient developed diplopia and worsening of vomiting and dizziness, with improvement of symptoms in left lateral decubitus. The ORL revaluation excluded peripheral vestibulopathy and progressed to an urgent brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast that excluded ischemic or hemorrhagic brain lesions.\n\nOn day 3, due to further worsening of symptoms, urgent neurological counseling was performed. Viral examinations of herpes simplex I and II, herpes zoster, and herpes virus VI were negative. The neurologic examination showed the left eye adducted and elevated, vertical diplopia, and presence of rotatory nystagmus accentuated on the right gaze and dyssynergia in the cerebellar maneuvers of the right upper limb. After a detailed medical history, the patient stated for the first time that she had undergone cervical spine manipulations by an osteopathic specialist in the days preceding the beginning of the symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was urgently performed, showing a punctate lesion hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Fig. 1A\u2013B), characterized by a reduction of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on the colorimetric maps. This finding was suggestive of ischemia in the posterolateral right medulla oblongata, which is consistent with the symptoms of Wallenberg syndrome, although the patient did not have the full spectrum of symptoms. On MR angiography, the intracranial V4 segment was normal, but the right posteroinferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was not present (Fig. 1E). Urgent thrombolytic therapy or emergency revascularization was not deemed necessary by the neurologist colleague. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), 100\u00a0mg, therapy was then prescribed. Subsequently, echo-color Doppler ultrasound of the supra-aortic trunk detected no alterations of the cervical vessels, and transthoracic echocardiogram with exclusion of patency of the foramen ovale was performed. During this observation period, the patient was continuously monitored with noninvasive blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter to detect hypotensive state and/or desaturation episodes early. Considering the clinical condition of the patient, the term gestational age, and initial onset of prodromal contractions, an elective cesarean section (CS) under subarachnoid anesthesia was performed, given the inability of the patient to deliver vaginally because of the ischemic cerebral event and obligatory left lateral decubitus, diplopia, and dizziness. The intraoperative and postoperative courses were uneventful. Six hours after the CS, prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin was prescribed.Fig. 1 Right vertebral artery dissection with ischemia in the posterolateral medulla oblongata. In DWI (a) and ADC map (b) the arrow shows a punctate, shiny ischemic lesion, with typical reduction of ADC in the right posterolateral medulla oblongata. c and d CT angiography (axial and 3D reformat, c and d, respectively) showing a focal dissection of the V2 distal segment of the right vertebral artery, with the arrow in figure c pointing to the dissection. e MRI angiography (time of flight, TOF) showing the absence of visualization of right PICA\n\nThe neonate showed good adaptation to postnatal life with an Apgar score of 9 at 1\u2032, 10 at 5\u2032, and 10 at 10\u2032; blood gas analysis was regular both in the artery and vein. Normal anthropometric parameters were present: 3250\u00a0g (52nd centile), length of 49\u00a0cm, and cranial circumference of 36\u00a0cm.\n\nOn day 4, for better study suspected dissection on small vertebral vessels, the patient underwent CT angiography of the neck, which showed a focal dissection at the V2 distal segment of the right vertebral artery (Fig. 1C\u2013D). The puerperium course was normal, and the midwife helped the patient during breastfeeding because of the difficulty of standing up and walking due to the diplopic symptom. Psychological support was offered during the hospitalization, with daily physiotherapy rehabilitation and orthoptic evaluation. Congenital and acquired thrombophilia tested negative. After 12\u00a0days of rehabilitation, the patient was discharged with continued complaints of diplopia and a walker for mobility. After the VAD diagnosis and for the entire length of hospitalization, the patient was treated with Cardioaspirin 100\u00a0mg/day and prophylactic enoxaparin 4000 UI/day subcutaneous injection for 60\u00a0days. At the subsequent neurological evaluation, during the follow-up of 2 and 4\u00a0months, the patient showed persistence of vertical diplopia and a circumspect and wide gait, and life-long ASA was prescribed. A follow-up MRI was scheduled for 6\u00a0months after the stroke, which confirmed the signs of the previous ischemic lesion on the posterolateral right medulla oblongata. The remaining findings are unchanged.\n\nEthical approval was obtained, and the patient gave written informed consent to publish this case and any accompanying images.\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is one of the rare reports of an ischemic lesion due to VAD in low-risk pregnancy secondary to cervical spine manipulation. Cervical artery dissection (CAD), including VAD, is a rare complication of pregnancy; however, Salehi Omran et\u00a0al. recently demonstrated that the incidence in pregnancy is twice as common as in the rest of the female population [7]. VAD has typically been associated with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) [1, 8], autoimmune disease [9], and migraines [10]. A recent nationwide American cohort study on pregnancy-associated arterial dissection showed that VAD is the fourth most common dissection after or prior birth and found a significant association with older maternal age, chronic hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, alcohol use, obesity, heart failure, chronic liver disease, arthritis, depression, Marfan syndrome, and Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome [11]. However, one recent meta-analysis demonstrated that nearly 50% of cases occur in the absence of such risk factors [12, 13]. To date, the etiology of VAD is not well established. Borelli et\u00a0al. proposed a dual mechanism of pathogenesis occurring in the postpartum period: (1) advanced age, causing increased arterial stiffness, and (2) hormone fluctuations, inducing structural vascular changes [14], which may also happen at the end of pregnancy in our patient. McKinney et\u00a0al. also suggested that endothelial damage may occur due to the release of vasoactive or angiogenic substances during pregnancy [15].\n\nVAD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of women who present with nonspecific symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, and/or vertigo, particularly in the context of HDP [1]. Women older than 35\u00a0years and those with a history of HDP or autoimmune disease (that is, systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-phospholipid syndrome) are particularly at high risk. Other predisposing factors of arterial dissection in the peripartum period include intimal injury related to Valsalva maneuvers during labor, alterations in arterial wall integrity due to pregnancy-related hormonal or vasoactive substances [9], and reactive thrombocytosis (subsequent to postpartum hemorrhage), which may all play potential roles in this process and require further investigation [16]. Moreover, prompt diagnosis and management of VAD are essential to ensure favorable patient outcomes.\n\nOne recent report discussed the contributing factors in a case of VAD following chiropractic treatment in a pregnant woman with systemic lupus erythematosus [4]. Migraine disorder was shown to be associated with a twofold increased risk of VAD in a recent meta-analysis [9] and has been frequently reported in several case series [17\u201319]. Stuber et\u00a0al. recently published a review of the literature regarding adverse effects of spinal manipulation in the pregnant and postpartum periods [20], identifying adverse events in five pregnant women and two postpartum women.\n\nTable 1 summarizes all cases of VAD reported both prior and after delivery, with 24 cases distributed with a prevalence during the postpartum period (19 of the 24 cases). The clinical presentation is varied, with a higher frequency of headaches, vertigo, and diplopia, and the risk factors most represented are hypertension and migraines.Table 1 Review of literature: cases of vertebral artery dissection VAD reported in pregnancy and postpartum period\n\nCases\tAge\tPresentation\tRisk factors\tVAD affected\tMode of delivery\tTime to and from delivery (days)\t\nCurrent report\t39\tVertigo, vomiting, nystagmus, dizziness, and hindrance in the execution of fine movements with the right arm\tMigraine\tRight\tCesarean section\tAntepartum, 39 w\t\nGasecki et\u00a0al.

CAD is thought to occur spontaneously, but neck trauma, especially in hyperextension and rotation, has been reported as a trigger [23]. A population-based, case\u2013control study found no evidence of excess risk of vertebrobasilar stroke associated with chiropractic care compared with controls [24]. A recent retrospective case\u2013control study, however, found a significantly increased risk of VAD in individuals less than 55\u00a0years of age with recent neck manual therapy [25]. A recent multivariable regression analysis of a retrospective study assessed the risk factors and clinical outcomes associated with CAD-related strokes. Patients with CAD were younger and more likely to have a history of migraines and recent neck manipulation [26]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of chiropractic care and CAD concluded that the quality of the published data was very low, and the authors showed a small association between chiropractic neck manipulation and CAD [27, 28].\n\nFinally, the future of these women is somewhat debated. They should be advised about their increased risk of developing a new stroke, so these patients will need to continue Cardioaspirin prophylaxis for life [2]. Regarding reproductive future, a recent observational German study concluded that the risk of recurrent VAD may not be significantly increased with pregnancies, starting at least 12\u00a0months after the event, in women without connective tissue disease, such as our patient [2].\n\nDespite the absence of hypertension and autoimmune diseases in our patient, previous chiropractic treatment, pregnancy hormonal condition, and advanced age (39\u00a0years) may have contributed to vessel fragility. The risk of VAD was also increased due to the history of tensive headache/migraine. Osteopathy practitioners should be aware of the possible complications of neck manipulation in pregnancy and the postpartum period, particularly in mothers with underlying medical disorders that may predispose to vessel fragility and VAD.\n\nIn conclusion, we recommend that obstetric professionals carefully consider VAD as a differential diagnosis when evaluating women with dizziness, headache, and neck pain with or without a recent history of spinal manipulation, both in pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Moreover, they should consider with caution the risks and benefits of any cervical osteopathy practice in pregnant women with risk factors for VAD (hypertension and autoimmune diseases, history of tensive headache/migraine).\n\nAbbreviations\n\nVAD Vertebral artery dissection\n\nCAD Cervical artery dissection\n\nNIPT Noninvasive prenatal test\n\nORL Otolaryngologist\n\nCT Computed tomography\n\nMRI Magnetic resonance imaging\n\nASA Acetylsalicylic acid\n\nCS Cesarean section\n\nHDP Hypertensive disorder of pregnancy\n\nDWI Diffusion-weighted imaging\n\nADC Apparent diffusion coefficient\n\nPICA Posteroinferior cerebellar artery\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nNot applicable.\n\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\n\nFM and SB contributed to the clinical management of the patient and the literature review, and wrote the initial draft of this manuscript and subsequent revisions.

Examination demonstrated bilateral optic nerve edema, a right sixth cranial nerve palsy, along with characteristic features of markedly elevated intracranial pressure on imaging. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was 60 cmH2O. Cessation of topical tretinoin use ensued complete resolution of symptoms and optic nerve swelling in both eyes.\nOur findings substantiate the need to avoid topical vitamin A derivatives and alternate drug classes known to be associated with drug-induced intracranial hypertension.\n\nTEXT:\n1 Introduction\n\nVitamin A derivatives and tetracycline-class antibiotics are among known medications associated with drug-induced intracranial hypertension (DIIH). Presenting symptoms including headaches, transient visual obscurations, and compressive optic neuropathy leading to irreversible severe visual impairment are well-documented.1 There remains a paucity of data regarding topical tretinoin and its association with secondary intracranial hypertension. Thought to be a safer option than systemic isotretinoin, topical tretinoin, or all-trans-retinoic acid, is an active intracellular metabolite of isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) often prescribed as a first-line treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris.2 There have been two previous reports of topical formulations of vitamin A linked to intracranial hypertension.3,4 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of cross-reactivity with topical tretinoin use and alternate drug classes associated with DIIH. We report the first case of secondary intracranial hypertension associated with topical tretinoin in a patient with a remote history of tetracycline-induced intracranial hypertension.\n\n2 Case\n\nA 19-year old woman (BMI of 31.1) with a remote history of secondary intracranial hypertension due to minocycline use presented with headaches and worsening vision. Three years after minocycline cessation and confirmed resolution of elevated intracranial pressure, the patient was started on topical tretinoin. One year later, she developed headaches, nausea, visual obscurations, and a right sixth cranial nerve palsy. Fundus examination revealed bilateral optic nerve edema (Fig. 1A).

A recent systematic review proposed a set of diagnostic criteria for DIIH, elucidating that vitamin A derivatives and tetracycline-class antibiotics are among the highest-risk category.1 They are both category V medications (medications found to be most strongly associated with DIIH)1 and may even have a synergistic effect on inducing DIIH.6 Studies have demonstrated that tetracyclines should not be prescribed concurrently with isotretinoin, and a drug-free period of at least seven days is recommended to achieve theoretical drug clearance.2,9,10 Despite these recommendations, cases of drug-induced intracranial hypertension preceded by concomitant use of tetracycline and isotretinoin exist.\n\nAlthough topical formulations of vitamin A have rarely been linked to intracranial hypertension,3,4 its relationship with alternate drug classes has never been reported. Additionally, while it is rare for topical tretinoin to have substantial systemic absorption and subsequently have adverse systemic effects, this must always be a consideration. Our patient had a remote, resolved history of DIIH secondary to minocycline use and developed intracranial hypertension whilst using topical tretinoin only, many years later. Because there are only a couple of reported cases of DIIH with topical vitamin A derivatives, patients with secondary intracranial hypertension have been prescribed such medications from alternate drug classes. The exact mechanism by which tretinoin and tetracycline-class antibiotic induce intracranial hypertension is unclear. Current hypotheses include that tetracyclines may impede CSF outflow at the arachnoid villi while oral retinoids may be directly toxic to arachnoid villi function.5,6 Our case report is in stark contrast to the proposal that patients who have suffered DIIH with one class of medication can safely be treated with alternate medication classes.5,7,8 We highlight the need to carefully consider use of medications known to cause DIIH in patients who have experienced DIIH in the past. Based on our findings, alternate classes of drugs that are independently known to cause IIH should be approached with caution and vigilant surveillance, as there may be a similar undiscovered mechanism of causation.\n\nThe results of our report not only substantiate the need to avoid use of alternate drug classes known to cause DIIH in those with a history of intracranial hypertension, but also demonstrate a potential cross-reactivity between two classes of drugs that needs to be further elucidated. Our findings will assist physicians with proper counseling and decision-making when prescribing such medications. To improve patient safety and decrease the risk of potentially irreversible vision loss, patients taking these medications should receive routine ophthalmologic examination.\n\nPatient consent\n\nConsent to publish this case report was not obtained as this report does not contain any identifiable personal information.\n\nAuthorship\n\nAll authors attest that they meet the ICMJE criteria for Authorship.\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n\nThe following authors have no financial disclosures: SG, XG, EH.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nNone.",

Herein we describe the first case of IIH in an adolescent transgender patient.\nA 17-year-old non-obese female-to-male transgender patient on subcutaneous testosterone since age 13 presented with a two-month history of transient visual obscuration and frontal headaches. Ophthalmological examination revealed Frisen grade 2 papilledema with preserved visual function. Lumbar puncture confirmed elevated opening pressure. Papilledema resolved with oral acetazolamide and reduction of testosterone therapy.\nThe use of cross-sex hormone therapy (CSH) for gender affirmation may increase the risk of IIH. Awareness of this association is important as the number of younger transgender patients seeking CSH is increasing significantly.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1 Introduction\n\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in adults is strongly associated with obesity and its incidence is four times higher in women than in men, at 7.7 versus 1.6 per 100,000, respectively.1 The etiology of IIH is unknown and likely multifactorial. Even though the role of sex hormones in the pathophysiology of IIH is not completely understood, androgen excess in women is associated with IIH.2 Specifically, women with IIH have increased serum testosterone and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testosterone and androstenedione. This pattern of androgen excess differs from the one seen in isolated obesity or obesity related to polycystic ovary syndrome, which shares many features with IIH,3 suggesting that androgen excess may be an independent risk factor for IIH. Cross-sex hormone therapy (CSH), estrogen for transgender women and testosterone for transgender men, is used for gender affirmation. IIH has been reported in at least 16 adult transgender patients treated with CSH (Table 1),4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 whereas no cases have been reported in younger patients. Herein we describe the case of an adolescent who developed IIH while being treated with testosterone for a female-to-male (FTM) transition.Table 1 Reported cases in the literature of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in transgender patients.\n\nTable 1Case\tAge\tGender\tBMI\tHormone tx\tSymptoms start\tTreatment of IIH\tEvolution\t\n1 (12)\t28\tMTF\t30.13\tEstrogens, spironolactone\t8\u00a0M post-tx start\tHold estrogen; change to sublingual estrogen\u00a0+\u00a0DMX 1 g/day\tResolved at 5\u00a0M\t\n2 (12)\t31\tFTM\t56.5\tTestosterone\t1Y post-tx cessation\tDMX 1 g/day\u00a0+\u00a0resume testosterone\tResolved at 6\u00a0M\t\n3 (5)\t22\tFTM\t27.91\tTestosterone, progestin\tRapid onset post-tx start\tShunt\tResolved at 18\u00a0M\t\n4 (6)\t36\tFTM\t25.0\tTestosterone\t50\u00a0M post-tx start\tDMX 1 g/day \u2192 1.5 g/day, furosemide 20 mg/day, topiramate 25 mg/day, endovascular stent\tResolved at 1\u00a0M; atrophy without edema at 6\u00a0M\t\n5 (7)\t23\tFTM\t27.05\tTestosterone\t2W post-tx start\tDMX 0.5 g/day\u00a0+\u00a050% decrease testosterone\tResolved at 5\u00a0M\t\n6 (8)\t22\tFTM\t<30\tTestosterone\t3W post-tx start\tDMX 1 g/day with taper\u00a0+\u00a0change to long-action testosterone\tResolved\t\n7 (9)\t33\tFTM\tNA\tTestosterone\t<10\u00a0M post-tx cessation\tDMX 1.5 g/day \u2192 furosemide 80 mg/day, topiramate 150 mg/day; fenestration OD\tImproved at 1\u00a0M\t\n8 (10)\t39\tMTF\t>40\tEstrogens, spironolactone\t3-5Y post-tx cessation\tDMX 2 g/day\u00a0+\u00a0fenestration OD\tImproved subjectively at 1D, lost to follow-up\t\n9 (11)\t34\tMTF\t41.9\tEstrogens, progestin\t2.5Y post-tx start; 1\u00a0M post-op\tDMX 1 g/day \u2192 2 g/day \u2192 2.5 g/day, topiramate 50 mg/day, therapeutic LP, fenestration OS\tNo symptoms at 2W; resolved\u00a0+\u00a050 lbs loss at 2\u00a0M\t\n10 (4)\t24\tFTM\tNA\tNA\tNA\tDMX 1 g/day\u00a0+\u00a050% decrease testosterone\tResolved\u00a0+\u00a0increase testosterone at 2\u00a0M\t\n11 (13)\t23\tFTM\t29.1\tTestosterone\t11\u00a0M post-tx start\tDMX 500 mg/day\tImprovement at 5\u00a0M\t\n12 (13)\t29\tFTM\t35.0\tTestosterone\t19\u00a0M post-tx start\tDMX 325 mg/day\u00a0+\u00a0topiramate\tPersistence at 2\u00a0M\t\n13 (13)\t19\tFTM\t31.9\tTestosterone\t2Y tx, many months of symptoms\tTopiramate\tImprovement at 6\u00a0M\t\n14 (13)\t22\tFTM\t36.1\tTestosterone\t13\u00a0M post-tx start\tDMX\tWorsened at 1\u00a0M, lost to follow-up\t\n15 (13)\t23\tFTM\t44.0\tTestosterone\t15\u00a0M post-tx start\tDMX 1 g/day\u00a0+\u00a0nortriptyline 75 mg/day\tImproved over 2Y\t\n16 (13)\t25\tMTF\tNA\tEstrogens\tNo symptoms, referral after 4Y tx\tNone\tStable at 3\u00a0M and 1Y\t\nFTM\u00a0=\u00a0female-to-male transition, MTF\u00a0=\u00a0male-to-female transition, BMI\u00a0=\u00a0body mass index, tx\u00a0=\u00a0therapy, g\u00a0=\u00a0grams, mg\u00a0=\u00a0milligrams, lbs\u00a0=\u00a0pounds, OU\u00a0=\u00a0oculus uterque, OD\u00a0=\u00a0oculus dextrus, OS\u00a0=\u00a0oculus sinister, DMX\u00a0=\u00a0acetazolamide, D\u00a0=\u00a0day, M\u00a0=\u00a0months, Y\u00a0=\u00a0years, NA\u00a0=\u00a0not available/unknown.\n\n2 Case report\n\nA 17-year-old non-obese female-to-male (FTM) transgender patient was referred to the pediatric neuro-ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of possible IIH because of a two-month history of transient visual obscurations and frequent generalised and frontal headaches that worsened with physical activity. He had no diplopia, tinnitus, nausea, or other symptoms of intracranial hypertension. He had undergone mastectomy at a younger age and had been treated with subcutaneous testosterone injections since age 13, which resulted in adequate masculinisation. His testosterone dose had been adjusted for age gradually, and 1 month before our exam it had been increased to 70 mg per week. The patient's body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2, and he denied any recent weight gain. He was on no other medication. Ophthalmological examination revealed visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes and normal color vision on Hardy-Rand-Rittler (HRR) plate test. The pupils reacted normally to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) and there was no sixth nerve palsy. The anterior segments looked normal on the slit lamp and fundoscopy revealed bilateral Frisen grade 2 papilledema. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed thickening of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (116 \u03bcm OD and 184 \u03bcm OS) and Humphrey 24-2 visual fields were normal. A head computed tomography (CT) and angio-CT were also normal. A lumbar puncture confirmed elevated opening intracranial pressure (37.5 cm of water). The patient was diagnosed with IIH and started on oral acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily. Endocrinology was involved for management of hormone therapy. Testosterone was withheld the week of initial presentation and was subsequently tapered to 50 mg weekly. The headaches and optic nerve swelling improved progressively, allowing for cessation of acetazolamide 3.5 months later. On last follow-up, 10 months after initial presentation, the patient continued to receive 50 mg of testosterone per week and remained asymptomatic with no recurrence of papilledema.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nIn recent years, the number of transgender adolescents seeking endocrine care has increased significantly. This is paralleled with societal acceptance of gender diversity14 and the ample evidence that gender-affirmation treatment improves the mental health of patients with gender dysphoria, or distress caused by the incongruence between gender identity and gender assigned at birth.15, 16, 17\n\nOur patient developed IIH while being treated with testosterone for FTM transition, like 70% of reported adults who developed IIH while undergoing affirming therapy (Table 1: cases 2\u20137, 10\u201315).4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,12,13 His IIH symptoms manifested 4 years after beginning testosterone treatment, which is in keeping with a widely variable duration between start of hormone therapy and onset of IIH symptoms in previously published adult cases, between a few weeks and 5 years (Table 1).4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Of the previously reported adult cases, 8 were obese (Table 1: cases 1, 2, 8, 9, 12\u201315).10, 11, 12, 13 Our patient was not obese but was overweight. Even though androgen excess seems to contribute to IIH independently from obesity,3 the latter remains an important confounding factor when analyzing the role of CSH in transgender patients with IIH.18\n\nThe exact role of testosterone in the development of IIH is unknown. However, given that men with androgen deficiency may have a higher risk of developing IIH, it has been proposed that IIH occurs at a level of circulating serum testosterone shared by women with androgen excess and men with androgen deficiency.18 The presence of androgen receptors in the choroid plexus has been demonstrated in animal models.19 Stimulation of those receptors by excess testosterone would result in increased CSF secretion in IIH.2,3,20 Reflecting a trend that is likely to continue in years to come, monthly referrals to a pediatric transgender clinic in Northern California increased by over 500% between 2015 and 2018.21 Awareness and reporting of the possible causal association between CSH and IIH, a potentially blinding condition, are important in view of the increasing number of young transgender patients seeking hormone-affirmation therapy.\n\nPatient consent\n\nWritten informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient's legal guardian.\n\nFunding\n\nNo funding or grant support.\n\nAuthorship\n\nAll authors attest that they meet the current ICMJE criteria for Authorship.\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n\nThe following authors have no financial disclosures: T.N., M.H., and L.H.O.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nNone.",

The patient could not express if he was in pain. The initial diagnosis from the emergency room was bacterial keratitis, confirmed with a positive pseudomonas culture. However, upon examination by the ophthalmologist it was noted that there was not only a large, infected epithelial defect, but also an intraocular pressure of 35 and a candy-cane hypopyon. The diagnosis of herpes neurotrophic keratitis and iridocyclitis was made and the patient was started on intravenous acyclovir along with the appropriate topical medications. A day later, it was noted that the patient developed a right sided facial palsy and vesicular lesions inside the right ear canal, as confirmed by otolaryngology.\nRamsay-Hunt Syndrome is usually known to the ophthalmologist due to the exposure keratopathy caused by facial palsy. This case demonstrates varicella-zoster virus (VZV) neurotrophic keratitis preceding the development of facial palsy, which can further exacerbate an already neurotrophic cornea. The practitioner should be aware of these signs and symptoms and adjust their treatment with systemic acyclovir-prednisone.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1 Introduction\n\nVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation in the geniculate ganglion, and involvement of the sensory nerves innervating the ear, defines herpes zoster oticus.1 When associated with facial paralysis, it is known as Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome (RHS), which includes ear pain and vesicular lesions in the ear.1 Due to the proximity of the facial nerve fascicles to the VIIIth nerve in the bony facial canal, these 2 cranial nerves are commonly co-involved characterized by not only facial paralysis and painful vesicular lesions in the ear canal, but also hearing loss.1 However, poly-cranial-neuropathy has been reported in many cases of RHS due to VZV causing ascending inflammation along the brainstem between several cranial nerve nuclei and dorsal root ganglia. It is also hypothesized that VZV can travel along brainstem reflexes which would allow it to travel to multiple cranial nerves during reactivation.2, 3, 4 RHS is usually known to the ophthalmologist due to the paralytic ectropion and exposure keratopathy caused by facial nerve palsy; it is the second most common cause of facial nerve paralysis behind Bell's palsy.4\n\nCranial nerve V is one of the more commonly co-affected cranial nerves in RHS.2, 3, 4 Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) with necrotizing retinitis, neurotrophic keratitis, and exposure keratitis have all been reported following the RHS presentation, usually along with vesicular lesions in the V1\u2013V3 dermatomes.5,6 Our case is the first known case of neurotrophic keratitis and iridocyclitis, which are common sequela of herpes zoster reactivation in the eye, with facial palsy and vesicular lesions in the ear canal occurring subsequently. This would suggest that VZV reactivation in the trigeminal ganglion can also descend to the geniculate ganglion and cause RHS.\n\n2 Case report\n\nA 69-year-old bedbound male with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 7.3%), end-stage renal disease on dialysis, vascular dementia, and chronic pressure ulcers presented to the emergency room for a red right eye along with tearing and mucous production. The patient was unable to provide a history or express if he was in pain due to his mental status. The initial diagnosis in the emergency room was bacterial keratitis and a culture was taken by the emergency room physician, followed by admission for around-the-clock topical antibiotics. The patient was started on moxifloxacin and tobramycin drops alternating every 2 hours. The patient was seen by ophthalmology the next day and the right eye was found to have an intraocular pressure of 35, a large central neurotrophic epithelial defect with a stromal infiltrate, and a 1mm hypopyon and hyphema, also known as a candy-cane hypopyon Fig. 1. There was good eyelid blink and closure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown in culture susceptible to the current antibiotics. The diagnosis of herpes keratitis and iridocyclitis was made and the patient was promptly started on intravenous acyclovir along with topical IOP lowering drops and cycloplegics. Given the patient's physical condition, it was decided not to bring him to the operating room for an anterior chamber paracentesis for viral cultures and PCR. Moreover, the clinical signs highly suggested a viral pathology and that the bacterial infiltrate was a super-infection. The next day, the stromal infiltrate was noted to be coalesced and more superficial, so topical prednisolone was added, antibiotic drop frequency was reduced and tobramycin drops was switched to tobramycin ointment. At this time, it was noted that the patient developed a right-sided lower facial palsy and vesicular lesions inside the right ear canal, as confirmed by otolaryngology examination Fig. 2, Fig. 3. The diagnosis of VZV Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome was made and 60mg intravenous prednisone was added, dosed as a weekly taper of 10mg. The patient developed a right lateral lower lid paralytic ectropion, but still had good lid closure and ointment coverage, so a tarsorrhaphy was not performed. The facial palsy improved within 2 days of initiation of intravenous prednisone, along with improvement of the right intraocular pressure, corneal infiltrate, epithelial defect and hypopyon. The prompt response to the anti-viral and steroid medication further suggested that the patient's condition was viral in origin. The patient was discharged on tapering oral prednisone, topical prednisolone and tobramycin ointment.Fig. 1 External photograph of the right eye.

Cranial nerves VII and VIII are most commonly co-involved due to close proximity of the geniculate ganglion to the VIIIth nerve within the bony facial canal.1 There are several hypotheses describing the ability of VZV to affect multiple cranial nerves simultaneously: several cranial and dorsal root ganglia comprise a chain in which inflammation of a single ganglion could extend to nearby ganglia in the brainstem (ganglionitis), namely cranial nerves V, IX, X, XI, XII. It is also hypothesized that all cranial nerves involved in RHS are connected by pathways of important brainstem reflexes, which would allow VZV to spread along these pathways causing multiple cranial nerves to be involved.2, 3, 4 This case is the first of our knowledge to have a polyneuropathy involving cranial nerve V first, presenting as neurotrophic ulcer and iridocyclitis, followed by the more classic cranial nerve VII involvement. Acyclovir-prednisone administration is generally accepted as the standard of care in improving facial nerve palsy and reducing cranial nerve inflammation, however some studies with acyclovir alone are equivocal.1,7,8\n\nThe facial palsy invariably can cause lower lid paralytic ectropion and exposure keratopathy. Previous case reports have been presented with CN V and VII co-involvement presenting as neurotrophic keratitis and necrotizing retinitis, with RHS as the primary presentation. The patient with neurotrophic keratitis initially presented to the otolaryngologist and was diagnosed with RHS. The patient subsequently developed vesicular lesions along V1 and V2, followed by a painful, red eye and was diagnosed with neurotrophic keratitis. The authors hypothesized that VZV laid dormant in both the trigeminal and geniculate ganglia and reactivated simultaneously.5 Another patient was described to have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and developed left-sided hearing loss, vesicular lesions in the left V3 distribution and necrotizing herpetic retinopathy of the left eye. Several days later, the patient developed contralateral signs of VZV; right-sided hearing loss and necrotizing retinitis of the right eye. MRI confirmed neuritis in bilateral CN VIII. The authors concluded that the ophthalmologist should monitor the fundus for retinitis in patients with RHS.6 Lastly, a patient was reported to have sequential RHS, HZO and disseminated-cutaneous herpes zoster, which more commonly happens in immunocompromised patients, but can rarely occur in immunocompetent. The authors suggested a similar mechanism as with our patient, that the affected sensory nerves can affect adjacent cranial nerves through anastomoses in the brainstem and even the spinal ganglia.9\n\nOur case differs from the others from our literature search as RHS is typically the presenting manifestation of VZV. Our patient is the first known case where CN V was involved initially and the patient developed neurotrophic keratitis and iridocyclitis, which is a typical presentation of CN V VZV, with a subsequent development of RHS. Our hypothesis of this presentation coincides with what was described previously: reactivation of VZV in one ganglion can either cause ganglionitis among neighboring ganglia or that the virus traveled to the geniculate ganglion via brainstem pathways. The practitioner should be aware that facial palsy can develop with VZV reactivation and can exacerbate an already neurotrophic cornea.\n\nPatient consent\n\nPermission for photographs was obtained by the patient's next-of-kin.\n\nFunding\n\nNo funding was received for this work.\n\nIntellectual property\n\nWe confirm that we have given due consideration to the protection of intellectual property associated with this work and that there are no impediments to publication, including the timing of publication, with respect to intellectual property.

Trichosporon asahii (T. asahii) is an emerging highly resistant pathogen with considerable mortality particularly in critically ill patients and immunocompromised individuals. We describe a case of a 58-year-old patient who developed T. asahii fungemia after using immunosuppressant agents for his severe COVID-19 related cytokines release syndrome. Pseudohyphae, arthroconidia, and lateral blastoconidia were seen in the stain, and later confirmed to be T. asahii. Voriconazole successfully treated this multi-drug-resistant fungal infection. The clinical presentation, assessment, and management are reviewed to raise awareness of the circumstances leading to coinfection with this emerging resistant yeast.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nTrichosporon is a non-Candida, environmental yeast-like basidiomycete, an emerging fatal opportunistic fungal infection that predominantly occurs in immunocompromised individuals, particularly in hematological malignancies [1]. Trichosporon asahii is the most common fungus in this genus and causes considerable mortality [2]. Other risk factors for invasive trichosporonosis are antibiotic use, AIDS, use of corticosteroids, long ICU stay, presence of central venous catheters (CVC), and invasive medical equipment [1]. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of catastrophic immunological storms in patients with severe COVID-19 illnesses have promoted the use of various therapeutic interventions including immunosuppressive therapy [3], [4]. Thus, provoking the emergence of latent and opportunistic coinfections including multidrug-resistant organisms and fungal infections [5]. Timely identification of Trichosporon fungemia and early Voriconazole use is crucial to avoid ominous outcomes [1].\n\nTo highlight this, we describe a case of Trichosporon asahii fungemia in a critically ill COVID-19 patient discussing relevant associated risks leading to the event and aiming to raise awareness regarding the circumstances and the emergence of this multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogen during the COVID-19 pandemic and review the literature for similar cases.\n\nCase description\n\nA 58-Year-old man with well-controlled diabetes and hypertension presented to our emergency department with symptoms of fever, cough, and progressive shortness of breath for 3 days. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates, and the diagnosis was subsequently confirmed as COVID-19 pneumonia by a positive SARS-Cov2 PCR. Shortly after admission, the patient deteriorated, and laboratory tests showed white blood cells of 3.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L (4\u201311.0) with profound lymphopenia at 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L (1\u20133), thrombocytopenia 30\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L (150\u2013400), elevated inflammatory markers, including CRP 120 (0\u22125\u2009mg/L), IL6 120\u2009pg/mL (normal < 8) and ferritin 990\u2009u/L (30\u2212553). His renal functions were within the normal limit, but d-dimer was 3.25\u2009mg/L (0\u22120.44) and APTT prolonged to 54.3\u2009s (9.7\u201311.8). He progressed to ARDS, clinically assessed as COVID-19 related Cytokine Storm (CCS). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the oxygenation was maintained with continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) and eventually intubated. He was treated with steroids as well as an IL-6 inhibitor, Tocilizumab (total dose of 1200\u2009mg, in two separate doses) in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotics, piperacillin-tazobactam, and Favipiravir as per local hospital policy with a remarkable dropping in the inflammatory markers. However, on day 11 of hospital admission, the patient developed fever with obvious sources of infection. Laboratory findings revealed a white cell count of 21.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L (4\u201311.0) with 88 % neutrophils and a C-reactive level of 305 (0\u22125 5). Shortly after, yeast-like fungus was identified in the blood. Lactophenol cotton blue stain demonstrated pseudohyphae, arthroconidia, and lateral blastoconidia (Fig. 1 A and B). Subsequently, the mass spectrometry assisted by flight time desorption/ionization matrix (MALDI TOF-MS, Billerica, MA, USA) identified the yeast as T. asahii. CVC was removed and intravenous Voriconazole 6\u2009mg/kg/ twice daily for two doses, then 4\u2009mg/kg twice daily for two weeks with rapid clinical response and negative repeated culture. Isolated Trichosporon asahii proved to be sensitive to Voriconazole only and resistant to all other agents. The patient was extubated successfully on day 24 and discharged uneventfully from the hospital.Fig. 1 A: Colony of T. asahii on Sabouraud\u2019s dextrose agar after 48\u2009h incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C. B: Microscopic features of T. asahii with pseudohyphae (green arrow), arthroconidia (yellow arrow) and lateral blastoconidia (red arrow), (Lactophenol Cotton Blue stain, \u00d7100).\n\nFig. 1\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrichosporon spp are yeast-like fungi that are present in the natural flora of the human body; however, they can become pathogenic with a wide spectrum of infections, ranging from superficial white piedra in immunocompetent individuals to fungemia and other invasive trichosporonosis in the immunocompromised host [2]. T. asahii is the most commonly identified pathogen in the genus with more than 70 % reported mortality in invasive trichosporonosis [1]. The 30-day mortality of COVID-19 related T. asahii fungemia was 80 % despite Voriconazole therapy [6]. With the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, increasing concerns about invasive fungal infections have been reported particularly with increased evidence in using steroids and Tocilizumab [5], [7]. Hence, a periodically fungal surveillance approach is recommended in critically ill COVID-19 patients [7]. Of note, patients with critical COVID-19 disease pose many risk factors for acquiring T. asahii fungemia as in our patient [1], [3]. The fact that T. asahii fungemia was grown from the CVC and not from the peripheral line might support that the CVS was the port of entry. In addition, T. asahii has a high ability to colonize the skin and the environment, including medical devices, leading to significant mortality and devise loss [8].\n\nThe matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) TOF MS demonstrates the ability to identify clinical Trichosporon isolates at the species level [9]. The management of T. asahii fungemia is challenging and difficult to treat but reversing the predisposing factors if possible and selecting the Voriconazole as a primary drug of choice could remarkably decrease mortality [1].\n\nOur literature search yielded 7 cases of infection due to T. asahii in COVID-19 [6], [10], [11]. Rodriguez et al. reported one case of T. asahii fungemia in 20 cases of fungemia in COVID-19 patients with an overall reported mortality of 60 % in that cohort [10]. Gonzalo et al. reported a second case of T. asahii pneumonia in a COVID-19 patient [11]. Of note, this patient also had coinfection with Pseudomonas sp and Stenotrophomonas sp. and received steroids in addition to Tocilizumab as part of COVID-19 management but eventually succumbed to death. Almeida J et al. reported the remaining 5 cases in three months cohort duration with an average time of 23 days intensive care unit hospitalization to develop T. asahii fungemia. Noteworthy, this cohort did not show evidence of horizontal transmission raising the concern for the susceptibility of critically ill COVID-19 patients to T. asahii fungemia [6]\n\nConclusion\n\nTrichosporon asahii fungemia is an emerging invasive pathogen in critically ill Coronavirus disease 2019 patients that require attention due to high mortality and unique resistance profile. The need to be vigilant and actively screening this immunosuppressed population for rare and common fungal infections is paramount. Judicious use of immunosuppressant medications is advisable in such types of patients. Reversal of risk factors with an early selection of Voriconazole as the first option of therapy are crucial steps to prevent potential consequences.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors report no declarations of interest.\n\nFunding\n\nNo funding was received towards the publication.\n\nConsent\n\nA written informed consent was obtained from the patient to include clinical presentation together with results and imaging.

We herein report a case of acute colitis and metachronous esophageal ulcers due to an immune-related adverse event following concomitant pembrolizumab chemotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma. To our knowledge, there have so far been no reports of cases in which both acute immune-mediated colitis and metachronous esophageal ulcers developed. We therefore report the details of this case along with a review of the pertinent literature.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nThe recent introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has increased the frequency of use of these drugs in daily clinical practice. ICIs are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that occur via a mechanism that differs from that of adverse events associated with conventional anti-cancer drugs. As the clinical use of ICIs increases, a concomitant increase in gastrointestinal mucosal disorders is expected. We herein report a case in which acute immune-mediated colitis and metachronous esophageal ulcers developed during the course of chemotherapy with pembrolizumab, along with a review of the pertinent literature.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 60-year-old man with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool was referred to our department. His medical history was as follows: appendicitis (at the age of 13 years of age), cerebral infarction (at the age of 47 years), and bilateral hip arthroplasty (at the age of 54 years). His life history was as follows: drinking history - ethanol 72 g/d (since the age of 20 years); and smoking history - 60 cigarettes/d\u00d740 years (20-59 years).\n\nThe patient underwent an enema X-ray examination during a health checkup in April 2019. The examination indicated a mass lesion in the sigmoid colon. Colonoscopy (CS) performed by a local doctor thereafter revealed a steeply rising tumor in the sigmoid colon. The tumor margin was composed of a normal mucosa, and only the central recess area was reddish and accompanied by vascular atypia (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1. Colonoscopic findings by a former doctor. The examination indicated a mass lesion revealed a steeply rising in the sigmoid colon. The tumor margin was composed of normal mucosa, and only the central recess area was reddish and accompanied by vascular atypia.\n\nA biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Subsequent systemic examinations revealed a mass lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung and extensive right pleural effusion. Metastatic lesions were suspected based on the macroscopic morphology of the sigmoid colon tumor, which was atypical as the primary lesion.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with sigmoid colon metastasis of the primary lung cancer, carcinomatous pleurisy, and lymph node metastasis (hilar, parabronchi, tracheal bifurcation, para-aorta, para-esophagus, and supraclavicular fossa), and thus was admitted to the division of respiratory of our hospital. The patient was treated with concomitant carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab chemotherapy for right hilar lung adenocarcinoma (cTXN3M1c, cStage IVb) from June 2019. He patient developed febrile neutropenia on d 13, and antibacterial drug (tazobactam/piperacillin) administration was started.\n\nThere were no particular issues with defecation habits both prior to and during the course of treatment. However, the patient experienced spontaneous abdominal pain followed by bloody diarrheal stool and bloody stool over 20 times on d 14. Therefore, on d 15, he was referred to our department for a thorough examination. The laboratory data were as follows: Grade 3 neutropenia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events: CTCAE ver. 4.0) with a white blood cell count of 1,900/mm3 and neutrophil count of 889/mm3; C-reactive protein level of 2.78 mg/dL; and mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL. Transaminases were outlier [aspartate aminotransferase 46 U/L (normal range: 13-30 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase 92 U/L (normal range: 10-42 U/L)], and no renal dysfunction or thyroid dysfunction was observed [blood urea nitrogen 11.7 mg/dL (normal range: 8-20 mg/dL), serum creatinine 0.95 mg/dL (normal range: 0.65-1.07 mg/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone 1.27 \u03bcIU/mL (normal range: 0.35-4.94 \u03bcIU/mL), free triiodothyronine 2.6 pg/mL (normal range: 1.88-3.18 pg/mL) and free tetraiodothyronine 0.78 ng/dL (normal range: 0.7-1.48 ng/dL)].\n\nA CS was conducted for a careful examination owing to the bloody diarrheal stools and bloody stools. The CS findings (Fig. 2) included circumferential edematous changes, dark-purple rough mucosa, mucous adhesion, and erosion in the intestinal tract on the oral side of the sigmoid colon 30 cm from the anal margin. The patient experienced severe pain during CS; therefore, the observations were limited to the lower part of the descending colon, and the edematous mucosa of the sigmoid colon was biopsied. The mass lesion in the sigmoid colon, which was observed by a previous doctor, could not be confirmed. The entire colon could not be observed with the CS; therefore, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed to confirm the lesion and determine its extent.\n\nFigure 2. Colonoscopic findings. The examination indicated circumferential edematous changes, dark-purple rough mucosa, mucous adhesion, and erosion in the intestinal tract on the oral side of the sigmoid colon 30 cm from the anal margin.\n\nContrast-enhanced CT (Fig. 3) revealed severe, continuous circumferential wall thickening from the ascending colon to the sigmoid colon. Submucosal edema was particularly significant. Furthermore, increased adipose tissue concentration around the intestinal tract and mild ascites retention in the pelvic cavity were observed.\n\nFigure 3. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomographic findings. Severe, continuous circumferential wall thickening was observed from the ascending colon to the sigmoid colon. Submucosal edema was particularly significant. Furthermore, increased adipose tissue density concentration around the intestinal tract and mild ascites retention in the pelvic cavity were observed.\n\nIt was difficult to distinguish between carboplatin-induced or pembrolizumab-induced colitis and ischemic colitis based on the patient's symptoms and CS findings. CT revealed that the lesion had spread over the entire large intestine, which was atypical for ischemic colitis. Specific bacteria were not identified in stool cultures collected during the colonoscopy procedure; therefore, infectious enteritis was deemed to be unlikely.\n\nThus, a diagnosis of Grade 3 immune-mediated colitis was made based on CTCAE ver. 4.0. The administration of anticancer drugs was suspended and intravenous steroid (prednisolone; PSL) injection therapy (60 mg/d) started. Treatment also involved fasting and fluid replacement management. Abdominal pain, bloody diarrheal stools, and bloody stools improved 5 days after the start of treatment (d 19). The results of the histopathological examination of the edematous mucosa of the sigmoid colon are shown in Fig. 4.\n\nFigure 4. Histopathological findings in the sigmoid colon. The examination revealed surface layer erosion and hemorrhaging, and mild lymphocyte infiltration in the lamina propria (arrow). Only a few apoptosis-like changes were observed; there were no crypt abscesses, and neutrophil inflammation was mild (a). Immunohistochemical staining showed no bias in CD4- and CD8-positive T cells (b) (the scale bar shows 50 \u03bcm).\n\nFurther examination revealed surface layer erosion and hemorrhaging, and mild lymphocyte infiltration in the lamina propria. Only a few apoptosis-like changes were observed; there were no crypt abscesses, and neutrophil inflammation was mild (Fig. 4a). Immunohistochemical staining showed no bias in CD4- and CD8-positive T cells (Fig. 4b).\n\nRepeat CS performed 2 weeks after the start of PSL treatment showed improved mucosal findings of the sigmoid colon (16 days) (Fig. 5). No clearly abnormal findings were noted during the observation of the entire colon. Thereafter, the PSL administration was gradually reduced, and abdominal symptoms did not recur. Intravenous PSL administration (60 mg/d) was continued for 1 week, after which it was switched to oral administration (40 mg/d). The dose was gradually reduced by 10 mg/week until a dose of 10 mg/d was reached. Thereafter, a dose of 10 mg/d was administered for 4 weeks, followed by 5 mg/d for 2 weeks, and 4 mg/d for 4 weeks. Then, the dose was reduced to 2 mg/d and 1 mg/d in 1 week, with administration concluding on d 120. Oral rabeprazole sodium (5 mg/d) was concomitantly administered during oral PSL administration.\n\nFigure 5. Colonoscopic findings on 15 days of steroid treatment. Follow-up colonoscopy showed improved mucosal findings of the sigmoid colon.\n\nThe progress was favorable; however, epigastric pain developed on d 109 of pembrolizumab administration (d 84 of PSL treatment, oral administration at 4 mg/d), and the patient was once again referred to our department. Laboratory data showed the number of white blood cells to be elevated, but the patient had normal C-reactive protein levels and no hepato-renal dysfunction at the time of re-examination. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was conducted with the aim of carrying out a careful examination.\n\nEGD (Fig. 6): Mottled white patches were mainly noted in the soft palate of the oropharynx, indicative of oral candidiasis. Shallow and extensive map-like ulcers were observed extending from the upper esophagus 17 cm from the incisor to the gastric junction of the esophagus. The ulcer margin was reddish, and regenerated epithelium was observed. A biopsy was performed from the margin of the esophageal ulcer at the time of the EGD. However, there was no epithelial component, and immunohistological analyses could not be conducted.\n\nFigure 6. Esophagogastroduodenoscopic findings on day 100 of steroid treatment. Shallow and extensive map-like ulcers were observed extending from the upper esophagus 17 cm from the incisor to the gastric junction of the esophagus. The ulcer margin was reddish, and a regenerated epithelium was observed.\n\nPSL was administered for the management of colitis. Esophageal lesions developed despite the concomitant use of 5 mg/d rabeprazole sodium. The lesion was widespread, and its extent was relatively uniform according to its esophageal site. Therefore, this was considered to be atypical for reflux esophagitis. An EGD was conducted in May 2019 before chemotherapy treatments began, which detected a hiatal hernia, but reflux esophagitis was not observed. Moreover, atrophic gastritis was also not shown in the stomach. The patient's history with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is unknown, particularly as H. pylori antibody levels in serum samples were absent (<3 U/mL; normal range <3 U/mL). Therefore, we diagnosed the esophagitis as being due to an irAE. Rabeprazole was switched to 20 mg/d vonoprazan fumarate, and the oral administration of 90 mL/d sodium alginate was also started.\n\nAn EGD conducted 1 week later showed that these treatments had a healing effect on the esophageal ulcer (Fig. 7), and oral candidiasis resolved. Although PCR tests for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpesvirus (HSV) were not performed, there were no characteristics of CMV/HSV, such as intranuclear inclusion bodies, in the biopsied tissues. In addition, the esophagitis improved without any antiviral treatment, suggesting that an unusual viral infection caused esophagitis in the patient. Moreover, there have been no reports of drug-induced esophagitis with PSL and anticancer drugs, except for pembrolizumab.\n\nFigure 7. Esophagogastroduodenoscopic findings on day 107 of steroid treatment. Follow-up esophagogastric duodenoscopy showed healing of the esophageal ulcer.\n\nThe oral administration of PSL was stopped on d 118. There was no subsequent recurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Concomitant carboplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy (excluding pembrolizumab) was changed as the second-line therapy for the lung cancer. A modified course of treatment was started in October 2019 (d 108). Neither the colitis nor the esophagitis became exacerbated during the second course of chemotherapy treatment with the same dose of the first course that lacked except pembrolizumab. Therefore, immune-mediated colitis was diagnosed during the first course of chemotherapy. The patient's general condition worsened due to thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction in December 2019, and the patient died due to the primary disease in January 2020.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe herein report a case of acute colitis and metachronous esophageal ulcers due to an irAE following concomitant pembrolizumab chemotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma. With regard to ICIs in Japan, anti-CTLA-4 antibody and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody preparations for use against malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and head and neck cancer are covered by insurance. Both types of preparations exhibit antitumor effects by activating an immune response to tumor cells. However, the use of these preparations is also known to lead to various irAEs including skin disorders, gastrointestinal toxicity (enteritis and diarrhea), autoimmune hepatitis, endocrine disorders (hypophysitis and thyroiditis), interstitial pneumonia, and myasthenia gravis (1).\n\nGastrointestinal toxicity is the second most common adverse event (11.6%) associated with the use of these preparations, behind skin disorders (15%) (2). Shivaji et al. (3) reported treatment-related diarrhea in 6.6-12.5%, 1.1-1.8%, and 0.4-2.2% among those who used anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 antibody preparations, respectively. The corresponding percentages of those with serious diarrheal complications of Grade 3 or 4 were 5.5-11.4%, 1-1.7%, and 0.1-1.1%.\n\nThe concomitant use of anti-PD-1 antibody and anti-CTLA-4 antibody preparation therapy against malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma is also currently covered by national insurance. However, the risk of immune-mediated colitis increases with this type of concomitant therapy, and it has been reported that 13.6% of patients in whom these treatments were used developed enteritis complications (4). Furthermore, severe complications (CTCAE Grade 3 or higher) were reported in 9.4% of cases (3). Compared to monotherapy, the concomitant use of these two preparations increases the frequency of diarrhea and enteritis; therefore, more careful examinations are necessary.\n\nThe risk factors for immune-mediated colitis include a history of inflammatory bowel disease, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and medical narcotics, concomitant use of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody preparation therapy, malignant melanoma (lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma), and an increase in members from Firmicutes phylum among intestinal flora (5).\n\nOur patient did not have a history of using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics; subsequently,the ICI used for lung adenocarcinoma was an anti-PD-1 antibody preparation. Therefore, the patient was not at a clear risk of immune-mediated colitis. However, there have been no reports on the development of immune-mediated colitis according to individual risk factors, and large-scale reports based on further case accumulation are therefore needed.\n\nNishida et al. (6) reported that the onset of gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea/colitis) depended on the type of drug used. It has been reported that the onset of symptoms often occurred 6-7 weeks after the initial administration in the case of anti-CTLA-4 antibody preparations, whereas this was delayed in the case of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody preparations. It has also been reported that the onset of symptoms often occurs within 4 months of starting treatment (7). Our patient developed immune-mediated colitis at an early stage of approximately 2 weeks after starting treatment. This finding differs from those reported previously; however, it should be noted that immune-mediated colitis can develop at an early stage after starting drug administration.\n\nRedness, the disappearance of the vascular structure, erosion, ulcers, and granular mucosa have been reported as characteristic CS findings of immune-mediated colitis. Of these, granular mucosa with lost vascular structure has often been reported as an ulcerative colitis-like mucosal lesion, which is considered to be a characteristic finding of immune-mediated colitis (8). Reports have not indicated any clear differences in the distribution or findings of lesions between anti-CTLA-4 antibody and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody preparations (2,9,10,11). The CS findings in our patient were consistent with those of ischemic colitis.\n\nThe histopathological characteristics of immune-mediated colitis include infiltration of inflammatory cells in the mucosa, crypt abscesses, cryptitis, and apoptosis (8). Predominance of CD4-positive T cells has been reported in patients with colitis due to anti-CTLA-4 antibody preparations, while that of CD8-positive T cells was observed in patients with colitis due to anti-PD-1 antibody preparations (12). Meanwhile, non-specific findings such as an increase in the number of cells in the lamina propria (monocyte predominance) and migration of neutrophils into the mucosa have been observed, and it has been reported that there were no clear differences in the histopathology between these preparations (13).\n\nIn our case, the histopathological images showed erosion and bleeding on the surface of the colon mucosa, but crypt abscesses or inflammation induced via neutrophils were not conspicuous. Immunohistochemistry showed no differences between CD4- and CD8-positive T cells. Nevertheless, we observed unusual histopathological characteristics from immune-mediated colitis derived from anti-PD-1 antibody preparations. Throughout the course of colitis and from microscopic examination,infectious enterocolitis (e.g., CMV, Clostridioides difficile, or parasite infection) were unlikely.Moreover, ischemic colitis was also unlikely as the CT images showed extensive colitis, resulting in the diagnosis of immune-mediated colitis. Fortunately, the diagnostic treatment for immune-mediated colitis, PSL, was effective.\n\nInterestingly, our patient experienced epigastric pain approximately 15 weeks after the onset of immune-mediated colitis, and this was accompanied by metachronous esophageal ulcers induced via ICI therapy. A PubMed search from January 2015 to June 2020 with the keywords \u201cpembrolizumab\u201d and \u201cesophagitis\u201d showed five case reports (including our own) on esophagitis due to pembrolizumab (Table) (14-17). All cases other than our own were of esophagitis, and there were complications of oral mucosal damage in two of the four cases, of which one showed complications of uveal and penile mucosal damage. Furthermore, one of the four cases showed gastritis, duodenal inflammation, and enteritis as well as symptoms such as fever and abdominal pain. With regard to treatment, one out of the four patients was in remission due to drug discontinuation, while the other three received PSL treatment. One of these three patients received infliximab-based treatment. Furthermore, regarding the onset time, our patient had an atypical onset after colitis treatment, whereas, in the other four cases, the onset time was the same as the treatment period.\n\nTable.

Furthermore, CT scans performed during this time did not indicate clear thickening or edematous findings in the esophageal wall. The onset time of esophageal ulcers was not clear; however, at the very least, the patient did not complain of epigastric pain during the onset of colitis. The possibility that symptoms caused by esophageal ulcers were subclinical due to therapeutic intervention with PSL or concomitant rabeprazole sodium thus cannot be ruled out.\n\nIn previous studies, the onset of irAE esophageal ulcer occurred over a period of 2 or more months (14-17). Nivolumab, that is, the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody, has also been reported to cause colitis and esophagitis due to an irAE, which developed 6 months after using nivolumab for Hodgkin's lymphoma (18). The incidence of irAE esophageal ulcers was low; however, there was the possibility of a delayed onset, as was noted in our patient. Therefore, long-term, careful follow-up observations including symptom evaluations are required.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe herein described a case of acute colitis and metachronous esophageal ulcers as irAEs due to ICI therapy for lung cancer. Thus far, there have been no reports on the complications of both illnesses, and hence, the findings of our case are deemed to be valuable.\n\nThe patient gave his informed consent for us to publish these findings.\n\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).",

Successful diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus can lead to the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying malignancy. However, involvement of the respiratory system is typically unresponsive to treatment. Herein, we report the case of a 44-year-old female diagnosed with paraneoplastic pemphigus with underlying follicular lymphoma treated with a chemotherapy regimen including rituximab. Her skin lesions and underlying lymphoma responded to treatment, but bronchiolitis obliterans continued to progress and resulted in fatal respiratory failure.\n\nTEXT:\nINTRODUCTION\n\nParaneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is an autoimmune bullous disorder associated with an underlying neoplasm. The pathogenesis of PNP involves the production of autoantibodies against desmoglein and plakin proteins1. PNP is commonly misdiagnosed because it presents with various clinical manifestations and often resembles other cutaneous diseases. The histopathologic findings of PNP are also nonspecific and include interface dermatitis and lichenoid dermatitis. The detection of autoantibodies against plakin proteins using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) or immunoblot shows high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PNP2.\n\nThere is no standardized treatment guideline for PNP. Systemic steroids are typically used as the first-line treatment, and rituximab could be considered as a secondary treatment option. Although treatment of the underlying neoplasm does not always lead to the treatment of PNP, the prognosis of PNP is determined by the nature of the underlying neoplasm1. PNP has a high mortality rate, and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), which results from the involvement of the respiratory system, is a common cause of death.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nA 44-year-old female visited the emergency room due to a painful oral ulcer, which had developed 6 weeks prior. She had previously been diagnosed with aphthous stomatitis in the otolaryngology department and received systemic steroid treatment, but the oral lesion gradually progressed. She also complained of an erythematous maculopapular rash covering her whole body and conjunctival injection accompanied by fever, diarrhea, and weight loss (Fig. 1). The maculopapular eruption rapidly progressed to ulcerative patches, especially on her palms. She denied any medication history. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia were noted, but all other laboratory tests were within the normal ranges. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) with mucosal involvement was suspected, so she admitted to the internal medicine department for systemic steroid treatment.\n\nThe skin lesion slightly improved after 1.5 mg/kg of methylprednisolone therapy, but the stomatitis was unresponsive. The skin rashes recurred when the dose of methylprednisolone was reduced to below 1 mg/kg, and did not respond to cyclosporine or azathioprine. A skin biopsy was performed for further evaluation, and it showed interface dermatitis and subepidermal blister formation with basal vacuolization. Dyskeratotic cells were detected in the basal layer (Fig. 2). Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) was performed twice, and showed a negative result and linear deposits of C3 at the dermoepidermal junction, respectively. Antibodies against desmoglein 1 and 3 were not detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IIF was conducted, and immunoglobulin G deposition was detected on the normal human skin, mouse bladder epithelium and mouse lung epithelium (Fig. 3). A diagnosis of PNP was made based on the IIF results.\n\nChest and abdomen computed tomography were performed to detect the underlying neoplasm, and enlargement of the axillary, supraclavicular, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes was observed. Surgical excisional biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node was consistent with follicular lymphoma. Due to bone marrow involvement, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV follicular lymphoma.\n\nThe patient received chemotherapy including rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone. Complete remission of the lymphoma was achieved after six cycles of chemotherapy, confirmed by positron emission tomography. The stomatitis and skin rash were also dramatically improved and well-maintained with low-dose steroid therapy (5 mg/day) for 8 months (Fig. 4). However, the patient developed BO and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and died from respiratory failure 20 months after the initial manifestation of PNP.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAnhalt et al.3 first described PNP as a rare autoimmune blistering disease characterized by painful stomatitis and a polymorphous cutaneous eruption accompanied by the production of autoantibodies. The associated neoplasms are mainly lymphoproliferative disorders. In contrast to other autoimmune blistering diseases, PNP-associated autoantibodies invade not only stratified squamous epithelium but also other types of epithelium including the transitional epithelium of the bladder. When IIF is performed, these autoantibodies react with rat bladder epithelium, so this diagnostic test can be used to distinguish PNP from other blistering diseases.\n\nThe diagnosis of PNP is challenging due to its rare prevalence and various cutaneous manifestations. Given its mucosal involvement, PNP is frequently misdiagnosed as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Although the prevalence of SJS/TEN-like PNP is lower than that of SJS/TEN, its mortality is much higher4. In some cases, PNP is diagnosed before the detection of an underlying malignancy, so early diagnostic work-up of the underlying neoplasm is necessary for treatment. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of SJS and SJS/TEN-like PNP is important, and PNP should be considered in patients with an atypical clinical course of SJS/TEN.\n\nAnhalt et al.3 proposed five diagnostic criteria for PNP, including immunoglobulin G or complement deposition in the intercellular spaces of the epidermis or basement membrane zone, which can be detected using DIF. Our patient showed a negative DIF result, which prevented an earlier diagnosis. DIF shows a sensitivity lower than 50% in the diagnosis of PNP, and PNP is known to have a higher false negative rate than other types of pemphigus14. In contrast, IIF on rat bladder has high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of PNP2. Therefore, if PNP is suspected, the presence of autoantibodies in the patient's serum should be evaluated.\n\nThe prognosis of PNP is highly associated with the nature of the underlying neoplasm. If the underlying tumor is benign or localized, PNP shows good prognosis and early resection of the tumor can lead to a good outcome5. However, treatment of the underlying neoplasm does not always lead to the improvement of PNP1. Systemic steroids are typically used as the first-line treatment for PNP. Recently, several cases of PNP successfully treated with rituximab have been reported678. Rituximab is thought to act by depleting CD20-expressing B cells that produce autoantibodies9.\n\nOur patient exhibited clinical remission of the underlying follicular lymphoma and cutaneous, mucosal involvement of PNP after rituximab treatment. However even after remission, BO progressed and the patient died from respiratory failure. The exact mechanism underlying respiratory tract involvement remains unclear. Autoantibodies may react with plakin proteins on the respiratory epithelium, and destruction of the bronchial epithelium may lead to irreversible airway obstruction1. BO is resistant to conventional treatment for PNP, and lung transplantation is considered the only effective treatment. A previous case report demonstrated that rituximab unsuccessfully treated BO, though evidence for the effectiveness of rituximab against PNP-related BO is still lacking7. In this case, although rituximab successfully treated PNP and the underlying neoplasm, it was ineffective against BO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to discuss the effectiveness of rituximab against PNP and PNP-related BO in a Korean patient. Our case emphasizes the necessity of close monitoring and respiratory support even after PNP enters clinical remission.\n\nIn conclusion, PNP should be suspected in patients presenting with refractory stomatitis with a polymorphous cutaneous eruption, and corresponding diagnostic tests should be performed. Rituximab could be an effective treatment option for PNP, but physicians should be aware of the development of BO.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nWe received the patient's consent form about publishing all photographic materials.

Addition of pegylated interferon cleared viral RNA and supports combination therapy with everolimus plus interferon for COVID-19.\n\nTEXT:\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA in the Coronaviridae family of viruses. 1 While most cases of infection present with mild to moderate symptoms consisting of fever, fatigue, dry cough, headache, hypogeusia, anosmia, nausea, and diarrhea 2 ; roughly 15% of patients develop a severe disease phenotype requiring hospitalization, most commonly due to dyspnea and hypoxia. 3 , 4 Laboratory findings of severe infection include leukopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated serum concentrations of D\u2010dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and c\u2010reactive protein (CRP). 5 Chest computed tomography classically demonstrates bilateral ground glass opacities. 1 Severe pathology associated with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection involves a hyperactive immune response to the virus resulting in a sudden, acute increase in pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, termed \u201cthe cytokine storm\u201d. 6 Elevated cytokine levels prompt an influx of various immune cells into the site of infection, leading to tissue destruction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multi\u2010organ failure. 7 Several mRNA and adenovirus vaccines targeting the spike protein have been approved, 8 but they appear to have reduced efficacy against the multiple higher infectivity and immune evading variants that have arisen. 9 , 10 Thus, general SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 therapies are needed. Early administration of monoclonal antibodies to the spike protein, RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and dexamethasone and late administration of enoxaparin may modify the natural history of the infection, 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 but additional treatments are needed. We previously reported the activity of a ruxolitinib plus interferon combination. 16 In this case report, we examine another combination that may show utility for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections.\n\nWell\u2010differentiated small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors arise from serotonin\u2010producing enterochromaffin cells and show epigenetic alterations frequently leading to PI3K/mTOR activation. 17 Upon metastases to liver and other sites, serotonin escapes liver metabolism, and the carcinoid syndrome occurs with flushing, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 18 Treatments include sandostatin analogues, telotristat ethyl, 177Lu\u2010DOTATATE, everolimus, sunitinib, interferon\u2010\u03b1, and surgical resection or ablation of metastases. 19 Metastatic small intestinal NET patients have a 70% 5\u2010year survival. 20\n\nPI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors have been proposed as a therapy to target viral protein synthesis and the hyperinflammation associated with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 21 mTOR is the serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic subunit of the mTORC1 complex with LST8, PRA540, and raptor. Targets of mTOR include phosphorylation inactivation of 4E\u2010BP\u20101 and LARP\u20101. 22 , 23 The result is release of eIF\u20104E translation initiation factor and stimulation of cap\u2010dependent, 5\u2019\u2010terminal oligopyrimidine tract viral RNA translation. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 proteins N and nsp1 assist in this seminal virus infectivity step. 24 , 25 Inhibitors of mTOR block viral RNA synthesis. 23 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 hyperinflammation is associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome containing the tripartite NLRP3 sensor protein, ASC adapter protein, and caspase\u20101. 26 Infection produces a \u201cpriming\u201d signal with viral RNA binding and signaling through Toll\u2010like receptors or NOD\u2010like receptors leading to NF\u2010\u03baB nuclear translocation, and NLRP3 and procaspase gene expression. 27 Then SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viroporins E, Orf3a and Orf8a cause cellular potassium efflux, NLRP3 oligomerization, ASC recruitment, and, ultimately, procaspase\u20101 recruitment and cleavage. 27 Orf8b aids the steps by binding the leucin\u2010rich repeat domain of NLRP3 facilitating oligomerization. Gasdermin D is cleaved by caspase 1 and pyroptosis occurs along with inflammatory cytokine release. mTOR stimulates the NLRP3 inflammasome by increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species formation and inhibiting autophagy. 28 As predicted, mTOR inhibitors inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome induced hyperinflammation in vitro and in vivo. 29 , 30\n\nInterferons signal through cell surface interferon receptors to JAK and STAT proteins and ultimately induce interferon\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs) that halt viral translation via protein kinase receptor (PKR) and block viral NLRP3\u2010induced inflammation via STAT1. 31 , 32 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 proteins block interferon activity via multiple pathways. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 induced inflammasome caspases degrade interferon and interferon signaling polypeptides. 33 Over a dozen SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 proteins block early interferon induction or activity. 31 Late in the natural history, infection is associated with excessive inflammatory cytokinemia including interferons with dysfunctional T and NK cell responses. 34\n\nWe present the case of a 61\u2010year\u2010old male found to be SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positive who was relatively asymptomatic while taking everolimus for coexisting metastatic neuroendocrine tumor but displayed a prolonged period of nasal swab PCR positivity. Administration of pegylated interferon was followed by prompt clearance of viral RNA by PCR. We hypothesize that the combination of everolimus with interferon may be useful in the acute COVID\u201019 setting to induce viral clearance with reduced risk of cytokine storm.\n\n2 METHODS\n\nInformed consent to monitor, treat, and report the subject was obtained from the patient and approved by the West Palm Beach VAMC Research & Development Committee. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from the patient. Samples were shipped to Orlando for performance of the Gene Xpert Cepheid Innovation XPRSARS\u2010COv2\u201010 RT\u2010PCR assay measuring viral N2 sequence abundance. The limit of detection was 0.01 plaque forming units/mL (CFU/mL) or 250 viral RNA copies/mL with first cycle number above background (Cq) of 39. Blood samples were collected using a serum separator tube and serum also shipped to Orlando for performance of the Abbott Architect anti\u2010N SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG assay with results\u00a0calculated as chemiluminescence ratios of sample to control with negative ratios being <1.4. Other blood samples were collected and assayed for blood counts, chemistries, coagulation tests, and inflammatory peptides at the West Palm Beach VAMC Clinical Laboratories.\n\n3 RESULTS/CASE PRESENTATION\n\nA 61\u2010year\u2010old Caucasian male veteran developed diarrhea, flushing, pruritis, and abdominal pain in June, 2019. Computerized tomography scans showed a jejunal mass and liver lesions. Liver biopsy confirmed well\u2010differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. Blood counts and chemistries were normal, but serotonin was 1246\u00a0ng/mL (normal 50\u2010200\u00a0ng/mL), chromogranin A 781\u00a0ng/L (normal <39ng/L) and 24\u00a0hour urine 5\u2010hydroxyindoleacetic acid was 91\u00a0mg (normal <6\u00a0mg). He was treated with lanreotide 120\u00a0mg subcutaneously weekly in 2019 and began everolimus 10\u00a0mg orally daily starting April 3, 2020. He did well until June 23, 2020 when he noted mild lightheadedness, nausea, cough, headache, clear sputum production, hypogeusia, and anosmia and had a positive SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nasal swab RT\u2010PCR test (Table\u00a01). Exam showed a temperature of 99.1\u00b0F, a pulse rate of 59/min, respiration rate of 20/min, blood pressure of 156/91, weight of 198#, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Blood counts and chemistries were normal except for an aspartate transaminase of 38\u00a0U/L (normal 5\u201034\u00a0U/L). Lactate was 1.57\u00a0mmol/L (normal 0.5\u20102.2\u00a0mmol/L). Coagulation tests (eg, protime and partial thromboplastin time) were normal. Procalcitonin was 0.07\u00a0ng/mL (normal 0\u20100.5\u00a0ng/mL) and C\u2010reactive protein <1\u00a0mg/L (normal <3\u00a0mg/L). Chest x\u2010ray and brain CT scans were normal. He returned home, and his symptoms resolved within several days. However, his RT\u2010PCR assay remained positive repeatedly for 52\u00a0days (Table\u00a01). Because of hospital restrictions at the time on RT\u2010PCR positive patients, he was unable to receive his monthly clinic lanreotide injections. His carcinoid symptoms recurred, and he required breakthrough octreitide acetate 200\u00a0mcg subcutaneous injections every 8\u00a0hours at home. To facilitate viral RNA clearance, on day 53 we elected to try pegylated interferon alpha\u20102a as treatment for both his neuroendocrine tumor and his COVID\u201019. After informed consent and approval by the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center Administration, Pharmacy and Research & Education Committee, the patient received four weekly subcutaneous injections of 90\u00a0mcg pegylated interferon\u2010\u03b1\u20102a. His RT\u2010PCR rapidly cleared within one week of treatment, and he was able to resume somatostatin analogue therapy at the oncology clinic. Initial anti\u2010N SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG and IgM antibodies were absent from his blood (IgG 0.03 and IgG 0.02), but by January, 2021 he had measurable antibodies (IgG 2.07 and IgM 2.18). He remained asymptomatic and is undergoing additional treatments for his metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.\n\nTABLE 1 RT\u2010PCR Cq values\n\nDay\tQuantification Cycle (Cq)\tTest Result\t\n\u221217\t>39\tNegative\t\n1\t28.9\tPositive\t\n15\t23.0\tPositive\t\n25\t27.6\tPositive\t\n38\t27.8\tPositive\t\n52\t32.1\tPositive\t\n69\t>39\tNegative\t\n97\t>39\tNegative\t\n180\t>39\tNegative\t\n191\t>39\tNegative\t\nNote\n\nRT\u2010PCR Cq, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction cycle at which fluorescence detected above baseline.

SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly among older patients with comorbidities. 35 A significant factor contributing to the morbidity and mortality of this infection is the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response as noted above. 36 We were struck by the minimal clinical findings in this high risk, male with a coexisting malignancy. Our patient was on chronic everolimus therapy for metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. As noted above, everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor that may target both viral replication and inflammation. We speculate whether our patient's minimal clinical symptoms throughout his infection could be linked to the anti\u2010inflammatory effect of the drug. Everolimus may reduce the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 inflammatory state, improve the quality of life, and perhaps prolong survival from this devastating disease. This speculation is supported by several case studies. Among 18 hospitalized COVID\u201019 positive renal transplant patients, three were on chronic everolimus. 37 A 60\u2010year\u2010old male and a 40\u2010year\u2010old female were maintained on everolimus and did well; one 40\u2010year\u2010old male had everolimus stopped and died from infection complications. Among 10 COVID\u201019 tuberous sclerosis/lymphangioleiomatosis patients, five were on sirolimus or everolimus and only one was briefly hospitalized and recovered; four of five patients not on mTOR inhibitors were hospitalized and one died. 38 A 45\u2010year\u2010old T3 paraplegic pancreas\u2010kidney transplant male with asthma and chronic renal insufficiency maintained on everolimus developed RT\u2010PCR positive SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and had an eight days hospitalization with transient symptoms. 39 Among 111 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positive liver transplant patients, immunosuppression with mycophenolate was associated with severe disease (risk ratio\u00a0=\u00a05.3); immunosuppression with mTOR inhibitors\u2014tacrolimus or everolimus yielded fewer severe cases (tacrolimus risk ratio =0.54 and everolimus risk ratio =0.77). 40\n\nAn interesting facet of this case is the sustained positivity of the patient's SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 test. He was repeatedly tested for viral RNA clearance by nasal swab RT\u2010PCR secondary to his immunocompromised state, and because he required a negative test prior to treatment at the oncology clinic. Many SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected individuals have persistently positive RT\u2010PCR tests for weeks to months after clinical recovery. 41 Based on viral culture, the percent of these individuals who remain infectious approaches zero by 10\u201015\u00a0days after the onset of symptoms. 41 , 42 , 43 However, shedding of infectious SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has been demonstrated by viral culture or inferred by the presence of subgenomic RNA in a subset of individuals, including immunosuppressed hosts, for months following infection. 44 , 45 We lack Cq values for multiple tests on our patient, but the reported positivity implies a Cq less than 39. Likely our patient had low quantities of viral RNA or viral RNA fragments that were noninfectious.\n\nThe persistent positivity of his SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 testing may be potentially secondary to the immunosuppressive effects of everolimus. 46 mTOR inhibitors inhibit dendritic cell maturation and function and T cell proliferation. In our case, possible hampered antiviral defense was reversed with interferon supplementation with subsequent T cell activation to fight the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Our patient was able to clear the viral RNA after the administration of the first of a total of four treatments of pegylated interferon\u2010\u03b12a while continuing treatment with everolimus. Presence of RT\u2010PCR positivity for one to two months after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is not rare 47 and does not always represent infectious virions.\n\nInterferons have been successfully used in the treatment of viral infections, such as hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, hematologic malignancies, in particular the Philadelphia\u2010negative myeloproliferative neoplasms and neuroendocrine tumors. 48 , 49 , 50 In SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, interferon therapy in phase 2 and phase 3 randomized clinical trials have shown reduced the duration of virus infection, reduced inflammatory markers including IL6 and CRP and reduced mortality when administered early. 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 As a note of caution, type I interferons administered in later stages may cause progressive tissue damage leading to a deleterious hyperinflammation characterized by the excessive macrophage activation and hypercoagulation seen in patients with acute disease. 36 Interestingly, pharmacologic interferon treatment inhibits inflammation early by repressing the NLRP3 inflammasome via STAT1. 32 We hypothesized that administration of interferon in our patient who was minimally symptomatic would strengthen antiviral defense and potentially lead to viral RNA clearance. Our results support the hypothesis.\n\n5 CONCLUSION\n\nThe availability of vaccines will reduce the number of acute cases of COVID\u201019. However, acute cases will continue to exist, requiring therapeutic interventions to reduce toxicities and improve survival. Reducing the cytokine storm appears to be crucial in preventing end organ damage which is associated with high mortality. 59 Genetic and immunologic studies of hospitalized COVID\u201019 subjects showed mutations yielding increased TYK2 or decreased IFNAR2 expression or inactivating mutations in interferon pathway genes\u2014IRF3, IRF7, IFNAR1/2, TBK1 or TLR3 or autoantibodies to interferons had more severe disease. 60 , 61 , 62 These subjects suffered increased inflammatory cytokines and absent antiviral interferons. Targeted immune regulation to reverse this state may provide substantial benefit in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Our case suggests that everolimus plus pegylated interferon is a potential regimen for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 patients. This treatment combination may benefit select patients if used early in the disease. Future studies are needed to elucidate the potential therapeutic benefits and side effects of this regimen.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nNone of the authors has a relevant conflict of interest.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nAEF: Conceived of study, obtained permissions, accessed agents, provided patient care, and wrote draft manuscript.

The patient was diagnosed with PTLD recurrence and was successfully treated with ultra-low-dose RT to both eyes in 2 fractions of 2 Gy. At 15 month follow-up the patient maintained complete disease control with normal IOP off all topical ophthalmic medications.\nUltra-low-dose RT for ocular PTLD of the MALT subtype represents a novel therapeutic approach that may provide a durable treatment response and could be considered as either primary or adjuvant therapy for this rare condition.\n\nTEXT:\n1 Introduction\n\nPost-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are common among solid and hematopoietic transplant recipients and may affect both pediatric and adult patients.1 Ocular PTLD is quite uncommon with a limited number of cases described in the literature. The optimal therapy for this disorder has not been established due to the rarity of this condition, but typically it has been treated with systemic rituximab alone or in combination with low-dose chemotherapy.2, 3, 4 We previously reported the use of systemic rituximab combined with intraocular rituximab and methotrexate.5 In this report, we provide follow-up of the same case treated with ultra-low dose (boom-boom) radiotherapy (RT) for recurrent PTLD.\n\n1.1 Case presentation\n\nA 12-year-old boy presented for persistent bilateral anterior chamber cellular infiltration in the setting of previously treated iris PTLD. Historical details of the case can be found in the prior report on this patient.5 In brief, he underwent orthotopic heart transplantation and developed chronic low-grade Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia due to EBV seromismatch. Five years later, he presented with bilateral granulomatous anterior chamber cellular reaction and multiple iris nodules. The patient underwent systemic screening with routine blood work (complete blood cell count, liver enzymes, and electrolytes), brain magnetic resonance imaging, whole-body positron emission tomography, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which revealed no systemic lymphoproliferative process. Iris biopsy revealed CD20-positive B-cells intermixed with plasma cells resembling extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MALT). A diagnosis of iris PTLD with MALT-like features was made, with no associated systemic lymphoproliferative process. Following no improvement with topical 1% prednisolone acetate and cessation of mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression, he was managed with concomitant systemic rituximab and a total of 5 bilateral intraocular rituximab injections (1 mg/0.1 mL) administered under general anesthesia, with initial disease control. A few months later, recurrence of anterior chamber cellular infiltration and keratic precipitates prompted a single bilateral intravitreal methotrexate (400 mcg in 0.1 mL) injection under general anesthesia. This led to sustained remisson with control of cellular infiltration for 4 months. Subsequent follow-up 4 months later showed no evidence of ocular toxicity from methotrexate. However, worsening recurrent cellular infiltration in the interim prompted initiation of topical 1% prednisolone acetate 3\u20134 times daily and disease progression 11 months after methotrexate injection prompted increase of topical corticosteroids to 6 times daily, with worsening cellular infiltration on several attempts to wean topical therapy. This prompted re-referral of the patient to our ocular oncology service.\n\nThe patient was examined 28 months after methotrexate injection with visual acuity of 20/30 and 20/25 and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 32 and 10\u00a0mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. Anterior chamber examination revealed 1+ and trace cellular infiltration in the right and left eyes, respectively. There were several small keratic precipitates in the right eye and none in the left eye. The 1% prednisolone acetate was tapered and a topical ocular hypotensive agent was initiated in the right eye, while maintaining 1% prednisolone acetate three times daily in the left eye. The patient was examined 1 month later, and IOP had improved to 11\u00a0mmHg in the right eye, although there was persistent anterior chamber infiltration and keratic precipitates. The decision was made to proceed with ultra-low-dose \u201cboom boom\u201d RT using a total of 4 Gray (Gy) delivered in 2 fractions of 2 Gy on consecutive days, with the intention to render a curative treatment and enable cessation of topical corticosteroids.\n\nA single anterior proton beam was used to treat each anterior chamber and iris accounting for 3 mm setup and treatment uncertainties (Fig. 1A). To reduce radiation scatter to periocular adnexa, orbital rim bones, and midfacial soft tissues the proton beam was delivered through a bolus shell of 42 mm water-equivalent thickness placed 3 cm from the patient's surface (Fig. 1B). Each of the two treatments was performed under general anesthesia, and ocular alignment was verified by computed tomography-on-rails in the proton treatment room. One month following RT, the patient had neither anterior chamber cellular infiltration nor keratic precipitates. Visual acuity improved to 20/20 in the right eye and was stable at 20/25 in the left eye; IOP was 7 and 10\u00a0mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. With continued follow-up over several months, topical corticosteroid was gradually tapered and IOP lowering drops were discontinued.Fig. 1 Ultra\u2013low-dose radiotherapy for bilateral iris PTLD was applied to both anterior chambers and iris with 4 Gy in 2 fractions using a single anterior proton beam accounting for 3 mm setup and treatment uncertainties (A). In order to minimize radiation scatter we delivered the proton beam through a bolus shell of 42 mm water-equivalent thickness placed 3 cm from the patient (B).\n\nFig. 1\n\nFifteen months after RT, the patient remained free of all topical ophthalmic medications. Visual acuity was 20/30 and 20/40 and IOP was 7 and 8 in the right and left eyes, respectively. There was no evidence of an anterior chamber cellular reaction, flare, keratic precipitates, or iris nodules in either eye. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable without evidence of lenticular or fundus changes, and updated brain and spine MRI showed no concerning features for lymphoma. Given stable clinical examination, the reduction in the measured visual acuity was thought to be due to fluctuation in patient effort due to changes in systemic antiepileptic medications.\n\n2 Discussion\n\nPTLD is the most common malignancy associated with both solid-organ and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.1 For solid organ transplantation, the incidence density (adjusted for time under immunosuppression) of PTLD is highest for lung (5.7 per 1000 person-years) followed by liver (2.4), heart (2.2), and kidney (1.6) transplantation. EBV seromismatch (donor positive/recipient negative) is a major risk factor for pediatric PTLD as most transplant recipients are EBV seronegative.1 For children receiving solid-organ transplant, the standardized incidence ratio (the rate of observed cases in the transplanted group with respect to age-specific rates from a reference population) of non-Hodgkin PTLD may exceed 200\u2010fold.6 Other risk factors for PTLD development include male gender and Caucasian race, all of which were present in our patient.1\n\nAmong all organs affected by PTLD, the eyes are very rarely affected with only a few dozen cases reported. Prior reports have described treatment of ocular PTLD with systemic therapy combining rituximab with low-dose chemotherapy.2, 3, 4 Our patient was previously treated with systemic and intraocular rituximab followed by intraocular methotrexate for recurrence, with disease control for 5 months.5 Unfortunately, recurrence of ocular PTLD occurred, prompting initiation of topical corticosteroids, which resulted in secondary ocular hypertension.\n\nThe goal of using fractionated ultra-low-dose RT (termed \u201cboom boom\u201d RT) was to induce remission and enable discontinuation of topical corticosteroids to prevent glaucoma and cataract development. We chose not to administer intravitreal rituximab or methotrexate again because of only temporary disease control with those agents previously, and to eliminate repeated general anesthesia to administer such therapy (6 prior visits under general anesthesia versus 2 with RT).\n\nUltra-low-dose RT has been successfully used for ocular adnexal lymphoma with excellent disease control (ranging from 96 to 100%) and minimal side effects.7,8 These lymphomas are typically low-grade indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas, similar to the type found in our patient, and are exquisitely radiosensitive. RT has also been effective for treating choroidal lymphoma.9 We are unaware of other reported cases of ocular PTLD that were successfully treated with ultra-low-dose RT. We did not detect any adverse effects at 15 month follow-up, and the RT was efficacious in inducing disease remission and allowing rapid taper of topical ophthalmic medications. This therapeutic approach may be especially useful in pediatric PTLD cases as it could provide durable disease control without the need for repeated general anesthesia. It is possible that local RT treatment could replace systemic therapy with rituximab and chemotherapies that have considerable risks in the setting of an immunosuppressed patient. In addition, given the very low total radiation dose delivered in this protocol, retreatment with RT for potential future recurrences is likely to be well-tolerated, as suggested by data from studies in extra-ocular lymphoma.10 Our patient was not treatment na\u00efve and thus we cannot be certain that RT would have been as efficacious if he hadn't received prior systemic and local treatment. However, given a quick and robust initial response to this treatment with sustained remission for many months, it is likely that this approach could be utilized as a primary treatment modality. Additional investigation of ultra-low-dose RT for ocular PTLD is warranted.\n\n3 Conclusions and importance\n\nOcular PTLD is a rare disorder with a paucity of evidence to determine standard of care treatment. We presented a case of recurrent iris PTLD in a pediatric patient treated with ultra-low-dose (boom-boom) fractionated RT. Excellent disease control was maintained for at least 15 months, suggesting this may be a viable alternative treatment option and possibly a cure. Ultra-low-dose RT for ocular PTLD could be considered as an initial therapeutic approach or when other forms of therapy have shown suboptimal response.\n\nPatient consent\n\nThe patient's parent consented to publication of the case in writing.\n\nFunding\n\nNo funding or grant support.\n\nAuthorship\n\nAll authors attest that they meet the current ICMJE criteria for Authorship.\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n\nAll of the authors report no financial disclosures.",

The patient was treated with multiple anti-inflammatory drugs and high-dose prednisone. After the fifth MVR, the patient remained in stable condition using Anakinra after 22\u00a0months of follow-up. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).\n\nTEXT:\npmcHistory of Presentation\n\nA 27-year-old man was referred to our tertiary cardiac center for diagnosis and treatment of repetitive endocarditis. The patient had already undergone 2\u00a0mechanical mitral valve replacements (MVR) within 2.5\u00a0months because of repetitive culture-negative endocarditis treated with antibiotics, and\u00a0severe mitral valve (MV) insufficiency. The first and second MVR were performed, respectively, 2.5\u00a0months and 1\u00a0month before transfer. He was referred to our hospital during his third endocarditis episode. At referral, the patient presented with fatigue, dyspnea, and palpitations. On examination, a heart murmur at the apex was present. Furthermore, vital functions were normal, and no lymphadenopathy or joint abnormalities were objectified. His face and back showed scars from acne, and his axilla and groin area showed scars from previous hidradenitis. A positron emission tomography scan before referral revealed no abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose uptake.Learning objectives\n\n\u2022 To report a rare case of an unexplained repetitive immune-mediated noninfectious endocarditis\n\n\u2022 To discuss the management options of an unexplained repetitive immune-mediated noninfectious endocarditis\n\n\u2022 To illustrate that despite extensive diagnostic efforts, even today it is sometimes impossible to establish a fitting diagnosis\n\n\u2022 To emphasize the importance of continuous and multidisciplinary collaboration in diagnostic and therapeutic efforts\n\nMedical History\n\nHis cardiac history before the first MVR consisted of severe primary MV insufficiency resulting from MV prolapse, with subsequent atrial fibrillation. An MV repair and minimaze procedure were performed 18\u00a0months before the first MVR. After 6\u00a0months, the patient presented with thoracic pain, diagnosed as Dressler syndrome or serositis. Two months later he was readmitted for recurrent serositis. His further medical history consisted of a nasal septum correction, testicular torsion, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne vulgaris, and a tooth extraction. He did not have a history of connective tissue disease (CTD) or thrombotic events. His family history was positive for cardiac disease. His father had an arrhythmia of unknown origin at 30 years of age. The family history for CTD was negative.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n\nThe first 2 episodes of endocarditis were, according to the modified Duke criteria, \u201crejected\u201d for infectious origin because there was no pathologic evidence for infectious endocarditis at surgery, with antibiotic therapy\u00a0\u22644\u00a0days (1). Therefore, noninfectious causes, such as antiphospholipid syndrome or inflammatory reaction to implanted material, were included in the differential diagnosis (Figure\u00a01).Figure\u00a01 Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis of the case.\n\nInvestigations\n\nIn the Appendix, all diagnostic tests are shown that were performed before every MVR (Supplemental Table\u00a01).\n\nCytoplasmatic antibodies were detected at the referring center; however, proteinase-3 specificity could not be confirmed. Test results for antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies at our center were negative. Rheumatoid factor immunoglobulin M was weakly positive. The results of polymerase chain reactions and blood and valve cultures were persistently negative. Inflammatory parameters, specifically neutrophil count, were consistently elevated. Flow cytometry of neutrophils established elevated progenitor cells, which can point to the presence of chronic neutrophilic leukemia or a reactive process. Subsequently, cytomorphologic analysis of bone marrow aspirate ruled out chronic neutrophilic leukemia or any other myeloproliferative disease. Owing to a suspicion of heritable (auto-)inflammatory disease, next-generation sequencing for primary immunodeficiency was performed, and the result proved negative. The result of (non-)criteria antiphospholipid antibody assays were negative. Table\u00a01 shows the laboratory and echocardiography parameters at hospitalization before each MVR.\u00a0Importantly, the results of patch tests, although\u00a0performed under high-dose prednisone, investigating hypersensitivity to polyethylene terephtelate (Dacron) and polypropylene from sutures and/or sewing cuffs from the implanted MVs, were negative (2).Table\u00a01 Patient Characteristics Before Every Mitral Valve Replacement\n\n\tReference Values\tFirst Mitral Valve Replacement\tSecond Mitral Valve Replacement\tThird Mitral Valve Replacement\tFourth Mitral Valve Replacement\tFifth Mitral Valve Replacement\t\nTime after first mitral valve replacement (months)\t\t0\t2\t3\t30\t32\t\nImplanted mitral valve\t\tSorin bicarbon fitline 31\u00a0mm\tSorin bicarbon fitline 31\u00a0mm\tCarbomedics 33\u00a0mm\u00a0+ bovine pericardial patch\tCarpentier-Edwards Perimount 33\u00a0mm\tSt. Jude Medical 33\u00a0mm\u00a0+ bovine pericardial patch\t\nType of valve (mechanical vs bio prothesis)\t\tMechanical\tMechanical\tMechanical\tBioprothesis\tMechanical\t\nMedical treatment prior to mitral valve replacement\t\tNone\tAcenocoumarol\tAcenocoumarol and ceftriaxone (1\u00a0day before surgery)\tPrednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, ciprofloxacin and acenocoumarol\tPrednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, Anakinra and Fenprocoumon\t\nMedical treatment after mitral valve replacement\t\tUnknown\tVoriconazole, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline (all were discontinued when cultures were negative) and acenocoumarol\tCeftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin\tFenprocoumon, prednisone, ciprofloxacin, and rituxan\tFenprocoumon, ticagrelor, prednisone, and anakinra\t\nMedical treatment in outpatient clinic\t\tAcenocoumarol\tAcenocoumarol\tAcenocoumarol, ticagrelor, prednisone, and ciclosporin (later switched to adalimumab, hydroxycarbamide, and rituxan)\tFenprocoumon, prednisone, and rituxan\tFenprocoumon, ticagrelor, prednisone, and anakinra\t\nClinical presentation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u00a0Key symptoms\t\tExercise intolerance and fatigue\tDysarthria and vertigo\tDyspnea, fever, and atrial flutter\tFatigue and diplopia\tNo symptoms\t\n\u00a0Diagnosis of key symptoms\t\tEndocarditis lenta\tMultiple lacunar infarctions due to vegetations on mitral valve\tVegetations on mitral valve\tTransient ischemic attacks and vegetations on mitral valve\tRoutine transesophageal echocardiography: vegetations on mitral valve\t\n\u00a0Fever (\u226538.5 \u00b0C)\t\tNo\tNo\tYes\tNo\tNo\t\n\u00a0Largest vegetation (mm)\t\t15\tUnknown\t18\t19\t31\t\n\u00a0(Para)valvular dysfunction\t\tModerate mitral valve regurgitation\tUnknown\tMassive paravalvular leakage\tMild valvular leakage\tMild paravalvular leakage\t\n\u00a0White blood cell count (\u00d7109/L)\t4-10\t10.9\t11.3\t12.8\t15.6\t16.3\t\n\u00a0Neutrophil count (\u00d7109/L)\t1.6-8.3\t-\t-\t9.61\t14.3\t12.9\t\n\u00a0C-reactive protein (mg/mL)\t0-10\t8.6\t21\t29\t8.4\t12\t\n\u00a0Creatine kinase (U/L)\t0-145\t-\t165\t21\t28\t26\t\n\u00a0Troponin T (\u03bcg/L)\t0-0.014\t-\t0.037\t-\t-\t-\t\n\u00a0Troponin I (ng/L)\t0-45\t-\t-\t-\t28\t7\t\n\u00a0Hemoglobin (mmol/L)\t7.4-9.6\t-\t6.5\t7\t8.8\t7.9\t\n\u00a0Haptoglobin (g/L)\t0,3-2\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t\n\u00a0Sodium (mmol/L)\t136-146\t-\t144\t138\t140\t135\t\n\u00a0Potassium (mmol/L)\t3.8-5.0\t-\t3.7\t3.6\t4.2\t4\t\n\u00a0Urea (mmol/L)\t3.0-7.5\t-\t-\t5.6\t8.4\t7.1\t\n\u00a0Creatinine (mmol/L)\t49-90\t-\t70\t67\t91\t94\t\n\u00a0Estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/ 1.73 m2)\t>80\t-\t-\t>90\t>90\t>90\t\n\u00a0Total bilirubin (\u03bcmol/L)\t3-21\t-\t-\t10\t14\t17\t\n\u00a0Aspartate transaminase (U/L)\t0-30\t-\t-\t23\t25\t32\t\n\u00a0Albumin (g/L)\t35-50\t-\t-\t43.3\t43.1\t-\t\n\nManagement\n\nGiven that the first 2 episodes of endocarditis were \u201crejected\u201d for infectious origin, an infectious origin was thought to be unlikely. Therefore, an autoimmune cause was thought to be causative for the recurrent vegetations. Nevertheless, while awaiting blood cultures, the patient was extensively treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimycotics. He did not experience symptoms or show signs indicative of underlying CTD or vasculitis (3,4). Figure\u00a02 shows the prescribed medication and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) parameters over time.Figure\u00a02 Vegetations Versus Immunosuppressive Agents\n\nMitral valve vegetations plotted against the use of immunosuppressive medication and prednisone. Asterisks indicate a mitral valve replacement.\n\nTwo days after transfer, TEE showed a partially disconnected MV with massive paravalvular leakage (Video 1) and multiple vegetations, the largest being 18\u00a0mm on the MV ring (Figure\u00a03A; Video 2). An emergency MVR was performed, a 33-mm Carbomedics with a bovine pericardial patch was implanted. This reinforced the sewing cuff for enhanced fixation to the annulus, preventing a second disconnected MV. Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone was prescribed, followed by oral prednisolone, to suppress the hypothesized autoimmune response. Cyclosporin was added because a previous case of unexplained recurrent autoimmune-mediated endocarditis had been successfully treated with cyclosporin. However, 3\u00a0months after cyclosporin had been started and a prednisone taper had begun, a minor stroke occurred caused by a relapse of the endocarditis. Prednisone was increased again, and cyclosporin was replaced by adalimumab to treat a possible innate inflammatory cause, considering his previous hidradenitis. Unfortunately, after 4\u00a0months and 2 attempts to taper the prednisone dose, asymptomatic vegetations as large as 14\u00a0mm on the MV ring were visualized by echocardiography. Owing to pronounced neutrophilia with the presence of progenitor cells in the blood, a myeloproliferative disease such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia was considered, and adalimumab was switched to hydroxycarbamide to specifically target the neutrophils with increased dosing of prednisone. Although chronic neutrophilic leukemia was ruled out soon after hydroxycarbamide was started, the hydroxycarbamide was continued because a neutrophil maturation problem was thought to be causative of the repetitive immune-mediated noninfectious endocarditis. Despite the treatment with hydroxycarbamide, the patient had, over the course of 11\u00a0months, multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) caused by multiple vegetations on the MV ring when the prednisone dose was tapered, the largest vegetation being 18\u00a0mm. Therefore, myeloproliferative disease was rejected, and seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome was considered, allowing, apart from increasing prednisone dosing, a therapeutic switch to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Rituxan. After 7\u00a0months the patient again experienced several TIAs caused by progression of vegetations on the MV ring (Figure\u00a03B, Video 3), necessitating a fourth MVR. A bioprosthetic 33-mm Carpentier-Edwards Perimount was placed, with IVIG before and after the MVR. Despite these measures, 2\u00a0months after the fourth MVR, the patient had on routine examination TEE vegetations on multiple valve leaflets, the largest being 31\u00a0mm (Figure\u00a03C, Video 4). A fifth MVR was performed, and a mechanical 33-mm (St. Jude Medical) was implanted with a bovine pericardial patch reinforcing the sewing cuff for enhanced fixation to the annulus. Because of the recurrent vegetations, IVIG and rituxan were changed to subcutaneous anakinra 100\u00a0mg once daily, to suppress the presumed underlying autoimmune disease differently. Fortunately, after a 32-month disease process from the first MVR to the fifth MVR, this finally resulted in sustained absence of vegetations on the MVR and successful taper of prednisone.Figure\u00a03 Vegetations on the Mitral Valve Before Mitral Valve Replacements\n\n(A) Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before the third mitral valve replacement (MVR), showing an 18-mm mobile vegetation attached to the mitral valve (MV) ring.

(C) TEE before the fifth MVR, showing a very large (31-mm) irregular and mobile vegetation seemingly attached to both MV leaflets. (D) TEE 2\u00a0weeks after the fifth MVR, visualizing a small (5-mm) structure in the posterior annulus. Arrows indicate the vegetations.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe describe a case of noninfectious endocarditis resulting in 5 MVRs. The diagnostic workup was done according to the guidelines, excluding infection, malignancy, rheumatic disease, and an allergic reaction (5,6).\n\nExtraordinarily, all vegetations on the implanted mechanical valves were sterile and on the MV ring (Supplemental Figures\u00a01 and 2), potentially indicating an inflammatory response to components of the MV ring. Although the valves implanted were from 4 different manufacturers, making a specific inflammatory response less likely, all manufacturers use, in different arrangements, Dacron in the sewing cuff. However, a negative patch test result excluded Dacron as a trigger for the inflammatory response. A systemic disease was thought to be likely because of the presence of extracardiac manifestations, such as severe acne and hidradenitis.\n\nNotably, the vegetations on the bioprosthetic valve were very large and presented just 2\u00a0months after the MVR. Fournier et\u00a0al (7) described a case of endocarditis attributed to an allergic reaction to a porcine bioprosthetic valve. Although a bovine, not a porcine, valve was implanted in our patient, a hypersensitivity reaction to the bovine bioprosthetic valve could be possible.\n\nInasmuch as our patient was adequately treated with anakinra, an interleukin-1 antagonist, extensive interleukin release of unknown origin triggering an innate immune response was thought to be causative of the endocarditis.\n\nFollow-Up\n\nTwenty-two months after the fifth MVR, transthoracic echocardiography has repeatedly shown a 5-mm large structure on the posterior annulus, which has been stable since the last TEE (Figure\u00a03D, Video 5) and has been considered to be a suture. To date, the patient is free of TIAs, atrial fibrillation, and dyspnea. The patient continues to use anakinra and has tapered off the prednisone dose to 5\u00a0mg daily.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe report a rare case of an ill-understood repetitive immune-mediated noninfectious endocarditis. On the basis of this case, we suggest considering treating\u00a0patients with an unexplained repetitive immune-mediated noninfectious endocarditis with high doses of prednisone initially and anakinra. Our case shows that, despite extensive diagnostic efforts, even in the current era it is sometimes challenging to establish a fitting diagnosis and consequently an appropriate treatment.\n\nFunding Support and Author Disclosures\n\nThe authors have reported that they have no relationships relevant to the contents of this paper to disclose.\n\nAppendix\n\nSupplemental Video 1\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography before the third mitral valve replacement, showing a partially disconnected mitral valve with massive transvalvular leakage.\n\nSupplemental Video 2\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography before the third mitral valve replacement, showing a 18-mm mobile vegetation attached to the mitral valve ring.\n\nSupplemental Video 3\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography before the fourth mitral valve replacement visualizing mobile and irregular vegetations on the anterior and posterior mitral valve ring.\n\nSupplemental Video 4\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography before the fifth mitral valve replacement, showing a very large (31-mm) irregular and mobile vegetation seemingly attached to both mitral valve leaflets.\n\nSupplemental Video 5\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography 2\u00a0weeks after fifth mitral valve replacement visualizing a small (5-mm) structure in the posterior annulus.\n\nSupplemental Table\u00a01 and Supplemental Figures\u00a01 and 2\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank all the medical staff who dedicated their time and effort to this case, specifically Prof. Dr. Meroni for performing the noncriteria assays for antiphospholipid syndrome, Dr. Pieter van Paassen for sharing an unexplained case of immune-mediated noninfectious endocarditis treated with cyclosporin, and Dr. Aryan Vink for providing the histology pictures.\n\nThe authors attest they are in compliance with human studies committees and animal welfare regulations of the authors\u2019 institutions and Food and Drug Administration guidelines, including patient consent where appropriate.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nChloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine Use and Suicide Risk: Hypotheses for Confluent Etiopathogenetic Mechanisms?\n\nABSTRACT:\nChloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are classical anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory treatments, which were used as first-line therapy at the beginning of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Besides the emerging data on their lack of efficacy against COVID-19 infection, such treatments have been associated with some severe health concerns, including those of neuropsychiatric nature, such as a possible increase in suicide risk. Here we report a case of a patient with no history of psychiatric illnesses, who abruptly developed depression with melancholic features, severe suicidal ideation (SI), and attempted suicide (SA) shortly after receiving HCQ for his COVID-19 infection. The case was followed by a mini-review of the heterogeneous scientific literature on the hypothetical association between neuropsychiatric symptoms, with a focus on SI and suicidal behavior (SB, including SA and death by suicide), when CQ and HCQ are used in COVID-19, rheumatologic diseases, and malaria settings. Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of CQ and HCQ and the implications for neuroinflammation in suicide pathogenesis, the possible increase in suicide risk caused by these medications appears paradoxical and suggests that other underlying pathological trajectories might account for this eventuality. In this regard, some of these latter mechanistic postulates were proposed. Certainly the role and contribution of psycho-social factors that a COVID-19 patient had to face can neither be minimized nor excluded in the attempt to understand his suffering until the development of SI/SB. However, while this case report represents a rare scenario in clinical practice and no consensus exists in the literature on this topic, a psychiatric screening for suicide risk in patients using of CQ and HCQ could be carefully considered.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1. Introduction\n\nChloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are 4-aminoquinoline-derived agents, initially developed as antimalarial drugs. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, both HCQ and CQ are also currently used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus [1]. These pharmacological agents are known to be responsible for a wide range of side effects, including retinopathies, myopathies, and cardiotoxicity [2,3,4]. Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric adverse events (AE) have also been reported in patients using CQ and HCQ since the early 1960s [5]. These AEs were first observed in travelers taking CQ or HCQ as antimalarials as well as in subjects without history of psychiatric illnesses. However, the role of premorbid vulnerability remains unclear in these cases.\n\nFollowing the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, medical researchers began investigating the role of CQ or HCQ as possible treatment for COVID-19. Given their in vitro antiviral activity against a clinical isolates of 2019-nCoV [6], both drugs were approved as emergency treatment for COVID-19 hospitalized patients by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) at the beginning of the pandemic [7,8]. However, in June 2020, based on the emerging scientific data which highlights an increased risk of serious AEs and a substantial lack of clinical efficacy in treating COVID-19 [9,10], the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) of CQ or HCQ as treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside of clinical trials [11]. Furthermore, with the widespread use of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 infections in many countries, concerns regarding their risk of neuropsychiatric AEs have been raised.\n\nIn light of this emerging health concern in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we described a case report and a mini-review on the current literature on psychiatric AEs signalized to the use of CQ and HCQ, with a particular focus on possible suicide risk (suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB), including suicide attempts (SA) and death by suicide) and their putative etiopathogenic mechanisms related to these drugs.\n\n2. Case Report\n\nA 54-year-old man was diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 infection during the first wave of the pandemic. The patient had a mildly elevated temperature (37.5 \u00b0C which did not require administration of paracetamol), reported an incomplete loss of taste and smell, and had no cardiac/pulmonary involvement. The infection did not result in any serious complications that required hospitalization and HCQ was prescribed (200 mg twice a day) by his general practitioner. The patient had no personal or family history of psychiatric illnesses as well as other somatic comorbidities, except for his diabetes mellitus type 2, which was treated with metformin. The patient had a supportive family and social network. He was neither directly affected by the sanitary emergency (such as bereavement) nor presented with any financial stressors (such as fear of job loss or status decline). He also did not report any concerns about his COVID-19 prognosis. After five days of HCQ treatment, the patient suddenly experienced depressive symptoms with melancholic features and severe SI. Subsequently, the patient attempted jumping off his balcony when he thought he was alone, but his SA was interrupted by his son.\n\nAfter his SA, the patient was hospitalized in a COVID-19 unit with constant surveillance and psychiatric consultations. The patient started receiving psychopharmacological treatment with sertraline 50 mg/day and olanzapine 5 mg/day. HCQ treatment was stopped. The initial dosing regimen of sertraline was scheduled to be increased in the following days. However, around one week after the discontinuation of HCQ, his psychiatric conditions progressively and significantly improved. Particularly, his severe depression subsided, and SI completely disappeared. Therefore, sertraline was not augmented as planned and olanzapine was reduced to 2.5 mg/day for one week and eventually withdrawn.\n\nIn retrospect, the patient described the events (including deep depressive suffering accompanied by SI and interrupted SA) that led him to the psychiatric hospitalization as a \u201cblack-out\u201d or a \u201cnightmare\u201d that began immediately after the initiation of HCQ treatment. He was discharged from the psychiatric unit and continued his psychiatric follow-up visits in an outpatient mental health service. His psychic conditions remained stable in the following months. After 1 year, sertraline was discontinued, without any reoccurrence of psychiatric symptoms.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nHere we report the case of a patient with no history of psychiatric illnesses, who developed a sudden major depressive episode with melancholic features, severe SI and SA, shortly after receiving HCQ for his COVID-19 infection. The rapid improvement in these neuropsychiatric symptoms coincided with the interruption of HCQ treatment. Sertraline was also introduced; however, the clinical efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) could only be detected after about 3 weeks of treatment. The severity of his major depressive episode with melancholic features and complete imperviousness to environmental positive inputs, suggested an important biological contribution to its origin. Furthermore, his psychiatric condition might not have an important psychosocial origin, as the patient experienced no stressors of socioeconomic or psychological nature and did not belong to more vulnerable populations [12,13,14], as those who were widely described in literature [15,16]. We considered the following differential diagnoses. (i) Major depression with melancholic characteristics, first depressive episode: this was discarded due to the sudden onset after introduction of HCQ and the unusually rapid resolution after cessation of HCQ; (ii) first major depressive episode in the context of a relatively late-onset bipolar disorder: this was discarded based on the same reasoning given in (i); moreover the longitudinal follow-up did not reveal any further hypomanic, manic, or depressive episode; (iii) onset of a cerebral lesion (e.g., brain tumor) or a neuro-degenerative disease (e.g., fronto-temporal dementia that is associated to SI and SB): they were excluded following neuroimaging and a psychometric evaluation; (iv) impact of psycho-sociological factors: this did not apply to our patient, whose relatives, closest friends, and family doctor stated that he was unconcerned by the prognosis, and also the patient himself reported in a sincere and authentic manner that he had no concerns about the prognosis, especially since it was immediately shown to be favorable; furthermore, the patient described himself as lucky from a somatic point of view compared to other patients with adverse prognoses; (v) impact of concerns, particularly the fear of death: this was discarded based on the same reasoning given in (iv). While it is not possible to rule out the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures as well as possible underlying fear of the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on the development of his psychiatric complications, considering the reciprocal interactions between biological and non-biological factors [17,18,19,20], non-biological factors seem largely insufficient to explain the chronology and severity of the presented depressive and suicidal symptomatology. Collectively, an HCQ AE at the basis of both severe depression and SI/SB could be hypothesized.\n\nCQ/HCQ have been associated with several neuropsychiatric AEs in rheumatic diseases, infectious diseases, and COVID-19 [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. These AEs can range from relatively mild psychiatric symptoms, such as irritability, nervousness, and insomnia, to intermediate and severe clinical conditions including adjustment disorder, anxiety also with pervasive features, \u201cpersonality change\u201d, major depression, psychosis, confusion, psycho-motor agitation, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29] (Table 1). Notably, some evidence of increased risk of SI/SB has been described [21,22,27,28]. This risk was particularly signalized among patients in co-treatment with metformin or elderly (possibly due to diminished neuronal reserve and presence of mixed neurodegenerative and vascular brain injuries) [23,26,30]. However, these findings have not been corroborated in other studies [24,25,28]. Of interest to its neuropsychiatric AEs, CQ/HCQ exhibits neurotropism as CQ level in the CNS was shown to be 10\u201330 times higher than its serum concentration after dosing [31]. This phenomenon might be attributed to the interaction of CQ with the P-glycoprotein at the blood\u2013brain barrier interface [32]. Since CQ and HCQ exhibit similar physiochemical properties, many pharmacokinetic features of HCQ are often inferred from CQ studies [1].. Given the neurotropic impact of CQ/HCQ, all studies recommend informing patients and their relatives about this possible increase in suicide risk without discouraging the necessary use of CQ/HCQ for the underlying pathological conditions [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29].\n\nSince markers of inflammation and dyslipidemia, such as CRP, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-a, and cholesterol levels, have been suggested as etiological risk factors of SI/SB development [33,34,35,36], the possible association of neuropsychiatric complications with CQ/HCQ, which exert potent anti-inflammatory [1] /anti-lipidemic properties [37,38] appears paradoxical and suggests that other underlying pathological mechanisms might account for these phenomena (Figure 1). In this regard, CQ and HCQ have been proposed to (i) induce neurochemical interference with calcium signaling in neural cells [39] as well as disruption of dopamine and acetylcholine homeostasis [40,41], and ultimately precipitating into neuropsychiatric symptoms, including suicide (Figure 1). Alternatively, several other well-documented side effects of HCQ might also potentiate the risk of developing neuropsychiatric AEs, particularly SI/SB. For instance, (ii) HCQ treatment can cause hypoglycemia [42], which could trigger dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and, subsequently, cortisol rhythm [43,44] (Figure 1). Notably, alterations in these signaling pathways have been associated with increased suicide risk [45,46,47]. (iii) Another side effect of HCQ is its cardiotoxicity, which has been mainly attributed to its impact on arrhythmia (QT interval prolongation) [4,48,49] (Figure 1). In this regard, heart diseases and abnormal heart rate variability have been suspected to be a risk factor for SI/SB development. Specifically, elevated suicide rates have been found in subjects with cardiac comorbidities of heart failure, cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, angina pectoris, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation and flutter [50]. In addition, root mean square of successive difference, a measurement of temporal variations in normal heart rhythms, and resting heart rate have been associated with moderate-to-high suicide risk, based on the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) suicide scores [51]. Therefore, it is plausible to postulate that HCQ-associated cardiotoxicity might augment the risk of suicide in patients receiving this medication. (iv) Last but not least, a novel drug-drug interaction has been identified between HCQ and metformin [23] (Figure 1). In a study of 10,771 case reports of safety concerns related to HCQ, metformin and HCQ coadministration was shown to result in fatal outcomes, particularly death by suicide. This observation is of particular relevance to the present case as the patient had been treated for his diabetes with metformin and therefore would be at a high risk for fatal outcomes, such as SI/SB. This adverse interaction has been hypothesized to be the result of autophagic inhibition by metformin/chloroquine as an increase in autophagosomes in hearts, livers, and kidneys of animals treated with these two medications was linked to their fatal toxicity [52]. Additionally, the synergy between metformin and HCQ might potentiate the risk of developing severe hypoglycemia, causing heightened HPA dysregulation and, ultimately, increasing suicide risk.\n\nAn important limitation of this case report is the consideration that a pandemic condition in itself may lead to SI and SB via several mostly psycho-social pathways, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), concerns (e.g., fear/worry of contracting the virus), pessimism, worthlessness, sleep problems, financial strain/insecurity, domestic violence, helplessness, isolation, loneliness, and disconnectedness [19,53]. In this context, we did not explicitly consider fear of death as a concern caused by the pandemic in the described patient. However, this was not an omission but a result of our assessment of the patient (see item (iv) in the differential diagnosis paragraph). While the important role of fear of death still remains relatively less analyzed and empathized among patients in analogy to what also occurs in other settings where the integrity of the person is threatened, such as emergency departments [54,55], more studies have investigated this concept in healthcare workers, typically in relation with hopelessness and PTSD [14,56]. We postulate that in the patient described, psychosocial stressors played a less relevant role than the chronological concomitance of symptomatology with HCQ intake as these factors appear to be extremely favorable from a psychological, social, and prognostic point of view. Nevertheless, the onset of psycho-social triggers and fear of death, when faced with an unexpected, unfamiliar condition with possible tragic consequences\u2014even if unexpressed\u2014cannot be excluded categorically in having contributed to the patient\u2019s SI and SA.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nOur case report highlights some infrequent, yet serious neuropsychiatric complications, including SI/SB, of HCQ in a COVID-19 patient. Certainly the role and contribution of non-biological factors that a COVID-19 patient had to face can neither be minimized nor excluded in the attempt to understand his suffering until the development of SI/SB. However, a psychiatric screening for suicide risk in patients using of CQ and HCQ could be carefully considered. While various biological factors related to the \u201coff-target\u201d effects of HCQ might be accountable for these AEs, further data are needed to provide unequivocal mechanistic insights into the risks associated with this controversial COVID-19 therapy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was developed within the framework of the DINOGMI Department of Excellence of MIUR 2018-2022 (Law 232/2016).\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, A.C., V.P., A.A.

Biochemical properties of HCQ/CQ can cause several side effects that might contribute to the development of SI/SB. Its accumulation in the brain can cause disruption of neurotransmitter signaling circuits involved in the pathogenesis of suicide. Its metabolic and cardiovascular impacts can result in abnormal cortisol release and arrythmia, both of which have been linked to increased suicide risk. The adverse interaction of HCQ/CQ with metformin might also precipitate in fatal neuropsychiatric outcomes.

However, CPA-associated severe enteritis is a rare adverse effect, and only one case with a lethal clinical course has been reported. Therefore, the appropriate management of patients with CPA-associated severe enteritis is unclear.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe present the case of a 61-year-old woman diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis based on the presence of symptoms in ear, lung, and, kidney with positive myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. She received pulsed methylprednisolone followed by prednisolone 55 mg/d and intravenous CPA at a dose of 500 mg/mo. Ten days after the second course of intravenous CPA, she developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was admitted to the hospital. Laboratory testing revealed hypoalbuminemia, suggesting protein-losing enteropathy. Computed tomography revealed wall thickening of the stomach, small intestine, and colon with contrast enhancement on the lumen side. Antibiotics and immunosuppressive therapy were not effective, and the patient's enteritis did not improve for > 4 mo. Because her condition became seriously exhausted, corticosteroids were tapered and supportive therapies including intravenous hyperalimentation, replenishment of albumin and gamma globulin, plasma exchange, and infection control were continued. These supportive therapies improved her condition, and her enteritis gradually regressed. She was finally discharged 7 mo later.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImmediate discontinuation of CPA and intensive supportive therapy are crucial for the survival of patients with CPA-associated severe enteritis.\n\nTEXT:\nCore Tip: Cyclophosphamide-associated enteritis is rare, but a fatal complication of the treatment for the vasculitides. This is the first successful report of the treatment for the severe cyclophosphamide-associated enteritis, and indicates the importance of immediate discontinuation of cyclophosphamide and intensive supportive therapy.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCyclophosphamide (CPA) is an alkylating agent that is frequently used in vasculitides as an induction therapy. Particularly in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, the addition of immunosuppressants is recommended for patients with a higher five-factor score[1]. CPA is metabolized into the active form in the liver and covalently binds to the nucleus[2]. Thereafter, it manifests antiproliferative effects by inhibiting deoxyribonucleic acid replication[2]. Although CPA has an established therapeutic effect in vasculitides, it sometimes results in adverse effects including myelosuppression, hemorrhagic cystitis, increased susceptibility to infection, and infertility[3]. However, the development of enteritis due to CPA use in patients with autoimmune diseases is rare, with only one case report in which Yang et al[4] presented a lethal case of CPA-associated enteritis in a patient with microscopic polyangiitis. Here, we report a severe case of CPA-associated enteritis in a patient who presented with prominent protein-losing enteropathy, who was successfully treated with supportive therapy including plasma exchange (PE).\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\n\nChief complaints\n\nA 61-year-old Japanese woman developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nHistory of present illness\n\nThree months before the first admission, she experienced nasal congestion, aural fullness, and auditory disturbance, and was diagnosed with otitis media. Also, two months before presentation, she experienced cough worsening, and chest radiography revealed a pulmonary infiltrative shadow. Two months before presentation, she was referred to our hospital for the evaluation of pulmonary consolidation with positive myeloperoxidase-ANCA (MPO-ANCA). She was admitted to the previous hospital. She had a body temperature of 38 \u00b0C and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL). Although she was treated with antibiotics, her symptoms, inflammatory markers, and chest infiltrates did not improve. Laboratory examination showed a high titer of MPO-ANCA (Table 1), and she was referred to our hospital. After admission, her creatinine level increased with proteinuria, glomerular hematuria, and granular casts, indicating the presence of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) was diagnosed on the basis of the presence of otitis media, sinusitis, pulmonary nodule, RPGN, and positive MPO-ANCA. She received pulsed methylprednisolone followed by prednisolone (PSL) 55 mg/d in combination with intravenous CPA at a dose of 500 mg/mo. Her condition significantly improved, and she was discharged 9 d after the second course of intravenous CPA when the PSL dose was 45 mg/d. She developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea the day after discharge, and was admitted to our hospital.\n\nTable 1 Laboratory findings\n\n\tFirst admission\tSecond admission\t\nUrinalysis\t\t\t\nProtein\t1+\t2+\t\nOccult blood\t1+\t-\t\nRed blood cell\t10-29/HPF1\t< 4/HPF\t\nCasts\t+2\t+3\t\nSpot protein-creatinine ratio (g/g Cr)\t0.38\t0.20\t\nWBC (/\u00b5L)\t14500\t6100\t\nHb (g/dL)\t10.9\t14.9\t\nPlt (104/\u00b5L)\t43.4\t35.1\t\nT-Bil (mg/dL)\t0.3\t0.8\t\nAST (U/L)\t25\t20\t\nALT (U/L)\t30\t18\t\n\u03b3-GTP (U/L)\t24\t18\t\nALP (U/L)\t239\t102\t\nLDH (U/L)\t207\t200\t\nCK (U/L)\t58\t37\t\nTP (g/dL)\t7.1\t4.3\t\nAlb (g/dL)\t2.6\t2.5\t\nBUN (mg/dL)\t11\t35\t\nCr (mg/dL)\t0.5\t0.7\t\nCRP (mg/dL)\t14.2\t0.2\t\nMPO-ANCA (U/mL)\t194.0\t1.0\t\n1 Deformed erythrocytes.\n\n2 Casts: waxy casts, leukocyte casts.\n\n3 Casts: granular casts.\n\nAlb: Albumin; ANCA: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; ALP: Alkaline phosphatase; ALT: Alanine aminotransferase; AST: Aspartate aminotransferase; BUN: Blood urea nitrogen; CK: Creatine kinase; Cr: Creatinine; CRP: C-reactive protein; Hb: Hemoglobin; HPF: High-power field; LDH: Lactate dehydrogenase; MPO: Myeloperoxidase; Plt: Platelets; T-Bil: Total bilirubin; TP: Total protein; WBC: White blood cells.\n\nHistory of past illness\n\nShe had been diagnosed with Grave\u2019s disease since the age of 40.\n\nPersonal and family history\n\nThe patient had no family history.\n\nPhysical examination\n\nOn admission, her consciousness was clear, body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C, and body pressure was 106/75 mmHg. Her abdomen was soft and flat, with pain in the left lower quadrant without defense or rebound tenderness.\n\nLaboratory examinations\n\nLaboratory testing indicated hypoalbuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, suggesting protein-losing enteropathy that resulted in the leakage of proteins from the gastrointestinal tract (Table 1).\n\nImaging examinations\n\nAbdominal radiography did not show niveau or free air. Computed tomography (CT) revealed wall thickening of the stomach, small intestine, and colon with contrast enhancement on the lumen side (Figure 1A). The contrast enhancement of the outer layer of the intestine was poor, indicating edematous change. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed edematous thickening of the stomach and diffusely distributed erosion throughout the descending duodenum (Figure 1B). Colonoscopy showed generalized edema and depression with erythema, mainly at the end of the ileum. The depression had no ulcerated surface.\n\nFigure 1 Clinical images on admission. A and B: Computed tomography scans of the abdomen showing diffuse wall thickening of the stomach, small intestine, and colon; C and D: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy images showing diffuse erosion throughout the descending duodenum; E and F: Colonoscopy images showing generalized edema and depression with erythema mainly at the end of the ileum.\n\nFurther diagnostic work-up\n\nBiopsy showed the absence of malignancy and vasculitis, as well as neoplastic changes including hyperplasia. Mild inflammatory cellular infiltration and some granulation tissues and ulcers were present. Cytomegalovirus staining was negative. Because the differential diagnoses included infectious enteritis, GPA-associated gastroenteritis, and drug-induced enteritis, the patient was initially treated with antibiotics including meropenem. However, hypoalbuminemia progressed. Therefore, we replenished albumin and gamma globulin and performed PE. Her condition did not improve, and her serum albumin levels remained approximately 1.5 mg/dL for > 1 mo. This clinical course ruled out the presence of an infectious etiology. Therefore, we decided to augment immunosuppression, and increased the PSL dose to 60 mg/d and added tacrolimus. Nevertheless, the enteritis did not respond to these treatments, which was contradictory to the autoimmune phenomenon, including GPA-associated enteritis. At this point, infectious and vasculitic etiologies were unlikely.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS\n\nThe CPA-associated enteropathy was considered, as previously reported by Yang et al[4].\n\nTREATMENT\n\nBecause her condition became seriously exhausted, we tapered the steroid dose and continued supportive therapy including intravenous hyperalimentation, albumin supplementation, PE, and infection control (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Clinical course. Alb: Albumin; IV CPA: Intravenous cyclophosphamide; mPSL: Methylprednisolone; PE: Plasma exchange; PSL: Prednisolone; TAC: Tacrolimus.\n\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\nThe supportive therapies improved the patient\u2019s condition, and her enteritis gradually regressed (Figure 3). She was finally discharged 7 mo after the second admission and underwent rehabilitation. At 2 years from discharge, she is now in complete remission and has returned to her previous work.\n\nFigure 3 Improvement of computed tomography findings. The computed tomography images were taken at different time points after the second hospitalization, as indicated.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe present case was complicated with severe enteritis, which was considered to be an adverse effect of CPA. Although the patient had severe protein-losing enteropathy, her condition was improved by aggressive supportive therapies with repeated administrations of albumin and globulin for several months.\n\nCPA is one of the frequently used immunosuppressant drugs for vasculitidis. Gastrointestinal involvement of GPA is one of the conditions requiring CPA[5]. However, CPA-associated enteritis is very rare, and there exists only one case describing a lethal course in a patient with GPA[4].\n\nWhen the present patient manifested abdominal symptoms, her vasculitis was in remission, which was supported by the absence of ear symptoms, normal urinalysis, normal inflammatory marker levels, and negative MPO-ANCA. In addition, there were no histologic signs of vasculitis, granulomatous colitis, or gastritis in biopsy tissues. Further, treatment with immunosuppressants did not improve her condition, which was similar to the previously described case[4,6-8]. In addition, the blood culture, fecal culture, Clostridium difficile toxin, and cytomegalovirus tests were all negative. Because it was possible that these test results were false negative, antibiotics were administered, which did not improve the enteritis.\n\nThe mechanisms by which CPA causes enteritis are not well defined. In the field of oncology, CPA is likely to be associated with gastrointestinal involvement and mucositis, which may be related to the gut microbiota[9]. In a mouse model, Viaud et al[10] reported that CPA altered the microbiota composition in the small intestine and induced the translocation of selected species of gram-positive bacteria into secondary lymphoid organs.\n\nWe compared the clinical characteristics between the present case and the previous case. In the present case, symptoms appeared 38 d after the first intravenous CPA (500 mg/mo), whereas the previous case showed symptoms 2 wk after the start of oral CPA (100 mg/d). Therefore, the cumulative dose of CPA at the onset of symptoms was 1 g in the present case and 1.4 g in the previous case. Gastrointestinal lesions were distributed in the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, and colon in the present case, whereas they were limited to the small bowel and colon in the previous case. In the present case, CT showed massive wall thickening with prominent contrast enhancement in the mucosa. The outer layer showed edematous thickening. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed edematous thickening of the stomach and diffusely distributed erosion throughout the descending duodenum. Colonoscopy showed generalized edema from the transverse colon to the rectum. The clinical imaging findings in the previous case were similar to the diffuse mural thickening on CT and denuded and erythematous mucosa on endoscopy in the present case.\n\nThe difference from the previous report was that the present patient survived with intensive supportive therapy. In the previous case, CPA was continued for 1 mo with reduction to 50 mg/d after the complication of enteritis appeared, and then stopped. Therefore, the patient received 2.1 g CPA in total. In the present case, intravenous CPA was immediately stopped after the development of abdominal symptoms and the patient received 1 g CPA in total. Whether the cumulative dose of CPA influences the length of enteritis is uncertain, but the lower total CPA dose may be one of the reasons for the survival of the present patient. Nonetheless, this case confirmed that enteritis could develop not only with oral administration but also with intravenous injection of CPA.\n\nWith respect to treatment, no specific therapy exists for CPA-induced enteritis. However, the associated tissue injury is severe and can last for months, resulting in the loss of serum proteins including albumin and gamma globulin. Therefore, aggressive supportive therapies including hyperalimentation, replenishment of albumin and gamma globulin, and PE in severe cases are important. Because continuation of CPA is difficult in patients who experienced CPA-induced enteritis, rituximab or azathioprine can be the alternative treatment for GPA.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, severe enteritis is a rare but life-threatening adverse effect of CPA. Immediate discontinuation of CPA and persistent supportive treatment are crucial for survival.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors thank the staff of the department of hematology and rheumatology, Tohoku University, for helpful discussions.\n\nInformed consent statement: Written informed consent for the publication of this case report was obtained from the patient.\n\nConflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nCARE Checklist (2016) statement: The authors have read the CARE Checklist (2016), and the manuscript was prepared and revised according to the CARE Checklist (2016).\n\nManuscript source: Unsolicited manuscript\n\nPeer-review started: January 25, 2021\n\nFirst decision: February 27, 2021\n\nArticle in press: May 7, 2021\n\nSpecialty type: Gastroenterology and hepatology\n\nCountry/Territory of origin: Japan\n\nPeer-review report\u2019s scientific quality classification\n\nGrade A (Excellent): A\n\nGrade B (Very good): B, B\n\nGrade C (Good): C, C\n\nGrade D (Fair): 0\n\nGrade E (Poor): 0\n\nP-Reviewer: Abe Y, Mattar MC, Rawat K S-Editor: Zhang L L-Editor: A P-Editor: Li JH",

Respiratory failure prompted hospitalization for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result was positive; the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody test result was negative. Remdesivir and dexamethasone resulted in partial improvement. Fever persisted until day 13. The patient was transitioned to room air on day\u00a018.\n\nFever and intermittent dyspnea recurred on day 19. The result of repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was negative; the IgG antibody test result became positive. On day 22, the infant\u2019s distal extremities demonstrated peeling. An echocardiogram revealed giant left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery (6.1\u00a0mm; z-score\u00a0+22) and large right coronary artery (RCA) aneurysms; the left main and circumflex coronary arteries were dilated (Figures\u00a02A to 2F).Figure\u00a02 Early Cardiac Imaging (Patient 1)\n\nEchocardiography (day 21) showing (A) a giant (z-score\u00a0+26) left anterior descending artery aneurysm and (B) a large (z-score\u00a0+8.5) right coronary artery aneurysm (arrow).

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), pulse intravenous methyl-prednisolone (IVMP) (days 22-24), enoxaparin, and aspirin were started. By day 23, he was afebrile.\n\nCardiac computed tomography (day 24) also demonstrated coronary involvement, with possible LAD artery mural thrombus (Figures\u00a02A to 2F, Video 1). He received infliximab 10\u00a0mg/kg. Clopidogrel was added. An echocardiogram (day 26) showed coronary aneurysm enlargement. On the basis of improved clinical features and laboratory values, he was discharged.\n\nCardiac magnetic resonance imaging (day 90) showed LAD, circumflex, and distal RCA size improvement, whereas the mid-RCA aneurysm diameter was 1\u00a0mm larger (Figures\u00a03A to 3C). He remains asymptomatic on prednisolone and triple anticoagulation.Figure\u00a03 Follow-Up Cardiac Imaging (Patient 1)\n\nMagnetic resonance angiography images showing (A) a giant proximal left anterior descending artery aneurysm (arrow), (B) a proximal and distal right coronary artery aneurysm(arrow), and (C) a proximal left circumflex artery aneurysm (arrow).\n\nPatient 2\n\nA 2-year-old male child presented with dehydration following 2\u00a0days of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, rash, and palmoplantar erythema and edema. On day 4, the SARS-CoV2 PCR result was negative, and the IgG antibody test result was positive. An echocardiogram (day 5) showed normal findings. MIS-C was diagnosed. Treatment with IVMP, IVIG, and enoxaparin was instituted.\n\nHypotension and desaturations during IVIG infusion required transfer to intensive care and a low-flow nasal cannula. Pulse IVMP was initiated (days 7-9) for persistent fever. By day 9, he was on room air, hemodynamically stable, and afebrile. An\u00a0echocardiogram (day 12) showed mild RCA and left main coronary artery dilation; therapy was not escalated given his improved clinical manifestations and laboratory values. He was discharged on a prednisolone taper and aspirin.\n\nOn day 31 he was readmitted with fever and bilateral hip pain and effusions. An echocardiogram revealed giant RCA (7.6\u00a0mm; z-score\u00a0+17) and moderate left main coronary aneurysms (Figures\u00a04A to 4F). He received IVMP pulses (days 31-33), anakinra (2 doses), infliximab 5\u00a0mg/kg, and enoxaparin. By day 32 fever resolved. An echocardiogram on day 33 showed worsening coronary changes prompting redosing with infliximab 5\u00a0mg/kg. Clopidogrel was started.Figure\u00a04 Early Cardiac Imaging (Patient 2)\n\nEchocardiography (day 31) showing (A) a large (z-score\u00a0+5) left main coronary artery aneurysm (arrow) at the bifurcation and (B) a giant (z-score\u00a0+17) proximal right coronary artery aneurysm (arrow).

The SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was negative; the IgG antibody test result was positive. MIS-C was diagnosed. IVIG and enoxaparin were started. An echocardiogram (day 6) showed mild RCA dilation prompting IVMP initiation.\n\nOn days 7 to 8, hypotension, altered mental status, and respiratory failure developed, requiring noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and transfer to intensive care. An echocardiogram (day 9) revealed severely depressed left ventricular function (ejection fraction 35%) that required epinephrine and milrinone administration. IVIG was redosed.\n\nOn day 9, extreme agitation led to intubation for optimized sedation. Out of concern for ongoing inflammation, anakinra was started. Aspirin was initiated. Fever subsided by day 13. She was extubated by day 14; vasoactive drugs were discontinued by day 15. Anakinra and corticosteroids were gradually decreased until day\u00a017.\n\nOn day 18, an echocardiogram demonstrated large LAD artery and moderate RCA aneurysms. She received tocilizumab; anakinra was discontinued. On day 20, an echocardiogram and cardiac computed tomography (Figures\u00a05A to 5F, Video 3) showed further LAD artery enlargement with giant aneurysm formation (8\u00a0mm; z-score\u00a0+10.1); anakinra was restarted.Figure\u00a05 Early Cardiac Imaging (Patient 3)\n\nEchocardiography (day 22) showing (A) moderate (z-score\u00a0+4) left main coronary artery dilation (arrow), a proximal aneurysm (z-score\u00a0+12) of the left anterior descending artery, and (B) mild (z-score\u00a0+3.9) right coronary artery dilation (arrow).

(F) A 3-dimensional reconstruction of coronary architecture.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe report 3 cases of giant coronary aneurysms secondary to MIS-C. MIS-C has been associated with cardiac complications in up to 87% of cases, manifesting as various degrees of myocardial dysfunction, pericardial effusion, arrhythmias, valvulopathies, and/or coronary artery involvement. Coronary artery aneurysms and dilation, usually mild or moderately sized, occur in 6% to 24% of cases (1, 2, 3). The z-score, a\u00a0normalized measurement of coronary artery diameter on the basis of body surface area, and diameter in\u00a0millimeters are used to classify coronary dilation and aneurysms by size. Reports of giant coronary aneurysms (z-score\u00a0\u226510 or diameter \u22658\u00a0mm) in MIS-C are scarce (4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Patient 1 is the youngest case of MIS-C\u2013related giant coronary aneurysms described to date.\n\nGiven the broad definition of MIS-C (Table\u00a01), distinguishing between MIS-C and alternative diagnoses can be difficult, as exemplified by patient 1, whose therapy initially targeted acute coronavirus disease-19, and the determination of MIS-C depended on coronary abnormalities and seroconversion. Differentiating between Kawasaki disease (KD) and MIS-C is particularly challenging, considering that up to 64% of patients with MIS-C meet criteria for complete or atypical KD, as did our cases (2). KD was a consideration for our patients, more so for Patient 1 given his age. However, African and Hispanic heritage and gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms are features more frequent in MIS-C than in KD, and their presence favored MIS-C in our cases (9). Our patients\u2019 respiratory compromise and need for intensive care are also uncommon in KD. Laboratory parameters, including higher C-reactive protein levels, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia, may help differentiate MIS-C from KD (3,9). Interestingly, all our patients exhibited thrombocytosis at the time of giant coronary aneurysm diagnosis or evolution, despite initial thrombocytopenia (Patients 2 and 3). Laboratory value measurements in relation to the time of development of coronary changes have not been analyzed and warrant further exploration. Similarly, predictors of complications in MIS-C remain under investigation. Mucocutaneous manifestations and severe inflammation, as observed in our patients, have been proposed as risk factors for coronary abnormalities in MIS-C, along with conjunctival injection and higher peak interleukin-6 and pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide levels (3,5,7,10).\n\nData from randomized trials addressing therapy-based outcomes for MIS-C are lacking. Given the similarities between MIS-C and KD, their management also overlaps. Corticosteroids, IVIG, and biologic agents have been used in MIS-C management (2,3,7,9). IVIG and/or corticosteroids are favored as first-line therapy, especially in patients with KD-like features, although a protective effect of IVIG against adverse coronary outcomes has not been established in MIS-C (9). Importantly, coronary aneurysms developed in Patients 2 and 3 after IVIG administration. Furthermore, clinical status was not predictive of echocardiographic aneurysm progression in our patients; thus, serial echocardiography proved essential in their management.\n\nAs evidenced by our case series, the use of biologic agents for MIS-C has not been standardized. Infliximab has been used for MIS-C\u2013related aneurysms, with partial or complete reversibility of the coronary changes (4,5,7). Interleukin-1 (anakinra) and interleukin-6 (tocilizumab) blockade has been used in refractory MIS-C; these agents were used successfully in Patient 3 (2). Multicenter studies are needed to determine the most effective therapies for MIS-C. Long-term outcomes are still to be determined, and multispecialty follow-up is essential.\n\nFunding Support and Author Disclosures\n\nDr. Prahalad has received partial support from the Marcus Foundation Inc.; and has served on a Macrophage Activation Syndrome Adjudication Committee for Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

There have been few case reports of contrast medium-induced immune hemolytic anemia. Here, we report a case of a 70-year-old woman who was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. She had a CT abdomen and pelvis using iohexol (omnipaque), which resulted in severe hemolytic anemia and contributed to the patient's death. This case illustrates a very rare complication of IV contrast medium that may result in death.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nDrug-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) is relatively rare, may go undiagnosed in many cases, and the magnitude of hemolysis can vary widely [1]. Drugs may induce the formation of antibodies against red blood cell (RBC) membrane or intrinsic RBC antigen, which may induce immune-mediated hemolysis. The incidence of DIIHA is approximately 1 per million/year [2].\u00a0More than 130 drugs have been associated with DIIHA but the most commonly reported include cephalosporins, diclofenac, rifampicin, oxaliplatin, and fludarabine [3].\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 70-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH) with a cough, shortness of breath, and fever of five days duration. Her medical background included ischemic stroke with severe disability (modified Rankin scale 5/6), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, severe osteoarthritis, and atrial fibrillation. Her regular medications were quetiapine (25 mg BID), amlodipine (5 mg daily), esomeprazole (20 mg daily), glargine insulin (20 units at night), metformin (500 mg BID), bisoprolol (5mg daily), spironolactone (25 mg daily), and ferrous sulfate (200 mg daily).\n\nOn examination, the patient appeared sick and confused. Her vitals were as follows: temperature 37.2 \u00b0C, blood pressure 96/25 mmHg, pulse 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate 40/minute, and oxygen saturation 50% on ambient air.

Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\n\nLaboratory findings are presented in Table 1.

The patient was intubated, mechanically ventilated, and started on IV antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and azithromycin). She also required vasopressors for the management of her septic shock. Despite antibiotics, she remained febrile for the following 48 hours after; therefore, piperacillin/tazobactam was upgraded to meropenem. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was done to look for an intraabdominal source of sepsis or hepatic vein thrombosis given the grossly deranged liver function test. The scan showed bilateral basal pulmonary consolidation and fatty liver without any other significant finding.\u00a0Fourteen hours following the CT scan with IV contrast, her hemoglobin dropped from 10.6 to 7.6 g/dL (normal 11-14.4). There was no evidence of active bleeding. A blood film was performed, and it revealed normocytic normochromic red cells with anisocytosis, polychromia, bite cell, blister cells, acanthocytes, highly toxic neutrophils, and there were no fragmented cells. Other hemolytic workups were suggestive of active intravascular hemolysis (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Hemolytic work-up results.\n\nG6PD:\u00a0glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, SLA/LP:\u00a0soluble liver antigen/liver-pancreas, LC-1:\u00a0liver cytosol antigen type 1, AMA-M2: anti-mitochondrial\u00a0M2\u00a0antibody, LKM-1:\u00a0liver-kidney microsome type\u00a01, gp210:\u00a0glycoprotein-210, PML: promyelocytic leukemia.\n\n\u00a0\tResult\tNormal range\t\nReticulocyte count %\t4.6\t0.5-1.5\t\nLactate dehydrogenase (U/L)\t5970\t135-214\t\nHaptoglobin (g/L)\t<0.1\t0.3-2\t\nPlatelets count (109/L)\t118\t150-450\t\nG6PD\t40-70% activity\t\u00a0\t\naPTT (second)\t46.1\t25.6-37.7\t\nPT (second)\t16.4\t10.5-12.7\t\nINR\t1.47\t0.92-1.08\t\nFibrinogen (g/L)\t3.9\t1.7-3.6\t\nBilirubin\t89\t0-17\t\nDirect anti-globulin test\tPositive for IgG\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\nMycoplasma serology\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\nAnti-SLA/LP\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\nAnti-LC-1\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\nAMA-M2\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\nAnti-Ro52\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\nAnti-LKM-1\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\nAnti-gp210\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\nAnti-PML\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\nAnti-Sp100\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\n3E (BPO)\tNegative\t\u00a0\t\n\nThe patient was supported with blood transfusion, and despite that, unfortunately, she had a severe hemolysis course, which led to a further drop in her hemoglobin to 4 g/dL (normal 11-14.4). Her course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. The patient\u2019s condition deteriorated further, and she had cardiopulmonary arrest 48 hours after receiving IV contrast, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe patient was admitted with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Her intensive unit care admission was complicated by a severe course of hemolysis leading to patient deterioration. The differential diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in this clinical context included disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency-induced hemolysis, and autoimmune hepatitis. However, normal fibrinogen level, blood film findings, negative autoimmune hepatitis screening largely excluded these differential diagnoses.\u00a0The clinical presentation with cough and fever, deranged liver enzymes, and the positive direct anti-globulin test could be explained by the\u00a0Ebstein\u00a0Bar virus, which unfortunately was not tested. However, the early onset of severe hemolysis, absence of lymphocytosis or lymphopenia, and the absence of other clinical features, including inflamed throat, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, were against infective mononucleosis. Mycoplasma pneumonia can cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia; however, the clinical presentation and the negative mycoplasma serology test made this possibility unlikely\u00a0[4]. The patient received piperacillin/tazobactam for the first 48 hours; however, hemolysis's abrupt onset followed the cessation of piperacillin/tazobactam made it an unlikely differential diagnosis.\n\nThe patient did not receive any of the medications which are known to be associated with DIIHA. It was evident that the patient developed a severe hemolysis course within hours after receiving 100 ml of iohexol (omnipaque) contrast, which makes contrast-induced immune intravascular hemolysis is the likely diagnosis\u00a0[5].\n\nNonimmune hyperosmolar contrast-induced sickling and hemolysis were described in a patient with sickle cell disease following coronary angiography\u00a0[6]. Only three cases of contrast medium induced immune intravascular hemolysis were reported in medical literature [2,7,8]. One patient developed severe hemolysis after the injection of Isopaque, an older ionic contrast medium, and serologic studies provided evidence for immunoglobulin (Ig)M, whereas the other two patients had intravascular hemolysis after administration of iomeprol contrast medium\u00a0[2,8]. Drug-induced immune hemolysis (drug-dependent type) is the most likely explanation of the hemolysis in our case, evidenced by the abrupt severe hemolysis after the administration of iohexol (omnipaque), the positive DAT (IgG class), and the absence of other factors explaining the sever onset hemolysis. Cessation of the culprit drug and blood products transfusion are the main aspects in the management of drug-induced hemolytic anemia\u00a0[9]. Steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasmapheresis, or immunosuppressants may be tried in refractory cases\u00a0[10,11].\n\nWe report the first case report of severe immune-mediated hemolytic anemia precipitated by iohexol administration (omnipaque). Unfortunately, severe hemolytic anemia may have contributed to patient deterioration and death.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis case reports the first case of iohexol (contrast media) induced immune hemolytic anemia in a critically sick patient. It highlights a very rare but serious complication of contrast medium. Contrast-induced immune hemolytic anemia should be known to clinicians and considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained hemolysis after administration of contrast media.\n\nHuman Ethics\n\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study",

He also developed polyarthritis and pitting pedal edema. Blood tests showed no specific autoantibodies and were negative for human leukocyte antigens B51, B15, and B27. Lower extremity venous ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography showed no vascular disorders. Skin biopsy showed no evidence of thrombosis or vasculitis. Direct fluorescence antibody analysis showed no antibody or complement deposition. Joint ultrasonography showed mild synovial thickening and/or synovial effusion in the extremities. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical steroids were administered, followed by oral steroids. However, the signs and symptoms did not improve. Oral steroids were discontinued, and colchicine (0.5 mg/day) was administered. Thereafter, the symptoms of arthritis improved, and no skin rash developed. In potentially inflammatory conditions with skin rash, edema, and polyarthritis that are difficult to diagnose, low-dose colchicine administration may be considered for prompt relief of symptoms.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nAdvances in medicine continue to decipher the etiology and pathophysiology of many previously unexplained diseases. However, in some patients, establishing a definitive diagnosis is difficult, even if necessary physical examination, blood tests, or imaging studies were adequately performed.1,2 Approximately 7%\u221235% of patients with unknown fever cannot be precisely diagnosed, and treatment may be initiated before a definitive diagnosis is established. 3 In general outpatient clinics, 25%\u221275% of patients complain of medically unexplained physical symptoms, 4 some of which may be due to unknown diseases. 5\n\nColchicine, an alkaloid originally extracted from the autumn crocus plant, is an inexpensive and potent anti-inflammatory drug for gout.6,7 It is also prescribed in familial Mediterranean fever, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, and pericarditis. Colchicine is thought to act by preventing leukocyte adhesion, mobility, and cytokine production through inhibiting tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory effects.8,9\n\nHerein, we present an undiagnosed patient with multiple symptoms and findings, including skin rash, arthritis, pitting edema of the extremities, and inflammation that responded significantly to low-dose colchicine treatment, following ineffective treatment with steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nCase\n\nA 54-year-old man with a history of alcoholic liver dysfunction and gout was referred to our hospital with rashes on his extremities (Figure 1). Five years ago, the patient had small and linear painful erythema on both lower limbs. Treatment was started with NSAIDs and topical steroids. However, the rash did not improve. Three years ago, a dermatologist suspected the patient to have erythema nodosum and/or thrombophlebitis. A year later, oral steroids were added at initial doses of 25 mg/day of prednisolone and continued at 5\u221220 mg/day as a maintenance dose according to symptoms. However, the symptoms did not improve. Skin rashes appeared solely along the superficial veins of the lower limbs over the sites touching footwear (boots), especially after standing in the afternoon. A year ago, similar skin rashes appeared on his upper limbs, along with pain, edema, and morning stiffness of both fingers, and he could not put on his ring. Subsequently, he began to experience pitting pedal edema and pain around the toes and heels (Figure 2).The symptoms of the affected joints were never in complete remission for more than a year without obvious joint swelling with erythema. He had no fever, weight loss, respiratory symptoms, impaired blood flow to the extremities, tophi, stomatitis, genital ulcers, folliculitis, or ocular symptoms.\n\nFigure 1. Skin rash in the patient. The rash started with erythema, followed by purpura and pigmentation. Non-palpable purpura and pigmentation on the patient\u2019s shoulder are shown (left). Non-palpable purpura and pigmentation on the superficial vein of the patient\u2019s lower leg are shown (right).\n\nFigure 2. Area of point tenderness. Tender points on the patient\u2019s hands and feet are shown (black dots).\n\nLower extremity venous ultrasonography showed no thrombus. Lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography showed no arterial occlusive lesions or arteriovenous shunting. Skin biopsy showed no evidence of thrombosis or vasculitis. Direct fluorescence antibody analysis showed no antibody or complement deposition. The disease\u2019s etiology remained unknown despite a detailed examination, and the patient was referred to our hospital. Dermatologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatologists, endocrinologists, and general practitioners participated in a multidisciplinary approach to the patient\u2019s diagnosis and treatment. At the first visit to our hospital (Table 1), blood tests showed mild abnormalities in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, with alcoholic liver damage and hypoproteinemia. He had been administered febuxostat 10 mg/day for hyperuricemia for years, and his uric acid level was within the reference range. No specific autoantibodies were found. A chest radiograph showed no pulmonary hilar lymph node enlargement. Moreover, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram showed no cardiac abnormalities. Plain radiographs of the hands and feet showed no signs of joint space narrowing or erosions. Joint ultrasonography showed mild synovial thickening and/or synovial effusion (grade 1 in all affected joints) in bilateral fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle, and toe. Hyperechoic spots in the synovium and double contour sign, which are gout characteristics, were not detected. Doppler ultrasonography showed mild blood flow signals only in the synovium of bilateral shoulder joints. Reexamination of the skin biopsy showed only hemorrhages and edema, with no specific findings. No human leukocyte antigen (HLA) specific to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, such as B51, B15, and B27, was found. First, recommendations for abstaining from alcohol and improving diet were provided as alcoholic liver disorders treatment. The previously prescribed oral steroids were tapered off and discontinued, and colchicine 0.5 mg/day was initiated for the treatment of polyarthritis. After taking low-dose colchicine, the patient noticed a gradual improvement in pain in his extremities. No acute toxicity due to colchicine was observed. After approximately 1\u2009month of colchicine treatment, the patients\u2019 subjective symptoms of arthritis improved such that the pain intensity decreased to nearly one-third of the pre-treatment value. The patient could put on his ring without difficulty, and his weight decreased from 64 to 62 kg. In addition, no new-onset skin rash was observed. After 6\u2009months of colchicine treatment, CRP levels were normalized (Table 2), and the joint pain nearly disappeared; the patient only reported mild stiffness in the hand for brief periods in the morning, so he was able to lead a normal life.\n\nTable 1.

First, physicians need to treat symptoms appropriately, regardless of causes, even if these are medically unexplained symptoms. 10 In Japan, blood tests, ultrasonography, and biopsy are all covered by the Japanese national public health insurance. Some undiagnosed cases are referred to the Initiative on Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases led by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development for genetic analyses. 11 This facility is not easily available in all regions of Japan. In our patient, a multidisciplinary approach was used to diagnose possible diseases, such as chronic gout, thrombophlebitis, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, coagulopathy, nutritional disturbances, and substance abuse. Although treatment should ideally be started before establishing definitive diagnoses, physicians are often reluctant to begin it. It has been reported that symptomatic relief for even acute abdominal diseases does not delay in diagnosis.12,13 Since definitive or effective treatment does not always exist, the goal of treatment should be to provide symptomatic relief and improve daily activities. 5\n\nSecond, colchicine could be effective in undiagnosed disease patients complaining of skin rashes, polyarthritis, and edema, especially those with some features similar to autoinflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Colchicine is reported to be effective in many diseases, including recurrent polychondritis, 14 pyoderma gangrenosum, 15 adult-onset Still\u2019s disease, 16 interstitial pneumonia, 17 pericarditis, gout, and familial Mediterranean fever. Possible diagnoses of these diseases were ruled out in our case. The efficacy of low-dose colchicine in preventing cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction has also been reported, 6 and its anti-inflammatory effect on atherosclerosis is currently anticipated. Colchicine is not a common treatment choice for various inflammatory arthritis that is difficult to classify. For example, patients with early persistent undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis and evaluated as being at risk of persistent arthritis are recommended to receive disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as early as possible (ideally within three months). These treatments might be administered even if patients do not meet the inflammatory rheumatologic disease criteria, and colchicine is not considered a therapeutic option. 18 The guidelines for undifferentiated spondyloarthritis include DMARDs, NSAIDs, and steroids as treatment options, and colchicine is not considered a treatment choice. 19 Even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, colchicine may improve symptoms and contribute to improving the quality of life in cases with suspected abnormalities in leukocyte function or cytokine production as the pathophysiology.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe presented an undiagnosed patient with main symptoms of skin rash, polyarthritis, and edema. In potentially inflammatory conditions that are difficult to classify, low-dose colchicine administration could be effective in symptomatic treatment.\n\nAuthor contributions: H.M. conceived the idea and wrote the original draft of the manuscript.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nAplastic Anemia in a Patient with Cronkhite-Canada Syndrome.\n\nABSTRACT:\nCronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare polyposis disorder accompanied by alopecia and onychodystrophy. A 63-year-old man with a history of CCS and repeated embolism developed progressive thrombocytopenia and mild anemia. Laboratory testing, a bone marrow examination, and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine resulted in a diagnosis of concurrent aplastic anemia (AA). Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)-type cells were detected in a peripheral blood specimen. In addition, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) included DRB1*15:01 and DRB1*15:02. Mesalazine was discontinued in consideration of possible drug-induced pancytopenia. Immunosuppressive therapy ameliorated both the gastrointestinal symptoms of CCS and pancytopenia. A common autoimmune abnormality might underlie both CCS and AA.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nCronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare, non-inherited gastrointestinal polyposis syndrome first described by Cronkhite and Canada in 1955 (1). Typical characteristics are generalized polyposis, pigmentation, alopecia, and onychodystrophy. Individuals of Asian descent (including Japanese) are the most commonly affected, with a median age at the onset of 59 years old (2).\n\nThis rare disease is considered to involve multiple causative factors, but none are definitive, and none have been confirmed in large-scale studies (3). An autoimmune etiology is plausible, as some cases of CCS are associated with antinuclear antibodies and show positive immunostaining for immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 (4,5). Aplastic anemia (AA) is also thought to be caused by immune-mediated hematopoietic suppression (6,7).\n\nWe herein report a case of CCS with AA complicated by recurrent thromboembolic events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe AA concomitant with CCS.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 57-year-old man visited a local hospital complaining of right lower leg pain, malaise, and dyspnea. Computed tomography revealed deep vein thrombosis in the right lower leg and bilateral pulmonary emboli. Anticoagulant therapy was initiated and successfully eliminated the emboli. During hospitalization, occult blood was detected in stools and colonoscopy was therefore performed. A tentative diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) was made, and mesalazine was commenced.\n\nHowever, one month later, atypical manifestations of dysgeusia, alopecia, pruritis, and peripheral neuropathy emerged. Unresolved diarrhea and hypo-albuminemia also appeared. Mesalazine was discontinued as a possible cause of adverse effects, especially concerning liver dysfunction. Repeated colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an edematous and reddish mucosa and numerous polypoid lesions (Fig. 1). A biopsy specimen from the terminal ileum showed infiltration of the edematous mucosa by various inflammatory cells. The diagnosis was changed from UC to a definitive diagnosis of CCS according to the clinical manifestations and pathological findings.\n\nFigure 1. Endoscopic findings. A) Small villous polyposis throughout the lower gastrointestinal tract. B) Numerous inflammatory polyps proliferating in the lining of the stomach.\n\nThe patient received prednisolone (PSL) at 60 mg/day, which gradually mitigated the bloody diarrhea and dysgeusia. Repeated endoscopy revealed reduced numbers of polyps in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Annual follow-up endoscopy was scheduled. PSL was deliberately tapered, but decreasing the dose to <4 mg/day led to difficulty controlling the gastrointestinal symptoms. Eventually, to avoid side effects of corticosteroid therapy, mesalazine was added as combination therapy for CCS when PSL was reduced to 15 mg/day. PSL was finally tapered to 2 mg/day in combination with mesalazine at 2,000 mg/day, with no recurrence of liver dysfunction.\n\nTwo years later, the patient developed sudden left-sided paralysis and aphasia, accompanied by dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a pale, nodular lesion in the dentate nucleus of the right cerebellum. In addition, multiple cerebral infarctions were noted in the left frontal lobe and cerebral hemispheres and were considered signs of previous, repeated asymptomatic strokes. Anticoagulant therapy was switched from warfarin to edoxaban.\n\nFive years after the CCS diagnosis, a routine visit revealed progressive thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and mild anemia. The laboratory parameters were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 9.6 g/dL [normal range (NR) 13.7-16.8 g/dL]; reticulocyte count, 51.1\u00d7109/L (NR 29.0-92.3\u00d7109/L); white blood cell (WBC) count, 3.6\u00d7109/L (NR 3.3-8.6\u00d7109/L) with 23.1% neutrophils; 69.7% lymphocytes; 6.1% monocytes; and no blasts; and a platelet count of 20.0\u00d7109/L (NR 158-348\u00d7109/L). The platelet count fell sharply over a six-month period, preceding decreases in the Hb value and neutrophil count. Flow cytometry detected paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clones among granulocytes (1.041%) and red blood cells (0.387%). A bone marrow examination revealed hypoplastic marrow with no signs of hematological malignancy, such as leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (Fig. 2). Both T1- and T2-weighted MRI of the spine showed mainly high signal intensity (SI) areas. These areas were depicted as low SI on short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging, suggesting that the bone marrow had been completely replaced by fat (Fig. 3). Taken together, these findings led to a diagnosis of moderate AA that does not require a blood transfusion at all. In addition, we identified haplotypes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) as DRB1*15:01 and DRB1*15:02, which are common in Japanese patients with AA (Table).\n\nFigure 2.

A lupus anticoagulant (LAC) panel yielded a positive result for dilute Russell's viper venom time but a negative result for the activated partial thromboplastin time. Other risk factors associated with thromboembolism, including protein C antigen, protein C activity, protein S activity, and serum anti-phospholipid antibodies, were within normal ranges.\n\nThe clinical course is shown in Fig. 4. Mesalazine (to treat CCS) was discontinued due to its potential risk of causing AA. The total administration period before discontinuation was 22 months. The patient subsequently received a standard dose of cyclosporine (CsA), with the trough concentration adjusted to achieve a target range of 150-250 ng/mL. Although the patient had briefly required platelet transfusion, the platelet counts gradually increased and were maintained at >10\u00d7109/L. At the same time, the WBC count increased gradually in the absence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).\n\nFigure 4. Clinical course. Due to the progressive thrombocytopenia and mild anemia, mesalazine was discontinued. Cyclosporine was initiated, and the platelets recovered with transient platelet transfusions. PSL: prednisolone, CsA: cyclosporine, PC: platelet concentrate, EPAG: eltrombopag, Neutro: neutrophils, Hb: hemoglobin, Reti: reticulocytes\n\nDespite these treatments, accompanying anemia slowly deteriorated. At 4 months after starting CsA, PSL was once again increased from 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day because of a flare of diarrhea. Reticulocytes subsequently increased. At five months after starting CsA, eltrombopag (EPAG) was commenced with the intention of ameliorating thrombocytopenia. At the time of writing, the patient remains free from blood transfusion on 3-drug combination therapy of PSL at 14 mg/day, CsA at 275 mg/day, and EPAG at 75 mg/day without recurrence of diarrhea or any other clinical symptoms of CCS.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe encountered a case of AA occurring in a patient with CCS treated using mesalazine. Symptoms were improved by immunosuppressive therapy using CsA. AA occurring after mesalazine administration for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been reported as drug-induced pancytopenia, known as \u201cmesalazine-induced AA.\u201d However, in such cases, PNH-type blood cells are often detected, as in our case, suggesting the involvement of immunological mechanisms.\n\nThe established treatment for CCS is immunosuppressive therapy (3,8,9). Corticosteroids and CsA are the drugs of choice, with or without mesalazine. Corticosteroids are critical for treating autoimmune disorders, but steroid-sparing strategies are often used to avoid the side effects (10). Mesalazine is widely used to treat IBDs, such as UC and Crohn's disease. The side effects of mesalazine include hematologic disorders such as agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, and AA. Late-onset AA is a rare but potentially fatal adverse effect (11-16). The onset of mesalazine-induced AA varies from months to years, but a one-year period is usually required to diagnose mesalazine-induced AA. The treatment for mesalazine-induced AA is, of course, drug discontinuation. However, bone marrow recovery is not a rapid process, and additional supportive treatment including G-CSF is sometimes needed (11,12). Four case reports have described utilizing antilymphocyte/antithymocyte globulin therapy (as a monotherapy or combination with CsA) (11,13,15), two of which were treated successfully (11,14). Previous case reports have suggested these treatment strategies, but unfortunately, patients frequently develop severe infections due to profound neutropenia, often leading to death (13,16).\n\nDrug-induced AA is a consequence of chemical and physical damage to bone marrow and is treated by supportive care, including blood transfusions and hematopoietic growth factors (17). In the present case, we started immunosuppressive therapy using CsA three days after the discontinuation of mesalazine, due to the severity of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Although insufficient time was available to observe bone marrow recovery with mesalazine discontinuation alone, hematological improvement was slow even after the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, a flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood from the present patient showed increased percentages of PNH-type cells (18,19), which are regarded as a marker for immune-mediated bone marrow failure. Studies of PNH-type cells from AA patients complicated by UC have shown a high prevalence of increased PNH-type cells, even among mesalazine-treated patients, suggesting that AA associated with UC has an immune-mediated mechanism, and mesalazine itself may have been unrelated to the development of AA (20,21).\n\nSpecific HLA profiles are linked to autoimmune disorders (22-24). HLA-DRB1*15:01 is more common in AA (25,26), and patients showing DRB1*15:01 are more likely to improve in response to CsA (27). In Japan, the frequency of HLA DRB1*15:01 and DRB1*15:02 is significantly higher in patients with AA than in healthy controls (28). Of interest, HLA-DRB1*15:02 has been reported to show a strong association with UC among Japanese patients (29). Nakagawa et al. investigated HLA profiles in 14 AA patients with UC, and six patients proved positive for DRB1*15:02. In addition, another major DR15 allele, DRB1*15:01, was confirmed in four patients. Two patients had both DRB1*15:01 and DRB1*15:02. These results suggest a common immune pathophysiology between AA and UC (20). Only one case report described HLA-A/B typing of a patient with CCS, but the HLA DR loci were not described (30). Interestingly, the present patient had both HLA DRB1*15:01 and DRB1*15:02. As CCS is considered an IBD-related disease, further investigation is warranted to elucidate the significance of HLA and its association with CCS.\n\nRepeated thromboembolism is another concern. Several case reports have described the cooccurrence of thrombotic event with CCS (31-33). Possible causes of thrombosis are concomitant malignancy (31,32) and sepsis (33), but these factors were not confirmed in our case. Corticosteroid, which is a key drug for the treatment of CCS, is a well-known predisposing factor for thromboembolism (34). Although corticosteroid might have induced cerebellar infarction in our case, regardless of anticoagulation with warfarin, his first thrombotic event occurred before the start of corticosteroid treatment for CCS. Corticosteroid was thus an unlikely cause of his first episode of thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis in the right lower leg and bilateral pulmonary emboli). Because a LAC panel yielded a positive result for dilute Russell's viper venom time, the coagulant disorder might be more closely related to autoimmune abnormalities than coexisting comorbidities and corticosteroid use.\n\nIn conclusion, autoimmune abnormalities suggested by the presence of antinuclear antibodies, positive immunostaining for IgG4, and concurrent AA in the present case were considered plausible etiological factors for CCS. The efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy also supports this concept. Why most patients with CCS are Japanese is unclear. Racial variations in HLA profiles and their associations with CCS are of interest. Although we were unable to clearly discriminate idiopathic from mesalazine-induced AA in this case, a common autoimmune abnormality might underlie both CCS and AA.\n\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).",

Full\u2010mouth disinfection, which terminates subgingival debridement within a short period, is applicable and effective in combination with antimicrobial agents in treating leukemic patients with severe periodontitis as an oral infection removal procedure prior to stem cell transplantation.\n\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a curative therapy for hematologic malignancies. Standard pretransplantation therapeutic approaches, including high\u2010dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and SCT, greatly improve the prognosis of leukemic patients. At multiple phases during SCT, patients are at risk of contracting infectious diseases due to profound and prolonged neutropenia.\n1\n The US National Cancer Institute indicated that odontogenic infection is a potential source of systemic infections that should be eliminated by dental treatment.\n2\n, \n3\n However, no definitive criteria for extraction or preservation of infected teeth that do not affect hematological treatment have been established for recipients with severe infections, including patients with hematological malignancies.\n\nHere, we present a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with severe periodontitis prior to SCT that was treated with a regimen involving full\u2010mouth disinfection (FMD).\n\n2 CASE REPORT\nA 38\u2010year\u2010old man diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and scheduled to undergo chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and SCT was referred to our department for odontogenic infection screening. After evaluation of his clinical oral condition, dental X\u2010ray photographs, and the presence of periodontitis\u2010related bacteria by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), a diagnosis of generalized severe periodontitis (generalized periodontitis stage IV, grade C) was made. The patient had already received intravenous antimicrobial infusion for febrile neutropenia (FN) on admission to the hospital; however, periodontitis\u2010related bacteria were detected (Table\u00a01). When the leukocyte count was low, we only followed the oral hygiene instructions. To remove dental plaque and supragingival calculus, scaling procedures on the gingival margin were performed at the time of recovery from FN after induction of chemotherapy. To prevent bacteremia and septicemia after SCT, FMD was considered to remove the infectious source via completion of scaling and root planing (SRP) within the limited dental treatment window of only 1\u00a0week, covering all periodontally infected teeth (Figure\u00a01). Before the initiation of chemotherapy, oral hygiene instructions were provided to the patient to avoid risk of infection from dental foci. In the neutropenic phase, during chemotherapy and immunosuppression, oral care was provided to reduce oral complications including oral mucositis and acute periodontitis. Since his first visit to our department, the patient was expected to develop chemotherapy\u2010induced FN and oral mucosal disorders. We thus provided the patient with thorough oral hygiene instructions aiming to quantitatively reduce the source of infection in the mouth. Specifically, the patient was instructed on the toothbrush Bass technique regarding the toothbrush and interdental brush cleaning methods. Oral assessments were performed based on an oral assessment guide,\n4\n and the information was shared with the physician and nurses. A nonirritating moisturizer was used for xerostomia.\n\nTABLE 1 Quantitative evaluation of periodontitis\u2010related bacteria in the deepest periodontal pocket of the patient\n\n\tBaseline (count)\tSeven months after FMD (count)\t\nTotal bacteria\t30\u00a0000\t<1000\t\n\nPorphyromonas gingivalis\n\t570\t<10\t\n\nTannerella forsythia\n\t1300\t<10\t\n\nTreponema denticola\n\t1100\t<10\t\n\nFusobacterium nucleatum\n\t2000\t<10\t\nJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdFIGURE 1 Treatment timeline. The patient was a 38\u2010year\u2010old male hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipient with generalized severe periodontitis\n\nThe patient achieved complete remission following induction of chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide vincristine, prednisolone, daunorubicin, and L\u2010asparaginase and consolidation chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone. The myelosuppression grades of these chemotherapies\u00a0were categorized as severe and moderate, respectively.\n5\n Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured when fever and febrile neutropenia (FN) were present. PCT was predominantly higher (7.4\u00a0ng/mL) in the presence of FN and septic shock during the first round of chemotherapy on day \u2212116. Otherwise, the PCT was not predominant during the pretransplant oral care and at 1\u00a0month after the transplant, which is the focus of this study (Figure\u00a01). Blood cultures were performed at the time of fever, and the only positive results between the time of admission and 1\u00a0month after transplantation were obtained from day \u2212116 to day \u2212111. At that time, FN and septic shock were both present, and the patient was positive for Corynebacterium striatum and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. No oral bacteria were found. Mechanical debridement for severe periodontal disease was then scheduled during the non\u2010neutropenic period after chemotherapy induction and consolidation. The day on which SCT was performed was designated day 0. To gain sufficient healing time of SRP for debridement of the periodontal deep pocket before SCT and to avoid reinfection from an untreated site to the treatment site in this case, we planned for FMD combined with systemic antimicrobial therapy, which could effectively be used to treat patients who had been diagnosed with generalized severe periodontitis in a short period of time.\n6\n After the first round of chemotherapy, we considered performing the procedure if the white blood cell count was normal. However, after consulting with the hematologist, we decided to schedule the consolidation chemotherapy; thus, the medical team considered the time when the consolidation chemotherapy was finished, the white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts had recovered, there was no febrile neutropenia, and there was enough time for the wound to heal after FMD. As a result of this discussion, we treated for severe periodontitis in a short period from day \u221230 to day \u221222. FMD was performed from days \u221230 to \u221222 for debridement of all periodontal pockets by SRP with Gracey curettes. We performed SRP for tooth numbers 36, 37, 38, 46, 47, and 48 on day \u221230 (Federation Dentaire Internationale System); tooth numbers 14\u201018 and 24\u201028 on day \u221227; tooth numbers 31, 32, 33, 35 and from 41\u201044 on day \u221224; and finally, tooth numbers 13, 21, 22, and 23, on day \u221222. During FMD, the patient was treated with sitafloxacin (100\u00a0mg/day for 14\u00a0days) to prevent bacteremia/septicemia, periodontopathic bacterial infection, and fever, which are possible adverse complications induced by FMD.\n7\n Both body temperature and C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) level were stable during FMD period, with a maximum body temperature of 37.0\u00b0C and maximum CRP concentration of 1.13\u00a0mg/dL (Figure\u00a01). Allogeneic peripheral blood SCT was performed with myeloablative conditioning on day 0. The graft contained CD34+ cells at 2.66\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/kg. Myeloablative conditioning was based on total body irradiation at 12\u00a0Gy in six fractions on day \u22128 to \u22126, administered in combination with cytarabine 2000\u00a0mg/m2/day on days \u22125 to \u22124 and cyclophosphamide 60\u00a0mg/kg/day on days \u22123 to \u22122. In the nadir phase, the physician and nurses checked the patient's condition including oral conditions daily using the oral assessment guide to score the patient's voice, swallowing, lips, tongue, saliva, mucous membranes, gums, teeth, and dentures.\n4\n The records confirmed that there was no odontogenic infection. From day\u00a0+\u00a06, we also performed the same assessment after SCT. No acute exacerbation of periodontitis was detected. Oral mucositis was present from days\u00a0+\u00a02 to\u00a0+\u00a010. The attended hematologists and nurses shared this patient's treatment plan, the patient's condition, and oral assessment through conferences and we discussed the treatment plan with them. Seven and 13\u00a0months after FMD (6 and 12\u00a0months after SCT), the microbiological and clinical parameters of periodontitis, as demonstrated by the O\u2019Leary plaque control record, decreased from 95% to 19%. Additionally, bleeding on probing (BOP), an indicator of periodontal inflammation (including gingivitis), decreased from 81.6% to 7.5% (Table\u00a02). Probing depth (PD), defined as the distance from the bottom of the periodontal pocket to the gingival cuff, also improved. Deeper periodontal pockets indicate greater alveolar bone resorption. PD \u22654\u00a0mm and PD \u22657\u00a0mm significantly reduced after FMD from 98.3% to 4.6% and from 31.6% to 0%, respectively; the mean PD reduced from 6.1 to 2.5\u00a0mm (Table\u00a02). At 13\u00a0months after FMD, gingival inflammation was effectively reduced (Figure\u00a02 A,B), the teeth affected by severe periodontitis were preserved, alveolar bone was regenerated (Figure\u00a02C,D), and functional occlusion was achieved without tooth extraction. Furthermore, qPCR data revealed no periodontitis\u2010related bacteria in the deepest periodontal pocket during the initial examination (Table\u00a01).\n\nTABLE 2 Clinical characteristics of the patient at baseline and 13\u00a0mo after FMD\n\nCharacteristics\tBaseline\t13\u00a0mo after FMD\t\nPlaque control record (%)\t95\t19\t\nBOP (mean %)\t81.6\t7.5\t\nPD \u22654\u00a0mm (mean %)\t98.3\t4.6\t\nPD \u22657\u00a0mm (mean %)\t31.6\t0\t\nPD (mm; mean)\t6.1\t2.5\t\nAbbreviations: BOP, bleeding on probing; FMD, full\u2010mouth disinfection; PD, probing depth.\n\nJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdFIGURE 2 Oral evaluation and dental radiographic images.

B, Intraoral image after SCT and full\u2010mouth disinfection (FMD). C, Radiographic images at the initial visit. D, Radiographic images after SCT and FMD\n\n3 DISCUSSION\nWe have demonstrated a case in which FMD was effective in treating generalized severe periodontitis without interfering with chemotherapy or SCT. Moreover, FMD effectively removed infectious sources and SRP was completed within only a few days throughout the entire jaw using antimicrobial agents. Upon re\u2010evaluation after SCT, we confirmed improvement of the periodontal status, bone regeneration at the resorption site, and observed no odontogenic infectious complications.\n\nFull\u2010mouth disinfection with systemic antimicrobial therapy was conducted on this patient for three reasons: (a) The patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, indicating immunodeficiency; (b) intensive chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and SCT were scheduled at the first visit; and (c) intensive periodontal treatment reportedly reduces the occurrence of febrile neutropenia, significantly reducing CRP levels.\n8\n Before administering the conditioning regimen preceding hematopoietic SCT, the period available for dental treatment, including tooth extraction and periodontal basic therapy, is limited due to the development of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Moreover, the conventional method of nonsurgical periodontal therapy consists of SRP, which involves the debridement of periodontal pockets in the jaw quadrants (Q\u2010SRP).\n9\n, \n10\n However, as most periodontopathic bacteria exist in periodontal pockets as well as in several other oral mucosal sites, including the saliva,\n11\n the treated periodontal pockets could be reinfected from the untreated regions\n12\n during Q\u2010SRP. Quirynen et al\n7\n, \n13\n suggested a one\u2010stage FMD protocol instead of the conventional strategy with consecutive debridement per quadrant over a 1\u20102\u2010week interval. On the contrary, Herrera and colleagues have suggested that antimicrobials should be administered immediately after the end of debridement and that debridement should be terminated in as short a time as possible, that is, within 1\u00a0week.\n14\n Yashima et al\n15\n found that if the SRP was completed within 1\u00a0week of maintaining the effective concentration of the antimicrobial agent (azithromycin), the clinical fungicidal efficacy of SRP was comparable to that of one\u2010stage full\u2010mouth SRP. Thus, termination of SRP within 1\u00a0week under antimicrobial administration would be equivalent in clinical efficacy to SRP within 24\u00a0hours. Furthermore, in practice, SRP below the gingival margin of the entire jaw in 1\u00a0day is known to be burdensome for patients and to cause a high frequency of fever.\n7\n Therefore, we planned to complete the SRP within approximately 1\u00a0week in this case while monitoring the patient's physical condition and response on the dental chair. Systematic review and meta\u2010analysis\n16\n have revealed that FMD combined with systemic administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole improved the clinical and microbiological outcomes significantly and effectively. These combined periodontitis treatments have not been approved in Japan. However, in our study, we systemically administrated sitafloxacin, which has been reported as significantly effective against periodontopathic bacteria.\n17\n, \n18\n Leukemic patients with pancytopenia and hematopoietic dysfunction are often immunodeficient, with difficulty in maintaining hemostasis, which increases the risks of postoperative infection and hemorrhage. Hence, it is preferable to conduct these treatments when patients attain normal hematopoiesis after the nadir phase, in which remission induction and consolidation chemotherapy suppress tumor cells. Thus, a desirable disinfection protocol includes (a) postinduction and consolidation chemotherapy; (b) following exit from the nadir phase, administration of antibiotics in combination with oral care; and (c) completion (with epithelialization) of the indicated dental surgical treatments before pretreatment (chemotherapy and total body irradiation) for SCT. Another study showed that reduced frequency of FN coincided with periodontal treatment.\n19\n These studies clearly demonstrate the importance of periodontal management in patients with leukemia and periodontal disease.\n\nIn our case, adverse events induced by dental treatment did not occur before or after SCT. Leukemic patients with severe odontogenic infection can experience infections within the periodontal deep pockets. For instance, a prospective observational study indicated that patients with periodontal inflammation had bacteremia more often than those with healthy periodontal tissue and that bleeding on probing was related to bacteremia.\n20\n These conditions may lead to bacteremia and septicemia before and after the SCT immunodeficient phase. Moreover, previous studies have shown that periodontal disease is associated with markedly elevated hospital charges, longer hospital stays, and higher rates of infectious complications in SCT recipients.\n21\n Furthermore, significantly lower frequencies of both oral and systemic infections were observed in patients undergoing chemotherapy that completed all dental treatments compared with those who did not. However, this difference was dependent on the chemotherapy grade.\n5\n, \n22\n\n\n\nHence, dental treatment should be implemented prior to, during, and following SCT and chemotherapy. To this end, FMD can be integrated into existing protocols and regimens for hematology treatment without interfering with SCT. Furthermore, the lack of periodontitis\u2010related bacteria as detected by qPCR after FMD combined with systemic antimicrobial therapy suggests that FMD with systemic antimicrobial therapy may alter the oral microbiome of patients with severe periodontitis to a more desirable state.\n6\n, \n16\n However, the establishment of pre\u2010 and post\u2010SCT protocols based on individual patients\u2019 oral condition is required to prevent oral adverse events. Overall, FMD can be performed rapidly and before SCT, providing effective oral care and improving the condition of leukemic patients with severe periodontitis.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nSM: provided clinical oral care, conducted full\u2010mouth disinfection, collected and analyzed the data, and primarily wrote the manuscript.

A standard of care for IC/BPS has not been established, and most patients must undergo a series of different treatment options, with potential for severe adverse events. Here, we report a patient with a 26-year history of IC/BPS following treatment with multiple therapies, including low doses of etodolac, amitriptyline and gabapentin, which she was unable to tolerate because of adverse effects, including headaches, blurred vision and cognitive impairment. The patient achieved a complete clinical remission with minimal adverse events after 16 cycles of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) intravenous (IV) infusions over a period of 5 months, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced when compared to measurements taken at presentation. Personalized low dose NAC IV infusion therapy represents an effective, safe, anti-inflammatory therapy administered in the outpatient setting for IC/BPS, and warrants further investigation.\n\nTEXT:\n1. Introduction\n\nInterstitial Cystitis (IC), or Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS), is a heterogeneous condition involving inflammation of the urinary bladder wall that produces debilitating symptoms of pelvic pain and frequent urination in affected patients. Since the etiology of IC/BPS is yet unknown, it is clinically diagnosed by exclusion in patients exhibiting bladder or pelvic pain, urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia [1,2,3,4]. Another consequence of the imprecise diagnostic criteria is a lack of certainty in IC/BPS occurrence. It has been established that the condition is disproportionately seen among women [5,6], comprising up to 90% of cases in the United States [6]. A 2016 report estimated that between 2.7% and 6.5% of American women experience IC/BPS symptoms, but prevalence in both men and women is likely underreported [6]. The heterogeneous nature of symptoms may be explained by the increasingly widespread theory that IC/BPS is likely caused by multiple diseases which produce chronic inflammation, manifesting as various lower urinary tract symptoms [1].\n\nA standard of care for interstitial cystitis has not yet been established and, as a consequence, most patients must undergo a series of different treatment options to elucidate what is effective for their individual situation. Current treatments for IC/BPS include drug therapy such as dimethyl sulfoxide, amitriptyline, pentosane polysulfate, cyclosporine A, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds, as well as alternative medicine treatments involving the modification of lifestyle factors [2,7,8]. Although pharmacological therapies have shown some benefit in control of IC/BPS symptoms, they may have a negative impact on the patient due to the inherent potential of adverse events [9]. In vivo studies using mouse models have shown that pentosan polysulfate may cause uncontrolled activation of immune function, which may lead to chronic inflammation, hypersensitivity, or autoimmunity [10]. As IC/BPS therapies continue to evolve, triple-targeted therapy using gabapentin, amitriptyline, and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes [11,12]. Gabapentin is an effective anticonvulsant which addresses the chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, associated with IC/BPS [12]. Serving as an extension of pain management, amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, has been found to act as an effective analgesic in many patients [12,13]. Using these two drugs in combination with NSAIDs is a strategy for treatment of IC/BPS that attempts to target pain and overactive bladder symptoms, including voiding frequency and urgency [11], in a more effective way than using one medication alone.\n\nDespite promising results, triple-targeted therapies are not without potential for severe adverse events. Gabapentin carries the risks of psychedelic properties, dizziness, and respiratory failure [14], while amitriptyline can cause serious side effects such as blurred vision, tachycardia, and hypotension [15]. In combination, studies show that these drugs may cause side effects such as dizziness and sedation in up to half of participants [16]. Very few studies have examined the effects of this triple-therapy for IC/BPS treatment, and those that have been conducted focused on small cohorts with limited follow-up periods [11,12]. Additionally, these studies show that, although alleviation of symptoms was reported early in treatment with triple-therapy, the initial decrease in symptoms levels off after weeks or months of treatment [11,12].\n\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a potential alternative novel therapy to reduce the inflammation associated with IC/BPS. NAC works directly by scavenging free radicals, and indirectly by increasing intracellular levels of glutathione, the most prevalent cellular antioxidant [17]. NAC has been shown to reduce oxidative stress in cells [18], as well as exert systemic anti-inflammatory effects in the body, with little to no harmful effects reported [17]. Clinically, NAC is used to treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including several inflammation-related diseases such as asthma, ulcerative colitis, and chronic bronchitis [17]. Taken together, the dualistic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions of NAC can be utilized to treat patients with IC/BPS by modifying the immune microenvironment to augment anti-inflammatory responses.\n\nAlthough outcome measurements of IC/BPS treatments are largely symptom-based, multiple studies have reported the value of tracking cytokines in monitoring the disease course [19,20]. Expressions of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 are all significantly elevated in animals [21], as well as human patients with IC/BPS, in comparison to individuals without the disease [19,20]. These persistently increased pro-inflammatory cytokines indicate a chronic inflammatory immune response, which is a likely contributor to IC/BPS pathology and symptoms [19,20,21].\n\nWe use a novel personalized treatment approach of NAC intravenous (IV) infusion dosing and frequency based upon serial plasma cytokine measurements to monitor the efficacy of treatment by reduction of symptoms and cytokine levels, while minimizing adverse events. In this case report, we describe a female patient presenting with IC/BPS for over 26 years following multiple therapies, including low-dose triple therapy of amitriptyline, gabapentin, and NSAID, which were terminated due to adverse events. At our clinic, the patient achieved a complete clinical remission with minimal adverse events after 16 cycles of NAC IV infusions over a period of 5 months, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced when compared to measurements taken at presentation.\n\n2. Results\n\nCase Report\n\nA 70-year-old woman with a history of IC/BPS first attended our clinic in September 2019 (timeline of the key information is summarized in Figure 1). In 1961, the patient had frequent urination with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). In 1968, the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident and she had fractures of L3-L5 and injury to her bladder. She subsequently developed chronic bladder and pelvic pain, urinary frequency, urgency and nocturia, and she was diagnosed with IC/BPS in 1994. The patient opted not to take prescribed medications and she adopted a holistic lifestyle consisting of a vegan diet, acupuncture, and massage therapy. In 2012 the patient was enrolled in an IC/BPS medical trial which included low doses of etodolac, amitriptyline and gabapentin for 3 months. After experiencing adverse effects including headaches, blurred vision and cognitive impairment, the patient ended her participation in the clinical trial and she resumed her holistic program.\n\nIn September 2019, the patient attended our clinic for evaluation of her disease and immune status. The patient reported mild urinary incontinence, difficulty starting and frequent, painful urination. A Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency (PUF) questionnaire was administered to rule out other probable causes of painful urination such as endometriosis, or UTI. The PUF questionnaire was chosen over other IC/BPS questionnaires due to its comprehensive nature and its demonstrated ability to distinguish IC/BPS more efficiently [22,23]. The PUF scale showed a score of 28. Scores greater than 10 are associated with 90% sensitivity for IC/BPS [24]. Plasma cytokines showed levels of IL-1\u03b2 at 19.49 pg/mL (elevated at 50th\u201375th percentile), TNF-\u03b1 at 10.54 pg/mL (elevated at 75th\u201390th percentile), IL-10 at 7.72 (elevated at 50th\u201375th percentile), IL-8 at 2.24 pg/mL (at 25th\u201350th percentile), and IL-6 at 3.02 pg/mL (elevated at 50th\u201375th percentile) (Figure 2). Reference ranges by percentile were determined by calculating the mean and standard deviation from a cohort of healthy men and women. Treatment options discussed included responses and side effects of pentosane polysulfate, amitriptyline, cimetidine, cyclosporin A, hydroxyzine, self-care practices and behavior modification techniques, or no therapy. The patient refused treatments with potentially severe side effects and continued her holistic program.\n\nIn February 2020, the patient reported persistent urinary incontinence and worsening frequent/painful urination. The patient gave informed consent for treatment using personalized low dose N-acetylcysteine (NAC) IV infusions, including publication of results. The objective was to treat the chronic inflammation associated with IC/BPS using weekly low dose NAC IV infusions. Variation of the duration, dosing and frequency of administration of NAC was based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and plasma cytokine levels.\n\nOn 5 May 2020, the patient started her weekly NAC IV infusions at a low dose of 6000 mg per IV infusion cycle. Plasma cytokines levels were elevated, with IL-1\u03b2 at 18.27 pg/mL (elevated at 50th\u201375th percentile), TNF-\u03b1 at 6.22 pg/mL (elevated at 50th\u201375th percentile), IL-10 24.72 pg/mL (elevated above 90th percentile), IL-8 at 1.79 pg/mL (at 25th\u201350th percentile), and IL-6 at 3.37 pg/mL (elevated at 50th\u201375th percentile) (Figure 2). On 26 May 2020, the patient complained of bladder discomfort and urinary frequency, and urinalysis confirmed an Escherichia coli infection for which the patient was treated with 500 mg of levofloxacin once a day for three days, along with her weekly NAC IV infusions. By 1 June 2020, the patient denied any urinary frequency, urgency, or bladder discomfort.\n\nOn 10 June 2020, the patient had successfully completed 5 NAC IV infusions with no complications. The patient was asymptomatic of all pain and urinary symptoms, and she chose to suspend NAC treatment. On 17 July 2020, the patient reported urinary urgency and she resumed weekly NAC IV infusions. After three more IV infusions the patient reported that her urinary urgency, incontinence, pains and spasms had completely resolved, and the patient remarked that this was the first time that she was completely pain free.\n\nThe patient experienced no associated side effects of the treatment. Plasma cytokine evaluation showed reductions in IL1-\u03b2 at 10.75 pg/mL (at 25th\u201350th percentile), TNF-\u03b1 at 3.56 pg/mL (at 25th\u201350th percentile), IL-10 8.00 pg/mL (elevated at 50th\u201375th percentile), IL-8 at 1.02 pg/mL (below 10th percentile), and IL-6 at 2.58 pg/mL (at 25th\u201350th percentile) (Figure 2). The patient was recommended to continue weekly NAC IV infusions to further reduce chronic inflammation.\n\nIn October 2020, the patient completed her 16th and final NAC IV infusion cycle, with no associated side effects. The patient continued to report no recurrence of urinary pains, spasms, urgency, or incontinence. Plasma cytokines showed continued improvements, with IL1-\u03b2 at 7.88 pg/mL (at 25th\u201350th percentile), TNF-\u03b1 at 1.45 pg/mL (below 10th percentile), IL-10 at 3.25 pg/mL (at 10th\u201325th percentile), IL-8 at 1.09 pg/mL (below 10th percentile), and IL-6 at 4.22 pg/mL (elevated at 50th\u201375th percentile) (Figure 2). The PUF questionnaire given at this time yielded a score of 11, which was an improvement from the baseline of 28. Five months following completion of the NAC IV infusion cycles, the patient remains in complete clinical remission. This is the longest duration of time that the patient has remained completely symptom-free.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nWe report a case of complete clinical remission of IC/BPS with personalized NAC IV infusions in a patient who had suffered for at least 26 years with debilitating symptoms, despite undergoing a series of commonly used treatments. The patient did not experience any therapy-related adverse events throughout the course of personalized NAC treatment. Symptom relief occurred after 4 NAC IV infusions, and the patient achieved complete clinical remission after completing 16 NAC IV infusions, with marked improvements in levels of plasma cytokines.\n\nNAC as a treatment for interstitial cystitis is a novel approach. Based on experimental data and successful treatment of several chronic inflammation-related diseases [17], we personalized the dose and schedule of low-dose NAC by monitoring symptoms and plasma cytokines before and after infusions. Recent studies using NAC to treat liposaccharide-induced interstitial cystitis in rats demonstrated positive results [25,26]. Intraperitoneal NAC injections in rat subjects reduced inflammation, reversed the progression of fibrosis, and restored the integrity of the urothelium, resulting in improvement of abnormal voiding symptoms [25]. Although it is generally well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects [18], NAC may act like a pro-oxidant at high doses, increasing oxidative stress and stimulating inflammation and abnormal cell proliferation [25,27,28]. Because of this potential risk, appropriate dosing is crucial in clinical application of NAC. In our treatment plan, variation of duration, dosage, and frequency of administration of NAC was based on plasma cytokine levels, and the patient was monitored frequently, with symptom tracking using the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency (PUF) questionnaire. The patient received low doses of 6000 mg per IV infusion cycle and showed no adverse reactions to the treatment. Although there is not a universal standard for NAC dosage, one meta-analysis showed ranges from 500\u20131200 mg once or twice per day, to 14,000 mg in multiple IV infusions over the course of a day [29]. A recent study using NAC to treat the cytokine storm of COVID-19 used a dosing regimen of 30,000 mg in three separate doses over 24 h, with favorable results [30].\n\nChronic inflammation manifesting as various lower urinary tract symptoms is characteristic of IC [1,3,4]. Elevated levels of cytokines such as IL1-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and IL-6 in patients with IC/BPS can serve as a guide for the dosing of NAC. IL-1\u03b2 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is primarily increased in patients with IC/BPS, and animal model studies have shown that NAC inhibits the pro-inflammatory expression of IL-1\u03b2 [19,20,21]. Immediately prior to beginning treatment in May 2020, the patient exhibited elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 at 18.27 pg/mL (Figure 2a), when the patient\u2019s symptoms of urinary pain, incontinence and urgency were severe, and accompanied by a high PUF score of 28. With continuous treatments of NAC, IL-1\u03b2 was reduced to 7.88 pg/mL, which was consistent with the resolution of symptoms and a decrease of the PUF score to 10.\n\nTNF-\u03b1 is a pleiotropic, pro-inflammatory cytokine released by mast cells in the bladder urothelium of patients with IC, and this overexpression has been shown to participate in IC/BPS pathology [31]. In a study using transgenic mice, TNF-\u03b1 was shown to promote urothelial apoptosis and cause the characteristic symptoms of pelvic pain, voiding abnormalities and urothelial lesions [31]. Our patient showed elevated TNF-\u03b1 levels prior to treatment, at 6.22 pg/mL (Figure 2b), higher than the average value reported in IC/BPS patients of 2.63 pg/mL [19,20]. After completing the full 16 cycles of NAC IV infusions, the patient\u2019s levels decreased to 1.45 pg/mL and correlated with symptom resolution. This value is much closer to the average TNF-\u03b1 expression observed in control patients of 0.91 pg/mL [19,20].\n\nFollowing completion of the 16 IV infusions of NAC in November, 2020, the patient\u2019s IL-8 levels decreased, indicating improvement (1.09 pg/mL vs. 1.79 pg/mL) (Figure 2d), and IL-10 levels also decreased (3.25 pg/mL vs. 24.72 pg/mL) (Figure 2c). While IL-10\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties are well documented, studies from recent years have shown its potential pro-inflammatory characteristics [32]. Patients treated with IL-10 displayed increased levels of inflammatory markers CRP, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) [33]. Other studies showed that IL-10 administration was associated with increases in levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1, although these did not show statistical significance [34]. This is consistent with the findings in our patient who demonstrated increased levels of IL-10, which correlated with increased levels of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1; these levels decreased when IL-10 expression decreased. Additional studies have revealed that IL-10 is significantly elevated in patients with UTIs [35,36]. Our findings are consistent, since, at the time of our patient\u2019s UTI at the beginning of treatment (Figure 1), she had the highest levels of IL-10 (Figure 2c). Once her UTI symptoms were resolved, IL-10 expression showed a dramatic decrease (Figure 2c). Collectively, these studies and our findings support the pro-inflammatory characteristics and increased expression of IL-10 in inflammatory environments [32,33,34,35,36].\n\nInterestingly, IL-6 levels initially decreased, from 3.37 pg/mL to lowest levels of 2.58 pg/mL in July after 5 NAC IV infusions, but then increased to 4.22 pg/mL in October 2020. The reason for the subsequent increase in IL-6 levels while on NAC is unclear, since all other pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced and she displayed no symptoms. Our patient\u2019s older age may be a factor, since younger patients with IC/BPS treated with cyclosporin A or pentosane polysulfate sodium did not exhibit significant changes to IL-6 levels; however, in older patients (patients older than 53 years), IL-6 levels were reduced after cyclosporin A treatment [37]. Further serum immune testing performed to monitor IL-6 in December 2020 showed a decreased level of 2.90 pg/mL, which was consistent with the decreases seen in her other pro-inflammatory cytokines. We are continuing to monitor our patient\u2019s IL-6 levels after completion of treatment. Overall, our patient\u2019s course of symptom relief correlated with an improvement of plasma cytokines levels. In July 2020, the patient reported a complete absence of urinary pains and spasms, as well as urinary urgency and incontinence. The patient has remained in clinical remission for five months following the completion of the IV infusion cycles in October 2020, and she has remained off all treatment.\n\nThis report describes a previously unreported approach for treating IC/BPS by measuring inflammatory biomarkers IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-6, and tailoring the dose and frequency of NAC IV infusions in response to the reduced expression of these biomarkers, combined with symptom monitoring using the PUF score. Our report serves as a basis for a precise and personalized low toxicity anti-inflammatory therapeutic option in patients with debilitating IC/BPS symptoms who have been unresponsive to commonly used treatments.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nIC/BPS is associated with debilitating symptoms which often show short-lived responses or lack of response to commonly used treatments. Our data showed that personalized treatment with low-dose IV infusions of NAC was associated with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines of IC/BPS, and resulted in the desired outcome of complete remission with no adverse events.\n\n5. Future Perspective\n\nThis case report shows that personalized anti-inflammatory treatment with NAC IV infusions resulted in complete clinical remission, with no adverse events, in a patient with IC/BPS who had suffered with chronic debilitating symptoms for over 26 years and who had a poor response and adverse events to commonly used treatments. This unique approach is an important contribution and it supports the need for future research concerning this therapeutic option to improve outcomes and minimize side effects in patients with IC/BPS.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank the patient for giving consent to publish our findings.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConcept and design, D.M.; data collection, analysis, and interpretation, D.M., G.S. and S.M.; drafting the manuscript for important intellectual content, D.M., G.S., S.M., C.J.H., and J.G.

Conservative treatment of FSGS is the main acceptable method due to the lack of randomized clinical trials. A few strategies are known to treat FSGS recurrence, such as plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), but failure to achieve remission may occur. In addition, some of these treatment strategies are more established in pediatric patients and lack evidence in adult patients. CASE REPORT We describe the case of a 24-year-old woman who had a kidney transplant due to FSGS and was admitted to the hospital for an evaluation of lower-limb and facial swelling. Her kidney biopsy showed segmental glomerulosclerosis compatible with recurrence of FSGS. Her FSGS relapses were further confirmed by increase in serum creatinine and proteinuria. The patient had several FSGS relapses that were treated by different combinations of plasmapheresis, pulse steroid, mycophenolic acid, tacrolimus, prednisolone, IVIG, and IV rituximab. She did not respond to conventional therapy and was eventually treated successfully using cyclophosphamide and remained in remission afterward. CONCLUSIONS FSGS has a high recurrence rate after kidney transplantation. A few options to achieve remission have been investigated. In this report, we present the case of a young woman with FSGS recurrence after a kidney transplant, achieving remission successfully with cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide can be used a treatment of FSGS recurrence in a transplanted kidney when all other options have been exhausted. Additional research is needed to assess the efficacy and safety profile of cyclophosphamide in such cases.\n\nTEXT:\nBackground\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is defined as segmental obliteration of the capillary lumina by the hyaline matrix component involving some of the nephrons [1]. It is considered the most frequent pathological lesions in adults with nephrotic syndrome [2]. FSGS is divided into 2 types based on the etiology of the disease. An idiopathic origin is regarded as primary FSGS. Causes of secondary FSGS include adaptive response of glomerular hypertension resulting from glomerulonephritis and diabetes mellitus, as well as hereditary/genetic glomeropathies (viral or drug-induced) and adaptive responses [3]. Moreover, primary FSGS is the only type related to recurrence in a transplanted kidney.\n\nTreating FSGS conservatively is generally the main acceptable method due to the dearth of randomized clinical trials; however, kidney survival in non-nephrotic patients is significantly better than in nephrotic patients [4]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are beneficial in reducing proteinuria and improving long-term kidney function by controlling blood pressure [5]. Nonetheless, possible adverse effects such as hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury must be monitored. In addition to rennin-angiotensin system inhibition, lifestyle modifications are essential to achieve a goal of blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg [5].\n\nAbout 40\u201370% of patients with FSGS need dialysis within 10\u201320 years after diagnosis [3,6,7]. For patients reaching end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation is the most suitable treatment option. However, primary FSGS has a recurrence rate of up to 30% [9]. Treatment of FSGS recurrence is challenging because of the limited treatment options. Plasmapheresis is the most common treatment and is reported to achieve remission in up to 63% of adults with recurrent FSGS following kidney transplantation [10]. Other medical treatment options include drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide [1]. However, some of these options lack evidence in adult patients.\n\nHerein, we present a case of an adult patient with FSGS treated by renal transplant who then developed a recurrence and was subsequently managed successfully with cyclophosphamide.\n\nCase Report\nA 24-year-old woman had been diagnosed with primary FSGS at age 10 years; nephrotic syndrome was noted on biopsy as primary FSGS. The patient was found to have primary steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and was started on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Three years later, she received a single-kidney transplant from a living non-related donor; her post-transplant kidney function was normal. She was started on mycophenolic acid (MMF), tacrolimus, and prednisolone after the transplant. The patient was compliant with her medications, but 2 years later she presented with bilateral lower-limb edema and facial puffiness. Her serum creatinine (SCr) had an almost 3-fold increase from her baseline of 60\u201370 umol/L. The initial kidney ultrasound (US) revealed mild increased size and echogenicity of the transplanted kidney (Figure 1A), as well as an increase in resistive index of the main renal artery (Figure 1B). A biopsy showed borderline changes for acute T cell-mediated rejection and features consistent with recurrent/de novo FSGS (Figure 2A). The pathological features included only 1 out 5 glomeruli with global glomerulosclerosis, 6 glomeruli with segmental sclerosis, mild interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. After excluding secondary causes of FSGS, the patient was treated by plasmapheresis in addition to pulse steroid and responded well, with SCr level returning to baseline. Three years later, she presented with symptoms similar to the first episode of recurrence. Her SCr was within her normal baseline, but urine analysis was positive for proteinuria. On admission, laboratory findings included decreased albumin (21 g/L) and 24-h urine collection with a protein level of 5.2 g/day. Renal US images revealed a mild degree of hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney, without stones, focal masses, or perinephric collection.\n\nThe kidney size was estimated to be 12\u00d75.1 cm with cortical thickness of 1.3 cm (Figure 3). A biopsy was planned immediately, which revealed segmental glomerulosclerosis in 4 out of 8 glomeruli, mild arteriolar hyalinosis, minimal interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy, showing a recurrence of FSGS without evidence of acute active cellular rejection (Figure 2B\u20132D). She was treated initially with 9 sessions of plasmapheresis in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and pulse steroid. The patient did not respond, and proteinuria persisted, exceeding 5 g/day; therefore, she was started on IV rituximab 375 mg. After the first dose, the patient responded well, with complete remission of FSGS noted by absence of proteinuria, improvement of albumin level (46 g/L), and reduction of 24-h urine protein to 145 mg/day. The patient was discharged on tacrolimus, and another dose of IV rituximab 375 mg was administered 1 week later. One month later, she experienced bilateral optic atrophy as an adverse effect of tacrolimus; thus, she was switched to cyclosporine. Two months after the second recurrence, repeated 24-h urine protein was 12.8 g/day, but the renal profile was normal. The patient was admitted as a case of FSGS recurrence and started on plasmapheresis and received 5 consecutive sessions, which reduced proteinuria to 6.2 g/day. She was discharged to continue 2 session per week of plasmapheresis for 3 months. During the second month of the planned plasmapheresis, the patient developed anasarca, and repeated 24-h urine protein was more than 20 g/day. Since her condition did not improve after plasmapheresis and administration of rituximab, cyclophosphamide was added to the plasmapheresis that she already was receiving, after discussion and informed consent. She was started on daily oral cyclophosphamide 100 mg, in addition to discontinuation of MMF. At 17 days after starting cyclophosphamide, her symptoms improved, and proteinuria fell to 0.7 g/day (Figure 4 demonstrates the timeline of FSGS disease, relapses, and medication regimen). She was discharged on the same dose of cyclophosphamide, prednisolone 10 mg, and cyclosporine 75 mg. Three months later, she had completed a 3-month course of cyclophosphamide, and MMF was resumed. Subsequently, on regular follow-up, she remained in partial remission, with proteinuria ranging from 0.5 g/day to 0.8 g/day.\n\nDiscussion\nThere are few options to treat FSGS recurrence after kidney transplantation. Many studies have noted evidence to support plasma exchange in treating primary recurrent FSGS. Plasma exchange has been shown to ameliorate proteinuria, improve kidney function, and prevent allograft loss [11]. Rituximab\u2019s role in preventing and treating the recurrence of FSGS was not fully established; however, rituximab achieved a significant decrease in proteinuria and recurrence rate as prophylactic therapy in high-risk patients [12].\n\nOur patient received multiple sessions of plasmapheresis, 2 doses of rituximab, and steroids, but she had another FSGS recurrence within 3 months. Moreover, a meta-analysis demonstrated that FSGS recurrence after kidney transplant can be treated with the combination of rituximab and plasmapheresis, which helped achieve remission in 72.7% of the cases [13]. Nonetheless, rituximab has shown beneficial outcomes in adults with FSGS recurrence after transplant, but there is no consensus on the exact dose or duration. Some patients have been reported to achieve complete remission after 2 doses [14], but others may require 3 or 4 doses [15]. Due to a lack of substantial evidence of the efficacy and safety of repetitive rituximab use, a trial of cyclophosphamide to save the graft improved our patient\u2019s symptoms and resolved her proteinuria.\n\nCyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard drug; its main effect is DNA alkylation [16]. The drug affects Th2 cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 by increasing the secretion in the blood and decreases interferon-gamma secretion [17]. However, the exact mechanism by which cyclophosphamide achieves its immunomodulatory effects is unclear. Theories include type I interferons induction, regulatory T cell elimination, and reducing rejection risk by decreasing the sensitivity of host cells to donor T cells [17].\n\nWhen used in patients with FSGS with native kidneys, cyclophosphamide has shown beneficial outcomes in achieving partial or complete remission [18]. Experts differ regarding use of cyclophosphamide in cases of FSGS recurrence after kidney. In the pediatric population, a case series of cyclophosphamide use in 11 children showed that 9 of them achieved remission, with 7 becoming free of disease [19]. Moreover, another case series on 6 children with recurrent FSGS treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange resulted in complete remission in 3 patients, while the rest had partial remission [20]. On the other hand, there is limited data in adult patients treated with cyclophosphamide for FSGS recurrence after kidney transplantation. A case report by Hristea et al describes a case similar to ours, in which the patient received plasmapheresis and rituximab, while cyclophosphamide was used to consolidate the outcomes rather than solely treating recurrence [21].\n\nOur patient received plasmapheresis, rituximab, and steroids, without significant remission. Cyclophosphamide was initiated, which resulted in partial remission. The effect of cyclophosphamide alone was not studied before; nonetheless, our patient received cyclophosphamide after exhausting the other options, but FSGS recurrence was eventually treated successfully.\n\nA limitation of this case report is that the patient\u2019s improvement started almost 4 months after starting rituximab, which may be the reason for achieving remission.\n\nConclusions\nFSGS has a high recurrence rate after kidney transplantation. A few options to gain remission are investigated. In this report, we present the case of a young woman with FSGS recurrence after kidney transplant, achieving remission successfully with cyclophosphamide. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this method.\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nNone.\n\nFigure 1.

The results identified the patient as a CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer (IM). Duloxetine-mediated competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 resulted in phenoconversion, whereby the patient's CYP2D6 phenotype was converted from IM to poor metabolizer for CYP2D6 co-medication. The medication risk score suggested a high risk of ADEs. Recommendations that accounted for PGx and drug-induced phenoconversion were accepted. After 1.5 months, therapy changes led to improved pain control, depression status, and quality of life, as well as increased heart rate, evidenced by patient-reported improved sleep patterns, movement, and cognition. This case highlights the pharmacist's role in using PGx testing and a CDSS to identify and mitigate medication-related problems to optimize medication regimen and medication safety.\n\nTEXT:\npmc\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEnvironmental, physiological, and psychological factors, as well as comorbidities and genetic variability, have been shown to affect interpatient variability in drug disposition and response [1]. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of human genome variants that impact drug response via variations in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters [2]. Therefore, PGx testing can support the identification of drug\u2013gene interactions (DGIs) and drug\u2013drug\u2013gene interactions (DDGIs). DGIs involve a drug and a variation in a gene that codes for a protein, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (e.g., citalopram and CYP2C19), a receptor (e.g., metoprolol and adrenoceptor beta 1 (ADRB1)) or a transporter (simvastatin and solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1, previously referred to OATP1B1)) [3]. The superimposition of a drug\u2013drug interaction (DDI) on a DGI can result in a DDGI, which frequently induces phenoconversion [3]. Phenoconversion is the ability of intrinsic (e.g., inflammation) [4,5] or extrinsic factors, such as drugs, to modify a genotype-predicted phenotypic expression [6]. For instance, a mismatch between the predicted phenotype from the determined CYP2C19 genotype and the observed CYP2C19 activity has been reported in patient with type 2 diabetes due to low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [7]. Similarly, a drug may induce CYP phenoconversion, and an individual identified as a CYP2D6 normal metabolizer (NM) with a *1|*1 genotype will be phenoconverted into a poor metabolizer (PM) while taking quinidine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor. Considering the two previously mentioned conditions, the metabolism of CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 substrates would be altered under such conditions, which may result in an increased risk of inappropriate response to substrates of these enzymes. To mitigate the effect of these DGIs and DDGIs, organizations such as the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) have developed guidance on drug and dose selection for certain drug\u2013gene pairs (e.g., duloxetine and CYP2D6, hydrocodone and CYP2D6, metoprolol and CYP2D6) based on current clinical evidence [8].\n\nLarge interindividual differences exist in response to analgesic therapy agents, such as prodrug opioids activated by CYP2D6 (e.g., codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone, oxycodone) [9]. The presence of variants in the CYP2D6 gene can contribute to variability in opioid response in terms of efficacy and/or risk of adverse drug events (ADEs). The opioid receptor \u00b51 (OPRM1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene variants have also been studied for their potential to affect opioid pharmacodynamic response [10]. While CPIC provides CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype-based recommendations for codeine, tramadol, and hydrocodone, no recommendations are currently available for dosing opioids based on either the OPRM1 or COMT genotype due to the lack of consistent evidence [11]. The prevalence of CYP450 DDIs among patients with chronic low back pain on long-term opioid therapy has been estimated to be 27%, which can further impact the response variability observed due to a higher risk of DDGIs [12]. The vast majority of the reported DDIs in an older adult population cohort were associated with medications known to inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme [12].\n\nIntegrating PGx into clinical practice could support antidepressant drug and dose selection. Currently, the antidepressant medication selection for each patient is dependent upon trial-and-error treatment strategies considering endophenotype, clinician preferences and clinical experience, and the patient\u2019s past medication history [13]. Implementation of a PGx decision support tool for antidepressant treatment may enhance the prediction of treatment response and the capability to foresee potential adverse side effects, minimizing prolonged suffered and adverse sequelae. PGx can support narrowing down the antidepressant drug and dose options, potentially leading to decreased risk of antidepressant-related toxicity and/or to achieve remission faster [14,15]. Variations in the CYP2C19 and/or CYP2D6 genes contributes to the variability observed in antidepressant response [16]. CPIC and DPWG provide genotype/phenotype-based recommendations for multiple selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants [17,18,19]. The glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 4 (GRIK4) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) gene variants have been studied for their potential to affect antidepressant pharmacodynamic response. However, no dosing recommendations are currently provided based on either genotype due to the dearth of consistent evidence [20].\n\nPolymorphisms in CYP2D6 are also associated with altered \u03b2-blocker metabolism [21]. CYP2D6 IMs and PMs typically experience greater reduction in heart rate, and some patients develop symptomatic bradycardia [22]. The ADRB1 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) gene variants have been studied for their potential to affect \u03b2-blockers\u2019 pharmacodynamic response. However, no dosing recommendations are currently provided based on either genotype due to the lack of consistent evidence [21].\n\nUnquestionably, applying PGx can be beneficial in certain cases. For example, studies of patients suffering from chronic pain and depression have revealed that pain- and depression-induced neuroplasticity changes and neurobiological mechanism changes can be closely interrelated [23]. Lack of control of these conditions can result in an enormous burden to the patient, caregivers, and healthcare system, resulting in increased costs [24,25]. Uncontrolled pain also reduces functional capacity and quality of life for patients, such as those living with obesity [26]. Patients diagnosed with chronic pain living with obesity are more likely to present with depressive symptoms than patients who are normal- or overweight [27]. It should be noted that depression in the older adult population has been associated with longer length of illness, more frequent major depressive disorder (MDD) recurrences, and a greater risk of comorbidities [28]. In this population, depression has been identified as one of the psychiatric illness most closely associated with suicide [29]. In 2012, a literature review reported that patients who have an inadequate response to their antidepressant regimen are expected to spend approximately USD 10,000 more annually on healthcare-related expenses than patients who have an adequate response [30]. Uncontrolled pain in the older adult population results in an annual cost of approximately USD 61.2 billion [31], while loss of productivity for patients and caregivers due to lack of pain control has been calculated to be USD 300 billion [32]. There is potential for cost savings in these populations.\n\nThe Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) receives capitated reimbursements on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid (a joint, federal and state program in the U.S.) for participants 55 years or older. PACE participants have a team of health care professionals collaborating to ensure that nursing home level coordinated care is provided in the home setting. The PACE model enables collaboration between pharmacists and other healthcare practitioners to identify and mitigate medication-related problems. PGx testing is one part of the initiatives implemented to further improve the care of PACE participants [33]. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are critical tools for the implementation of PGx into routine patient care and the adoption of PGx recommendations [34]. The proprietary CDSS, MedWise\u00ae, which has been described previously, incorporates PGx results in combination with the medication regimen to support clinicians with identifying clinically significant DDIs, DGIs, and DDGIs [35]. This CDSS generates a medication risk score (MRS) based on 5 factors, including CYP DDI risk. An increased MRS has been associated with a higher incidence of ADEs, healthcare-related expenditures, emergency department visits, hospitalizations and death [36]. Thus, the objective of this case report is to demonstrate the impact of a pharmacist-led medication evaluation, which incorporated PGx assisted by a CDSS, of a PACE participant with obesity and multiple comorbidities.\n\n2. Description of the Case Report\n\nA 66-year-old non-smoker female presented with a past medical history of obesity class III (body mass index = 64 kg/m2), uncontrolled chronic pain of multifactorial nature, uncontrolled MDD, hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, gout, hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, and candidiasis. Her medication regimen to treat her multiple comorbidities as prescribed by her primary care physician is described in Table 1. The CDSS generates a medication risk score (MRS) based on the current patient\u2019s drug regimen. The MRS is associated with healthcare outcomes and is the indicator used to measure the risk of adverse drug events associated with a given drug regimen. The MRS for this patient\u2019s drug regimen was 32 with a high-risk sub-score for CYP450 competitive drug interactions and very high-risk sub-score for sedative burden.\n\nThe patient\u2019s chief complaints when she enrolled in the PACE program in 2020 were inappropriate control of her depression and poor multifactorial pain control despite numerous trials of antidepressant and analgesic therapies (Table 2). Duloxetine was initially chosen to treat her depression status since it could also provide neuropathic pain relief. However, after being prescribed duloxetine for over 10 years, the patient experienced only minor improvement of MDD symptoms, and despite the use of a multimodal analgesic regimen, the patient continued experiencing uncontrolled pain. The addition of opioids (i.e., tramadol, hydrocodone) to her analgesic regimen was unsuccessful. Of note, while under treatment with metoprolol, the patient was borderline bradycardic per clinical assessment from her primary care physician. Upon review of the patient\u2019s drug regimen, utilizing the proprietary evidenced-based CDSS, the clinical pharmacist recommended conducting a PGx test to guide the optimization of her antidepressant and analgesic regimen. This recommendation was accepted by the primary care physician.\n\n3. Results\n\nA DNA sample was collected via buccal swab and analyzed by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory (OneOme, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The clinical pharmacist was consulted to interpret the PGx results and complete a multidrug interaction screening. Genotypic results identified the patient as a CYP2D6 IM, with a *1|*4 genotype (Table 3). PGx results were integrated into the CDSS [35]. The clinical pharmacist evaluated the PGx results, concomitant medications, the CDSS-generated MRS, and other patient-specific factors in order to formulate recommendations to the primary care physician for mitigating these medication-related problems to the primary care physician. Although the clinical pharmacist assessed the complete drug regimen, only recommendations relevant to pain, depression, and heart rate control management will be discussed in the context of this case report.\n\nConsidering the patient\u2019s CYP2D6 IM status, DGIs were identified affecting the metabolism of hydrocodone, duloxetine, and metoprolol. A CYP2D6 IM has reduced enzyme activity, which alters the clearance of duloxetine and metoprolol and can increase the risk of toxicity associated with these medications. CYP2D6-reduced enzyme activity also decreases the conversion of hydrocodone to hydromorphone and may increase the risk of pharmacotherapy failure and possibly ADEs. Therefore, the clinical pharmacist recommended changing duloxetine to desvenlafaxine, hydrocodone to morphine, and metoprolol to carvedilol. The three recommendations were accepted by the primary care physician.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe CDSS displays duloxetine, metoprolol, and hydrocodone (prodrug) as CYP2D6-substrates (Table 4). As a CYP2D6 IM, we would expect decreased activation of the prodrug, hydrocodone, and increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine and metoprolol due to decreased clearance of these metabolic pathways. When co-administered, duloxetine is expected to competitively inhibit the metabolism of hydrocodone and metoprolol, resulting in drug-induced phenoconversion to PM for these two drugs.\n\nThe presence of drug-induced phenoconversion was established based on the CDSS used in this study. This CDSS, supported by clinical and scientific literature, has embedded algorithms that consider several pharmacokinetic properties related to CYP450 metabolic pathways and their respective affinity (patent: WO 2019/089725). The phenotype based on the genotype (derived from PGx results) is combined with CYP450 drug-induced phenoconversion to estimate the patient phenotype for a given drug regimen. Considering that phenoconversion to a PM status was occurring at CYP2D6 for hydrocodone and metoprolol, the clinical pharmacist referred to CPIC guidance for dosing hydrocodone (Table S1) and DPWG guidelines (Table S2) recommendations for dosing metoprolol. The clinical pharmacist chose to recommend morphine, which is not dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism, avoiding DGI and DDGI on this isoenzyme. Additionally, morphine is a hydrophilic opioid; thus, the volume of distribution should not be significantly influenced by excess adipose tissue [39]. Metoprolol exhibits large inter-individual variability in pharmacodynamic response, likely due to its extensive dependence on CYP2D6 (\u224875%) for its clearance [40]. Greater area under the curve concentrations and decreased apparent oral clearance in CYP2D6 PMs and IMs translate into differences in heart rate [21]. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that highly lipophilic beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, have been associated with worsening depression symptoms [41]. Highly lipophilic drugs penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier more readily, which can result in more profound central nervous system effects [42]. This patient did not achieve heart rate control despite multiple attempts to adjust the metoprolol tartrate dose, and she had a diagnosis of heart failure. Therefore, bisoprolol and carvedilol, which are less lipophilic than metoprolol, were the two beta-blocker alternatives considered [43]. The metabolism of bisoprolol is not dependent on CYP2D6; however, it is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, and it is subject to competitive inhibition at this enzyme by stronger substrates, such as, amlodipine, dronedarone, and loperamide. This could potentially lead to an increased risk of ADEs. On the other hand, the clearance of carvedilol is significantly dependent on CYP2D6 [44]. Current evidence has shown that CYP2D6 PMs and IMs can have up to 2.5 times higher plasma carvedilol plasma concentrations, when comparing to NMs [45]. Despite increased concentrations of carvedilol, researchers have been unable to establish a relationship between the CYP2D6 phenotype and changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or rate of ADEs in patients with heart failure [46,47]. Thus, currently the 2018 update of the DPWG guidelines claim that the effect of the CYP2D6 DGI for carvedilol is likely clinically insignificant [48]. One plausible explanation for this is that, besides its beta-blocker effects, carvedilol also has alpha-blocking properties different from metoprolol [49]. Carvedilol is administered as a racemic mixture and both isomers have been shown to have equally potent alpha blocker properties; however, the S(-)-isomer is the major contributor to the beta-blocker effect [45]. Studies have shown that decreased CYP2D6 metabolism has a more significant impact on the clearance of the R(-)-isomer (alpha blockade) [45]. In this case, the primary care provider opted to prescribe a trial of carvedilol, though it was advised to start with a lower dose and titrate as tolerated.\n\nUpon medication review, it was noted that 10 years of treatment with the SNRI duloxetine did not produce satisfactory depression remission. Achieving depression remission among older adults is a common challenge, as more than 50% of these patients do not appropriately respond to first-line therapies of SSRIs or SNRIs [50]. For duloxetine, DPWG guidelines (Table S3) do not provide CYP2D6 phenotype-based recommendations, as antidepressant plasma concentrations seem to poorly correlate with antidepressant effectiveness. However, phenotype-based recommendations appear to provide more reliable information on the risk of ADEs [51]. Selecting an alternative antidepressant for an elderly patient is challenging due to the higher prevalence of polypharmacy, higher risk of DDIs, reduced medication adherence, and greater risk of ADEs in this population [52]. Because the patient was identified as a CYP2D6 IM, the clinical pharmacist recommended changing duloxetine to desvenlafaxine, which does not depend on CYP2D6 metabolism. As for duloxetine, desvenlafaxine can also contribute to neuropathic pain relief [53].\n\nA follow-up by the pharmacist occurred one and a half months post-implementation of the aforementioned recommendations to assess the analgesic, antidepressant, and heart rate control responses. Changes in therapy led to significantly improved pain, depression, and heart rate control, improving the quality of life of the patient as reported by the primary care physician. This was evidenced by patient reports of improved sleep patterns, movement, and cognition. As a first step in a more holistic medication action plan, the patient\u2019s MRS decreased from 32 to 29. Bankes et al. reported that each point increase in the MRS was associated with an 8.6% higher risk of having one or more ADEs per year, over USD 1000 in additional medical spending a year, 3.2 additional emergency department visits per 100 patients annually, and 2.1 more hospitalizations per 100 patients per year [36]. Ratigan et al. recently reported that although further evidence is needed to demonstrate that lowering the MRS results in a decrease in ADEs or death, interventions among patients on multiple medications that have higher MRS can enhance medication safety [54]. In this case, the decrease in the MRS was attributed to the fact that DDI-associated risk was diminished with the implementation of the clinical interventions.\n\nLimitations must be considered while integrating PGx into routine clinical practice [55]. A lack of universal training to support health care professionals with the interpretation of PGx results and issues related to their incorporation in the electronic health record exists. Other factors, such as ethnicity, sex, smoking status, and comorbidities, can contribute to interpatient variability in medication response in addition to genetic information. This is an iterative approach, and assessing PGx results is only one of the components to complete a comprehensive medication review, because not all medications have PGx recommendations or supporting evidence available. Furthermore, even when limited evidence exists on the impact of genetic variants for some drugs, this does not necessarily indicate that there is a lack of clinical impact for specific patients based on their comprehensive environment and condition. PGx is a relatively new science that is currently experiencing significant growth and has generated much interest among the research community.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThis patient might have achieved pain and depression remission sooner if a comprehensive preemptive PGx testing review and multidrug interaction screening had been performed. PGx testing can help predict tolerability and response [56], thus potentially enabling a more safe, effective, and cost-effective treatment [57]. This case highlights the value of PGx testing supported by CDSS, and the role of pharmacists in identifying medication-related problems and optimizing drug therapy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Pamela Dow and Dana Filippoli for their comprehensive review and comments pertaining to the contents of this manuscript.\n\nSupplementary Materials\n\nThe following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/medicina57090955/s1, Table S1: Adapted CPIC Recommendations to Guide Hydrocodone Therapy Considering CYP2D6 Phenotype, Table S2: Adapted DPWG Recommendations to Guide Metoprolol Therapy Considering CYP2D6 Phenotype, Table S3: Adapted DPWG Recommendations to Guide Duloxetine Therapy Considering CYP2D6 Phenotype.

In immunocompetent humans, acute infection is often asymptomatic, self\u2010limited and it results in a long\u2010lasting immunity. 1 Since in many countries, like in Switzerland, a universal screening for toxoplasmosis has been dropped out, 1 care should be taken in counseling immunocompromised women during pregnancy.\n\nHere, we discuss the potential role of immunosuppressive treatments, such as adalimumab, in the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis and the importance of counseling before pregnancy.\n\nThe Case\n\nA 36\u2010year\u2010old Caucasian, gravida 2, para 1 pregnant woman was referred to the Obstetrics Service of the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) due to an abnormal fetal scan performed by her gynecologist at 26\u2009weeks gestation (WG). The exam showed 11\u2010mm right cerebral ventriculomegaly and multiple 4\u2010 to 5\u2010mm echogenic images of hyperechoic lesions in the cerebral parenchyma compatible with fetal infection. Her medical history was remarkable for ankylosing spondylitis for which she was treated with adalimumab for 4\u2009years until 5\u00a0months before conception. She was screened for TXP at 6 WG (Table\u00a01) and had positive IgG and IgM with a high avidity index compatible with TXP infection prior pregnancy. Her routine first\u2010trimester and 20\u2009weeks ultrasounds and the aneuploidy screening were normal. The fetal scan performed at HUG at 27 WG confirmed the lesions found by her gynecologists (Figure\u00a01). An IRM showed multiple subependymal T2\u2010weighted intense lesions in the right frontal and left temporal cerebral parenchyma as long as multiple cortical\u2013subcortical cystic T2\u2010weighted intense lesions in the left parieto\u2010occipital region. We performed then an amniocentesis searching for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and TXP infections by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) that become positive for the latter. The patient requested termination of pregnancy. The fetal autopsy showed hepatosplenomegaly, calcifications of the adrenal glands, and a T\u2010lymphocyte infiltration in the skeletal muscles. The placenta pathology study showed irregular villous dysmaturity, stage I sub\u2010chorionitis, and high stage of chronic villitis. The microscopy exam on brain tissue confirmed congenital TXP infection, with large necrotic and inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (Figure\u00a02).\n\nTABLE 1 Toxoplasmosis serology and avidity results before, during, and after pregnancy\n\nAntibodies (method)\tUnity (reference values)\t6\u00a0months before conception\t6\u2009+\u20091\t12\u2009+\u20094 WG\t15\u2009+\u20094 WG\t20\u2009+\u20090 WG\t26\u2009days after TOP\t3\u00a0months after TOP\t6\u00a0months after TOP\t\nIgM (ECLIA)\t<0.80\u20130.99\t\t1.51\t1.32\t1.11\t1.29\t1.00\t0.92\t0.84\t\nIgM (CMIA)\t<0.50\u20130.60\t1.83\t1.65\t1.32\t1.17\t1.28\t1.39\t1.24\t1.25\t\nIgM (ELFA)\t<0.55\t1.37\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIgG (ECLIA)\t<1.00\u20133.00\t\t3650\t5080\t5960\t6200\t24\u2009600\t28\u2009000\t22\u2009000\t\nIgG (CMIA)\t<1.60\u20132.99\t>200\t306\t329\t361\t390\t1340\t1480\t1180\t\nIgG (ELFA)\t<4.0\t>300\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIgG avidity a\t60%\t22\t69.4\t73.7\t\u2014\t\u2014\t\u2014\t\u2014\t\t\nNote: Data are given in international units/milliliter (IU/mL) unless otherwise stated.\n\nAbbreviations: CMIA, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay; ECLIA, electrochemiluminescence immunoassay; ELFA, enzyme\u2010linked fluorescence assay; Ig, immunoglobulin; TOP, termination of pregnancy; WG, weeks of gestation.\n\na (Architect).\n\nFigure 1 Transabdominal ultrasound performed at 27 GW.

She recalled having asthenia and myalgia 1 month before conception lasting less than a week with no fever. She did not recall any signs or symptoms compatible with toxoplasma infection at that time or before. The patient had no contact with cats and therefore the probable mode of transmission was foodborne.\n\nWe performed a retrospective TXP serology evaluation including Architect and Cobas IgM and IgG serologies and avidity tests on stored blood samples of the patient to find out the moment of the TXP primary infection (Table\u00a01). The patient had contracted the TXP infection 6\u20137 months before conception when she was on adalimumab treatment. The IgG titers continued to increase for more than a year after infection.\n\nThe patient signed an informed consent for anonymous publication of this case report. A copy is available to the corresponding author.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTXP is a common worldwide infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. It is transmitted to humans mostly by ingestion of raw or undercooked infected meat that contains tissue cysts and by contact with cat feces, contaminated soil, and litter boxes during pregnancy. 1\n\nIn Switzerland, with its 73\u2009000 live births per year, approximately 130 women develop primary TXP during pregnancy, with 32 cases of congenital infection annually. 2 Congenital TXP causes brain, eye, heart, liver lesions, miscarriage, and intrauterine fetal demise. The risk of vertical transmission increases with gestational age (15% during the first trimester, 60%\u201390% during the third trimester), although the severity of fetal morbidity decreases with gestational age. 3 The risk of vertical transmission when infection happens prior pregnancy (3\u00a0months) and in the first weeks of pregnancy is extremely low. 4\n\nCongenital TXP infection usually results from a primary infection that happens during pregnancy or exceptionally during the 3 months before conception in a seronegative woman, but it can also be due to secondary infection (reactivation of latent infection or reinfection) in an immunocompromised pregnant woman. 5\n\nScreening and diagnosis rely on serological tests. Specific IgM antibodies signal the presence of an acute infection. These antibodies have excellent sensitivity, but low specificity 3 as they can last for several months 6 after resolution of the acute infection. It is recommended to use the avidity test of TXP\u2010specific IgG antibodies to date the timing of infection when IgM and IgG antibodies are positive during the first trimester. The presence of a high avidity indicates that the infection happened at least 3\u20135\u00a0months earlier. 6 In the case of our patient, who was tested at 6 WG, the avidity was high meaning that the primary infection occurred at least 2\u00a0months prior conception and that the risk of congenital infection was supposed to be extremely low. In fact, she had got the infection more than 6\u00a0months prior conception (Table\u00a01) when on treatment with biologics.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) infection, use of immunosuppressive drugs or even type 2 diabetes during pregnancy are well\u2010known risk factors for vertical transmission of TXP. 7 , 8 , 9 Our patient had been treated with adalimumab (Humira, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA) for almost 4\u2009years and until 5 months before conception. Adalimumab is a recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is an anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) immunosuppressant commonly used for autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid polyarthritis, Chron's disease, psoriasis among others. It induces suppression of one of the primary mechanisms involved in the clearance of T. gondii\u2014the Th1\u2010type immune response mediated by TNF\u03b1 and interleukin\u201012. 10 Several studies have shown an increased risk of reactivation of chronic hepatitis C and opportunistic infections (i.e., tuberculosis, granulomatous fungal infection, invasive aspergillosis, CMV, Epstein\u2013Barr virus), in patients using anti\u2010TNF\u03b1 agents, including adalimumab. 11 Its half\u2010life is 14\u2009days, 12 however, the delay for the immune system to totally recover after stopping the drug is not well known. Immunosuppressed women with HIV infection are strictly followed for risk of TXP complications when the CD4 levels are low. Unfortunately, there are no such markers for patients on anti\u2010TNF\u03b1 drugs.\n\nOur patient acquired the infection while on adalimumab, as indicated by the low avidity result (22) at 6\u00a0months prior conception. Even though the treatment was stopped about 1\u00a0month after the infection, its on\u2010going effect on the immune system had probably allowed for persistent parasitemia for more than 6\u00a0months which resulted in the fetal infection. The gynecologist was reassured as the IgG avidity was high at 6\u2009weeks of gestation. On the other hand, the IgG titers were very high and this has been shown to be associated with a high risk of vertical transmission among women with primary infection 13 Moreover, very high IgG levels could reflect the presence of severe or disseminated disease. 13\n\nThe debate about TXP screening during pregnancy is still ongoing in Europe. Switzerland does not recommend screening since 2010 following the recommendation of the Swiss Working Group on congenital TXP and the Eurotoxo project. 1 A cord blood screening program from 1982 until 2015 showed a continuous decrease in seroprevalence from 53% to 20% and in the incidence of congenital TXP from 0.08% to 0.012%, 2 suggesting that the no\u2010screening policy is justified. Despite the current Swiss recommendations, a recent study showed that 24.1% of private gynecologists caring for pregnant women systematically screen for TXP and that 32.9% are willing to screen for TXP infection upon the patient's demand. 14\n\nOn the other hand, the interpretation of serology tests can be challenging in the presence of immunosuppression. Increasing and very high IgG titers may represent a lack of protective immunity, which can lead to fetal infection, even in the presence of high avidity.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of congenital TXP infection in a woman on adalimumab who had become infected >6\u00a0months before pregnancy. The strategies currently used to evaluate the risk of congenital infection, including high IgG avidity, might not be satisfactory in women on immunosuppressive therapy, even when the treatment had been stopped several months before conception. Also, women are recommended to wait for at least 3\u00a0months after primary TXP infection before attempting conception. In immunocompromised women or among those on immunosuppressive drugs such as adalimumab, the delay should be longer.\n\nEducation, primary prevention, and routine surveillance should be reinforced among childbearing age women treated with immunosuppressive medications. We recommend increasing the interval to attempt conception after primary infection and to cautiously interpret the results of the serology when the IgG titers are very high, even in the presence of high avidity.\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nNone declared.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nEK and GT: wrote the manuscript and made research with support of EBE JMP and BMT.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nSecondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Complicated by a Cavitary Lung Lesion in a Kidney Transplant Recipient.\n\nABSTRACT:\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon life-threatening condition caused by an uncontrolled immunological response. It can develop secondary to malignancies, infections, systemic diseases, and immunosuppression. Multiple risk factors may present in kidney transplant recipients; however, the cases of HLH in this population have been described sparsely. We report a case of a 39-year-old female kidney transplant recipient who presented to the hospital nearly 3.5 years after the transplantation with general malaise, recent history of weight loss, fevers, and persistent anemia. Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and increased activity of lactate dehydrogenase. A bone marrow aspiration revealed hemophagocytosis, which led to the diagnosis of HLH. Therapy consisting of high-dose steroids and plasma exchanges was administered, resulting in a significant improvement of blood count parameters and the patient's general condition. While searching for the triggering disease, a single cavitary lesion in the right lung was revealed in a chest radiograph. Computed tomography scan, bronchoscopy, and additional laboratory testing did not reveal a definitive cause of the lesion. We suspect that the lesion may be a consequence of HLH. The patient was disqualified from thoracic surgery due to multiple comorbidities. Even though HLH is a rare condition, it should be taken into consideration in a kidney transplant patient presenting with unspecific symptoms accompanied by a bicytopenia. It has an unpredictable course that often results in serious complications. Thus close follow-up of the patient and a wide array of imaging and laboratory tests remain crucial.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) also known as the hemophagocytic syndrome is a rare, life-threatening condition caused by an ineffective and uncontrolled immunological response [1, 2]. At the core of HLH, pathophysiology lies a defective cytotoxic function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer lymphocytes. Even though immune system reacts to antigens, it may be unable to eliminate them. Additionally, both the modulation and termination of the immunological response in HLH are impaired. This leads to an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by the systemic proliferation of histiocytes [1, 3].\n\nHLH can be classified into a primary and a secondary form. The primary HLH is caused by a variety of genetic mutations, which directly affect cytotoxic function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. It typically presents in children. The secondary HLH (sHLH) can occur at any age, with no clear genetic background, usually in presence of conditions or factors that cause either a strong activation of immune system or immunodeficiency [1, 3]. Although sHLH is considered to be a distinct entity, recent studies show a possible correlation between a primary and secondary form of HLH [2, 4]. Most common sHLH triggering conditions are, in order, malignancies, systemic infections, and autoimmune diseases [2]. Rarely, it can present in patients receiving a strong immunosuppression, including bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients.\n\nIn the course of hyperinflammation and aggressive histiocyte infiltrates, massive tissue damage and hematological disturbances ensue. Signs and symptoms of HLH are nonspecific, which makes prompt diagnosis difficult even for experienced clinicians [2].\n\nWe present the development and clinical course of sHLH in a kidney transplant recipient. The literature on the subject has been scarce [5, 6, 7, 8], with the biggest series involving 17 cases of sHLH among a cohort of 4,230 kidney graft recipients [9]. Our case was complicated by the pulmonary lesion different from the typical complications observed in HLH. There have been only singular case reports describing somewhat similar changes in lungs in the course of hyperinflammatory syndromes [10, 11].\n\nCase Report\n\nA 39-year-old female kidney transplant recipient was admitted to our hospital in September 2018 (Fig. 1) due to general malaise, weight loss, fevers up to 38.5\u00b0C, diarrhea, and moderate anemia in follow-up laboratory tests. Her primary renal disease was lupus nephritis with kidney involvement resulting in end-stage renal disease. For this reason, she was on hemodialysis for 3 years while being prepared for the transplantation. The patient received a renal graft from a deceased donor in March 2016. A kidney biopsy was performed in August 2018, and its histopathological examination showed no signs of either transplant rejection or drug toxicity. High antinuclear antibody count (including elevated anti-double-stranded DNA antibody count) and low C3 and C4 complement components suggested SLE as the cause of the graft failure, despite an ongoing triple immunosuppressive treatment. Aside from that, patient's medical history included the very intensive courses of immunosuppresion including cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A and pulses of intravenous steroids. The patient also suffered from cytomegalovirus (CMV) early after transplantation and a recurrent CMV infection in August 2018.\n\nOn the admission, the immunosuppressive regimen consisted of mycophenolate sodium, tacrolimus, and prednisone. The patient was also receiving valganciclovir due to the recent CMV infection. The physical examination showed the signs of dehydration and an enlarged single left submandibular node. The routine laboratory tests revealed the signs of pancytopenia (hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL; leukocyte count 1.91 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L; and platelet count 117 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L) and renal failure with metabolic acidosis (serum creatinine 462.5 \u03bcmol/L; urea 31.9 mmol/L and pH 7.153; and sHCO3\u2212 11.8 mEq/L). Serum C-reactive protein level was within normal range. The abdominal ultrasound was significant only for gallbladder polyps and revealed a single cyst in the upper pole of the transplanted kidney and an accessory spleen. No enlargement of internal organs was seen. The intravenous fluid therapy was promptly started, resulting in a partial improvement of graft function. Since we considered valganciclovir as a potential cause of pancytopenia, CMV-DNA laboratory test was carried out and upon receiving a negative result the drug was discontinued. One unit of leukoreduced and irradiated blood was transfused, and the patient received a single dose of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and 2 doses of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Despite all this, no significant improvement of blood count was observed (Fig. 2). Among numerous other laboratory tests performed 3 were especially worthy of attention, that is, increased activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (341 U/L), elevated triglycerides (2.35 mmol/L), and highly increased serum ferritin (>2,000 ng/mL). The patient was then transferred to the Hematology Clinic, where she had a bone marrow aspiration performed. The histopathological examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed an intensive hemophagocytosis which alongside the aforementioned laboratory and clinical findings raised a suspicion of sHLH.\n\nAfter the patient returned to our nephrology ward in October 2018, the possible treatment plans were discussed. Etoposide therapy was considered inordinately toxic given the presence of graft failure and hypoalbuminemia (25 g/L). The immunosuppressive regimen was modified, and tacrolimus was converted to everolimus and oral prednisone to an intravenous dexamethasone. Based on the available literature, plasma exchange (PE) therapy was initiated. In total, 4 PEs were performed, resulting in a remarkable improvement of blood count parameters (Fig. 2) and the patient's general condition.\n\nIn search for a potential cause of sHLH CMV-DNA and Epstein Barr Virus DNA (EBV-DNA), tests were performed. The results of both tests were positive with 1.25 \u00d7 103 copies/mL EBV-DNA and CMV-DNA detectable levels but too low to estimate the viral load. Hence, intravenous ganciclovir was started. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist who suggested a possible SLE exacerbation based on newly presented oral ulcers, right wrist pain, bilateral Reynaud's phenomenon, and previously described signs of renal failure present in laboratory tests. Gastrointestinal malignancies were ruled out after negative results of colonoscopy and gastroscopy. Lastly, a chest radiograph was taken, revealing a single cavitary lesion in the right lung which was not present in the previous radiograph (Fig. 3). Following that, a computed tomography was performed and precise measurements were taken (Fig. 4). According to the radiologist, the observed lesion presented no active inflammation and it was most likely post-inflammatory, although it could also be caused by tuberculosis. At the moment sustained therapy with reduced doses of immunosuppressants and follow-up of the lesion progression was deemed the reasonable approach. The patient was discharged from the hospital with frequent follow-up visits at our outpatient clinic.\n\nIn January 2019, a significant enlargement of the lung lesion was noticed in a chest radiograph (Fig. 3). At this point, a preemptive therapy for the mycobacterium tuberculosis would be useful for the diagnosis; however, it was not administered. Instead, the patient was referred to a pulmonologist, who raised a suspicion of the fungal pulmonary infection. A bronchofiberoscopy was performed, which did not reveal any macroscopic changes. The samples for bacterial and fungal cultures, BK-virus test, Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture, and PCR-DNA were taken. At the same time, blood galactomannan level was also assessed. All these test results came negative. The patient was also referred to a thoracic surgeon who advised an active monitoring of the lesion with no immediate indication for its surgical removal. In the following months, chest radiographs and CT scans showed a slow increase of the size of the cavitary lesion with the thickening of its wall (Fig. 4).\n\nAt the same time, the patient suffered from a prolonged course of sHLH. High levels of ferritin, that is, 2,761 ng/mL in January 2019; 1,149 ng/mL in June 2019; and 1,946 ng/mL in August 2019, and cytopenia affecting from 1 to 3 cell lines were observed during subsequent hospitalizations. The patient had additional courses of PE performed from November 2018 to June 2019\u201317 in total. Moreover, 2 courses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy were necessary to maintain disease control. Due to high serum creatinine and urea levels in follow-up laboratory tests, the patient had a second graft biopsy performed in August 2019. The histopathological examination revealed the signs of tubulointerstitial graft rejection and coexisting thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\nIn September 2019, a further progression and consolidation in lung CT within the cavity wall was observed; therefore, the patient was referred to a pulmonary disease center. There, a second bronchofiberoscopy was performed which included bronchoalveolar lavage and carinal forceps biopsy. Since changes of the lesion observed in CT were highly suspicious for pulmonary fungal infection, the patient was started on voriconazole. Another set of samples for bacterial, fungal, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures was taken. Cytological examination of the lavage fluid revealed increased amount of neutrophils (11.3% of all counted leukocytes, with normal range <3%); distribution of the other leukocyte populations, including macrophages, was normal; however, the histopathologist observed signs of activation and phagocytosis in some of the macrophages; additionally, numerous erythrocytes, sparse bacteria, and sparse fungi hyphae were described in the sample. Examination of the specimen from the carinal biopsy showed active inflammation within the mucosa with no fungi hyphae. Bacterial cultures were positive for Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mitis, cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungi were once again negative. Antibiotic therapy was administered according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing results.\n\nShe was initially qualified to thoracic surgery, but due to severe flu, zoster, and graft failure, the procedure has been postponed. As the graft function gradually worsened, the patient returned to hemodialysis in April 2020.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAccording to the available literature, sHLH has been most commonly associated with malignancies in about half of the reported cases \u2013 followed by the systemic infections and autoimmune diseases [6]. It has been much less prevalent in patients on immunosuppressive therapy [5, 12]. In a population of kidney transplant recipients, the most commonly identifiable cause of sHLH was viral infections, mainly EBV and CMV [6]. Nearly all of the reported cases were diagnosed in the first few months following the surgery when the most intensive immunosuppressive regimen was required. In comparison, our patient developed sHLH 3.5 years after the surgery. There have been only a few documented cases of post-kidney transplant patient developing sHLH late after the transplantation [6, 8, 9]. Specifying the exact pathophysiology of sHLH in our case poses a great challenge. In light of the mentioned statistical data and given that the patient's EBV-DNA and CMV-DNA tests came positive, a viral infection seems to be the most probable cause. However, at the time of diagnosis in September 2018, the patient suffered from SLE with a possible exacerbation. She was also strictly complying to the immunosuppressive treatment. It cannot be overlooked that these are recognized as individual, potential sHLH causes.\n\nEstablishing the diagnosis of HLH is complicated due to a nonspecific syndrome-like clinical picture and signs and symptoms that often overlap with those of the diseases triggering it [2]. The patients generally present with a high fever and a variety of clinical abnormalities: hepatosplenomegaly, gastrointestinal symptoms, signs of central nervous system involvement, cough and dyspnea, less often rash, and superficial node enlargement [3, 6, 9]. Laboratory diagnostics usually reveal cytopenia in 2 or more cell lines, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. Often present, but much less specific are elevated levels of C-reactive protein, LDH, transaminases and D-dimer, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia [1, 2]. Our case illustrates how misleading sHLH presentation could be, in particular in a transplant patient. At the admission, our patient reported only fevers and the physical examination revealed only a single enlarged lymph node. Initial laboratory testing showed cytopenia in all 3 cell lines and renal graft failure. It is of note that pancytopenia in the graft recipients can be caused by immunosuppressants or by CMV infection or the drugs used to treat CMV, that is, the factors that are common in this group of patients [6]. Only when further diagnostics revealed a constellation of severe hyperferritinemia and elevated triglycerides alongside the increased activity of LDH and hypoalbuminemia, a suspicion of hyperinflammatory syndrome could be raised. The final step in establishing the diagnosis was a bone marrow aspiration, which revealed intensive hemophagocytosis (it should be noted that for given specimen histopathological description the changes in blood morphology, although worrisome, were relatively mild). Hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow is considered to be the hallmark of HLH. Majority of patients with HLH will have a bone marrow biopsy performed due to the cytopenia and often, like in our case, it is the histopathological examination of the specimen revealing hemophagocytosis that suggests HLH. However, it is neither very sensitive nor the specific sign since its prevalence among the patients with HLH varies from 25 to 100% and may be found in many other inflammatory conditions, such as sepsis, severe infections, and systemic diseases [1, 2, 7].\n\nBoth the primary and sHLH can be initially treated using the same protocol introduced in HLH-2004 study. Nevertheless, in sHLH patients, a treatment of the triggering disease should be considered as the top priority [1, 2, 6, 13]. In our patient, we had to take into account all of the potential causes. The patient was diagnosed with EBV and CMV infection and was given intravenous ganciclovir. Furthermore, an exacerbation of SLE was suspected, but we decided that the immunosuppressive treatment should not be intensified due to multiple coexisting diseases.\n\nThe recommendations for the management of HLH in post-renal transplant patients remain to be specified. It is advised to reduce an immunosuppressive treatment since first, the underlying immunosuppression is a known sHLH risk factor, and second, the majority of sHLH cases in this population has been associated with a viral infection and the reduction of the doses of immunosuppressive drugs may enhance the resistance to the pathogen [6]. The available literature includes a suggestion to stop every immunosuppressive drug with an exception to high-dose steroids [6]. In our case, we decided to continue both everolimus and mycophenolate sodium due to a high risk of transplant rejection in our patient considering her comorbidities, persistent high serum creatinine and urea in follow-up laboratory tests and, later, signs of rejection in graft biopsy. The administration of IVIG is considered a viable treatment escalation option. If patient does not respond to the therapy, etoposide, leukocytopheresis, or plasmapheresis may prove effective according to the anecdotal evidence [6, 7]. In our center, we decided to perform PE, and after the first 4 sessions, we saw a large improvement in patient's general condition and laboratory markers. Our patient could benefit from PE in 2 ways: 1 being the suppression of sHLH and the other potentially being removal of autoantibodies connected with SLE \u2013 it should not be forgotten that the clinical picture at the time suggested SLE exacerbation. Despite the initial partial recovery, in subsequent months further courses of PE had to be performed with additional administration of IVIG. Mortality rate due to sHLH mortality may reach 30\u201350% in the general population but could be much higher in immunocompromised patients such as after organ transplantation [6].\n\nWhat sets this case apart from other cases with sHLH in post-renal transplant patients is the cavitary lesion in right lung that was discovered while searching for the possible triggering condition. It is suspected that the lung involvement may be present in almost half of patients with HLH [10, 14]; however, detailed descriptions of the lesions in those patients have been sparse. Radiographs usually portrayed changes like interstitial infiltrates, atelectasis, consolidations, ground-glass opacities, pleural effusions, and mediastinal lymphadenopathies. Some of these findings might have resulted from causes other than HLH itself, such as infections, heart failure, fluid overload, and malignancies [14, 15]. Infiltration of the pulmonary tissues by the histiocytes, although possible, is an extremely rare instance. There was only 1 case report of sHLH in which the intravascular pulmonary histiocytosis was described, manifesting as bilateral pulmonary nodules in a CT scan [10]. Another case report presented a patient with macrophage activation syndrome \u2013 a twin-like condition to HLH \u2013 with an excavated nodule observed in CT scan and macrophage infiltrates in transbronchial lung biopsy [11].\n\nThe cavitary lesion found in our patient did not match any of the typical radiological findings, but it bears some similarities with the excavated nodule in the macrophage activation syndrome patient described by Brand\u00e3o-Neto et al. [11]. It may also resemble the changes typical for pulmonary fungal infection \u2013 it should be noted that pulmonary fungal infection and sHLH coexistence have already been described [16, 17] \u2013 but considering the negative fungal cultures, this explanation is unlikely to be correct. Since the cavitary lung lesion in our patient was not present before the sHLH onset, we suspect that it developed as a complication of sHLH. The thoracic surgery and histopathological examination of the specimen would bring a definite answer regarding its etiology. Nevertheless, at the moment of writing this report, it is uncertain whether the benefits from such operation would outweigh the risks. Unless any further enlargement of the lesion or pulmonary complications occur, the potential surgery is being put on hold.\n\nsHLH remains a poorly understood condition, and further research in its diagnostics and treatment is warranted. As reflected by our case, the course of sHLH can be unpredictable and challenging, in particular especially in the immunocompromised post-renal transplant patients. It is important to take sHLH into consideration in the organ transplant recipients presenting with unspecific symptoms accompanied by bicytopenia or sepsis-like clinical picture. When sHLH diagnosis is established, the vast array of laboratory and imaging tests need to be performed in order to identify the underlying condition and potential complications. The treatment should be administered as soon as possible utilizing the protocols that have been proven successful in sHLH patient population.\n\nStatement of Ethics\n\nInformed written consent was obtained from the patient for being described in this case report and for publication of any accompanying images.

Pseudomembranous colitis is a serious complication of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) after septic surgery and antibacterial therapy. A sudden white blood cell (WBC) count increase and extremely high leucocytosis may be a predictor of a poor outcome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 77 years old male was hospitalised because of lower leg osteomyelitis and was operated. He received antibacterial treatment with Cefazolin for three days and then developed a high WBC count. The course of the disease was fulminant, with a rapid increase in the WBC count up to 132,000/mm3 and a septic shock, and required cardiovascular and ventilatory support. The patient was started on intravenous Metronidazole (500\u202fmg every eight hours) and oral Vancomycin (500\u202fmg every six hours). The patient's condition gradually improved over a period of six days. Then a hyperthermia above 39 degrees Celsius, hypotension and painful abdominal bloating developed, and the WBC count peaked to 186,000/mm3. The blood cultures were positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient died.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn our case, we describe a community-onset, healthcare-facility-associated, severe CDI complicated by a blood stream infection. The administration of oral Vancomycin, which is highly active against the intestinal flora, could have been responsible for the persistence and overgrowth of Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSevere CDIs after orthopaedic surgery and antibacterial treatment complicated by the development of nosocomial infection significantly worsen the prognosis of the disease. Careful consideration of antibacterial therapy and early symptom recognition may help prevent catastrophic events.\n\nTEXT:\n1 Introduction\nClostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated infections, with high morbidity and mortality rates. Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium. Clostridium difficile toxins can cause severe complications, including non-stopping diarrhoea, pseudomembranous colitis (PMC), toxic megacolon, perforations of the colon and sepsis [[1], [2], [3], [4]].\n\nA sudden increase in white blood cell (WBC) count coinciding in asymptomatic patients who receive antibacterial therapy after septic surgery may be a predictor of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, while extremely high leucocytosis may be a predictor of a poor outcome [5].\n\nMeta-analyses suggest that exposure to several antibiotic categories, including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, penicillins, macrolides and sulphonamides/trimethoprim, is associated with an increased risk of CDI in adults [5].\n\nSevere CDIs are often complicated by the development of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs) that significantly worsen the prognosis of the disease. Candida or enteric bacteria for the most part cause BSIs, and the mortality rate associated with this infection is very high \u2013 up to 50 % [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10]].\n\nThe aim of this paper is to report a fatal case of orthopaedic surgery complicated by Clostridium difficile infection and bloodstream Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.\n\nThe case report was written according to SCARE guidelines [11,12].\n\n2 Presentation of case\nA 77 years old male with a medical history of hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischaemic attacks and chronic kidney disease was admitted at the ICU because of an altered mental state and cardiovascular collapse. The patient was afebrile and stuporous, with a pulse rate of 110 bpm and white blood cell count of 100,440/mm3. The level of haemoglobin was 73\u202fg/L and of C-reactive protein \u2013 251\u202fmg/L. Urinalysis was unremarkable.\n\nThe patient was hospitalised six days earlier due to left tibia chronic osteomyelitis that had developed after osteosynthesis with a locked intramedullary nail seven years ago. The patient presented with stable infected pseudarthrosis, bone resorption around the nail and locking screws, abscess in soft tissue and a healed fibula fracture. The patient has not had any surgical treatment due to infection before, except abscess incision. He had not been taking any prescription antimicrobial agents at home. Two days after admission the patient was operated. Under general anaesthesia in supine position, using a tourniquet on the thigh, the following steps were performed: wound revision, implant removal, bone channel reaming, rinsing and antibiotic-loaded cement nail and spacer implantation. Surgery was performed by a trauma surgeon specialising in bone and joint infections. Analyses from the bone infection site revealed Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient received antibacterial therapy with Cefazolin 1\u202fg every six hours for three days after the surgery and then suddenly developed an elevated WBC count of up to 54,000/mm3 without any concomitant symptoms.\n\nThe course of the disease was fulminant, with a rapid increase in the WBC count up to 133,420/mm3 and a septic shock. Oro-tracheal intubation and fluid resuscitation were performed, followed by intravenous norepinephrine and cardiovascular and ventilatory support. Flow cytometry was done for the purpose of differential diagnosis, to exclude a malignant haematological disease. Blood culture was negative. Promisingly, a positive Clostridium difficile A and B toxin test was obtained from stool. The patient was started on intravenous Metronidazole (500\u202fmg IV every eight hours) and oral Vancomycin (500\u202fmg every six hours).\n\nFollowing five days of treatment the patient\u2019s condition gradually improved. Then, suddenly, a hyperthermia above 39 degrees Celsius, shivering, hypotension and painful abdominal bloating developed. The WBC count peaked to 186,230/mm3 (Table 1). The rapidly developing, unstable haemodynamics required increasing doses of vasopressors. An urgent CT scan was performed, and neither open air, nor fluid were found in the abdomen. The consulting abdominal surgeon refused surgical intervention. The patient died 20\u202fh after the beginning of the episode concerned. The microbiological blood cultures collected before death showed Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to some antibacterial drugs, such as cephalosporins.Table 1 Laboratory investigations in the course of the disease.\n\nTable 1Day\tWBC\n/mm3\tCRP\nmg/L\tMicrobiology\tLactate\nlevel\nmmol/L\tAlbumin level\ng/L\tSerum\ncreatinine\nmkmol/L\tGFR\nmL/min/1.73\u202fm2\tSOFA\nScore\npoints\t\n0\t54,840\t154\t\t\t\t173\t35\t\t\n1\n(admitted at\nICU)\t100,440\n132,420\t251\tCl.

The antibiotic treatment disrupts the normal colonic microbiota, making individuals susceptible to CDI [13].\n\nData on the antibiotic therapy within the previous 30 days as well as other risk factors for the multidrug-resistant organisms were gathered from the discharge letter and summary from the previous hospitalisation in other facilities. These data were negative [[1], [2], [3],14].\n\nWe can assume that this patient was an asymptomatic carrier since the previous hospitalisation episodes, despite the fact that the last episode was five years ago [14,15].\n\nTypically at our surgical wards we start treatment with oral Metronidazole if a patient has unexplained diarrhoea, leucocytosis and subfebrile temperature, and we start empirical treatment with intravenous Metronidazole (500\u202fmg IV every eight hours) and oral Vancomycin (125\u2013500\u202fmg every six hours) at the Intensive Care Unit when the symptoms worsen [5].\n\nThe more rapidly the life-threatening symptoms occur, the more motivated clinicians become to initiate early and intensive empirical treatment [16].\n\nThe recommended treatment for first recognised episodes is stratified based on the severity (mild to moderate or severe) of CDI assessed by WBC count (above or below 15,000 cells/mm3), serum creatinine level (1.5 times the pre-morbid level), hypotension or shock, ileus and megacolon, which are characteristic of a severe, complicated (a.k.a. fulminant) CDI [17].\n\nWe followed the recommendation for an initial fulminant episode with hypotension and shock: Vancomycin 500\u202fmg four times a day via nasogastric tube and Metronidazole 500\u202fmg every eight hours intravenously. Gastric bypassing was applied [5].\n\nNeutrophils are the first cells recruited to the colon in response to a CDI, and the neutrophil response is believed to be a determinant of the severity of the disease. Autopsy showed extremely dense leukocyte infiltration in tissues.\n\nThe production of neutrophil growth factor in the inflamed tissue facilitates the initial migration of neutrophils from the bone marrow into peripheral circulation and the recruitment of neutrophils to the CDI site. Neutrophil-mediated inflammation and neutrophil activity itself can lead to immune-mediated damage of host tissues [18].\n\nThe following parameters had the most evidence to support their use as markers of risk for mortality in CDI when assessed at or near the time of diagnosis: age, most likely with a cut-off between >65 and 75 years; WBC, with a cut-off of >20,000/mm3; serum creatinine, possibly with a cut-off of >200\u202fmmol/L; and serum albumin, most likely with a cut-off of <25 to 35\u202fg/L [17].\n\nThe impact of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (BSIs) in complicating CDIs is huge [10]. The alterations occurring in the intestinal flora, which represents a microbiome, can promote the translocation of pathogens into the blood stream and the development of nosocomial BSIs. The most common aetiology is the Candida species (47.3 %), followed by enterobacteria (19.4 %), mixed infections, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.4 %), and enterococci (13.9 %) [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10]].\n\nIn the case presented here the administration of oral Vancomycin, which is highly active against the intestinal flora, could have been responsible for the persistence and overgrowth of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n4 Conclusions\nWe can assume that extremely high leucocytosis was a factor for unfavourable prognosis. The gut inflammatory injury caused by the severe CDI may be considered as the \u201csecond hit,\u201d allowing the bacterial translocation and BSI. Careful consideration of antibacterial therapy and early symptom recognition may help prevent catastrophic events.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors report no declarations of interest.\n\nFunding\nNo funding received for this article.\n\nEthical approval\nThe case report was approved by the Ethical Board of the Hospital of Traumatology and Orthopaedics, Riga, Latvia, Statement of 20 November 2020.\n\nConsent\nInformed consent could not be obtained as the patient died in the course of the disease.\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the Chief Physician of the Hospital of Traumatology and Orthopaedics for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

We present here a young infant with an inborn error of immunity (IEI) who developed fatal adverse events to this live-attenuated vaccine. This male infant received BCG (Serum Institute of India Pvt., Ltd., India) on Day 11 of life. On Day 25, he developed fever, followed by cervical lymphadenitis and bilateral otitis media with fluid drainage. On Day 118, he was admitted with severe hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and passed away on Day 145. The diagnostic exome sequencing test identified a hemizygous nonsense variant, NM_000397.3(CYBB):c.676C>T, p.Arg226* (rs137854592). Pathogenic variants of CYBB [cytochrome b(-245), beta subunit; Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] accession code, 300481] are known to cause \"immunodeficiency 34, mycobacteriosis, X-linked\" (IMD34, MIM#300645) and \"chronic granulomatous disease, X-linked\" (CGDX, MIM#306400). The natural history of his illness is consistent with \"X-linked recessive Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD).\" This entity is responsible for his BCG disease and is a likely trigger of his HLH. This disastrous event underlines the importance of developing worldwide policies that target BCG disease prevention, especially in communities with high prevalence of IEI. Moreover, screening for genetic causes of MSMD in the community could pave the way, at least partially, for scale-up of tuberculosis (TB) prevention.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nBacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, a live vaccine derived from attenuated Mycobacterium bovis cultures, is administered to all newborns in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since 2005 (1). This practice has resulted in serious adverse events in our tribal communities, especially in children with unrevealed inborn error of immunity (IEI) (2, 3). Moreover, the BCG strains may also cause serious (often fatal) complications in \u201cMendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases\u201d (MSMD) (4). MSMD embraces inherited entities that result from both \u201cvirulent\u201d and \u201cfaintly virulent\u201d mycobacteria, including BCG vaccines (5, 6). An example of an MSMD-causing autosomal variant in our tribal communities is IFNGR2 (interferon-gamma receptor 2; MIM#147569):c.123C>G, p.Tyr41*, which results in \u201cimmunodeficiency 28, mycobacteriosis\u201d (IMD28; MIM#614889) (7). Examples of MSMD-causing X-linked pathogenic variants include CYBB:Gln231Pro (rs151344498), CYBB:Thr178Pro (rs151344497), and NM_000397.3(CYBB):c.1662dup, p.Glu555* (rs1453468510) (8\u201311). This case report describes serious adverse events of the BCG vaccine in a young infant with X-linked MSMD. Its main aim is to provide further justifications for establishing safe rules for BCG vaccination.\n\nCase Description\n\nThis male infant, an offspring of first-cousin parents, was born at 35 weeks' gestation by Cesarean delivery due to premature contractions. The mother was gravida 4, para 3. Her pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes (managed with insulin) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, treated with hydroxychloroquine). She was on prophylactic enoxaparin during the pregnancy. Otherwise, the family health history (parents, siblings, grandparents, uncles, and aunts, and first-degree cousins) was unremarkable, including negative exposure to known tuberculosis (TB) cases. His birth weight was 3,125 g. His postnatal period was complicated by respiratory distress that required neonatal intensive care supports for 11 days. BCG (0.05 ml, intradermal injection in the upper right arm [manufactured by Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd., India]) and hepatitis B pediatric [10 \u03bcg [0.5 ml] intramuscular injection] vaccines were then administered on Day 11 (the day of discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit, NICU). Thereafter, he developed unremitting fever (Figure 1A) and passed away on Day 145 (Table 1).\n\nFigure 1 (A) Axillary temperatures as function of age. The highest value per day is shown. The natural course of his disease is also depicted. D, dexamethasone; NICU, neonatal intensive care unit; HLH, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. He was inpatient during the highlighted periods.

On Day 96, he was readmitted for treatment of bilateral otitis media with yellow discharges and received again empiric antibiotics for 10 days. On Day 118, he was admitted with persistent high fever, massive/firm hepatosplenomegaly (spleen 10 cm below the left costal margin and liver down to the pelvis), skin rash, failure to gain weight, and an unhealed BCG injection site (Figure 3). Treatment for BCG disease was never received. On Day 140, he was started on dexamethasone (10 mg/m2/days, intravenously), as an empiric treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). He passed away on Day 145 of multiorgan (hepatic, respiratory, and renal) failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), Figure 2B.\n\nFigure 2 (A) Color Doppler images on neck ultrasound scan at age of 45 days demonstrates an enlarged left cervical lymph node of increased vascularity in keeping with lymphadenitis.

The BCG vaccination site measured about 5 mm; it was a wet papule with central yellow crust.\n\nDuring the last admission, his complete blood counts (CBC), blood film, lymphocyte subset, quantitative immunoglobulin, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy studies (morphology, cytogenetics, and flow cytometry; the results did not reveal active hemophagocytosis), skeletal scintigraphy, and echocardiography were unrevealing (Table 1). Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were negative. Neutrophil oxygen burst study was not done. Nasopharyngeal swabs for respiratory pathogens were negative by PCR, including coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\nInitial neck ultrasound scan confirmed presence of a cervical lymphadenitis with no evidence of fluid collection. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated hepatosplenomegaly, otherwise were unremarkable. Moderate ascites was demonstrated on follow-up ultrasound scan. Radiographically, he developed a progressive picture of acute respiratory syndrome.\n\nResults of his serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) are summarized in Figure 1B. Between Days 120 and 145, his serum triglyceride was (mean \u00b1 SD) 1.77 \u00b1 0.42 mmol/l (n = 5; normal 0.25\u20130.85), alanine transaminase (ALT) 202 unit/l (increased to 1,175 unit/l on Day 145; normal, \u2264 41), and ammonia 130 \u03bcmol/l (normal, 16\u201360). On Day 130, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was 5,386 pg/ml (reference values, 175\u2013858) and interleukin six was 50.6 pg/ml (normal, \u2264 7.0). On Day 143, a blood culture grew Staphylococcus haemolyticus. On Day 144, he developed refractory coagulopathy, including hypofibrinogenemia. On Day 147 (two days after he passed away), diagnostic exome sequencing revealed the pathogenic hemizygous variant NM_000397.3(CYBB):c.676C>T, p.Arg226* (rs137854592).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis young infant has the hemizygous pathogenic variant CYBB:p.Arg226* (rs137854592) and has received the BCG vaccine. Shortly thereafter, he developed BCG disease (fever with lymphadenitis) and progressed to severe HLH (systemic inflammation with massive hepatosplenomegaly due to lymphocyte proliferation). Thus, his HLH is likely triggered by the BCG disease. His treatment must be urgent and directed toward both the BCG disease and HLH. Delaying effective therapies (anti-BCG disease as well as standard HLH management) until a molecular diagnosis is evident is imprudent. It is well to know that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol are included in the BCG vaccine Package Insert (Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd., Pune, India).\n\nThe term \u201cMendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD)\u201d labels inherited entities that result from both \u201cvirulent\u201d and \u201cfaintly virulent\u201d mycobacteria, including BCG vaccines (12\u201314). CYBB (MIM#300481; X-linked) encodes for the beta-subunit of phagocyte NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase. Pathogenic variants of CYBB such as Gln231Pro (rs151344498) and Thr178Pro (rs151344497) have been identified within this clinical cluster (8). Hemizygous males with these variants have reduced macrophage oxidative burst (a variant of chronic granulomatous disease, CGD), but normal respiratory function in the granulocytes and monocytes. They become symptomatic after exposure to mycobacteria, and their disease has been labeled: \u201cX-linked recessive MSMD\u201d (8).\n\nPathogenic variants of CYBB, including CYBB:p.Arg226* and NM_000397.3(CYBB):c.1662dup, p.Glu555* (rs1453468510) (15), are associated with \u201cimmunodeficiency 34, mycobacteriosis, X-linked\u201d (IMD34; MIM#300645) and \u201cchronic granulomatous disease, X-linked\u201d (CGDX; MIM#306400) (10, 11). Arg226 is located near the C-terminus end of the fifth transmembrane helix of the protein, and a truncation (non-sense mutation) will delete the cytoplasmic dehydrogenase (DH) domain that consists of the FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH-binding domains (Figure 4). This deletion will also remove the last transmembrane helix of the protein, likely making it unable to fold or function as expected.\n\nFigure 4 Homology model of CYBB generated with SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) using the dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1; Protein Data Bank ID: 7D3E) structure as the template. The transmembrane region is shown in blue, FAD-binding domain in green, and NADPH-binding domain in orange. Arg226 is shown in space-filling representation.\n\nIt is also important to point out that the T cell function in these CYBB variants is expected to be unaltered. Therefore, a widespread TB disease is unlikely. The problem, rather, is an uncontrolled systemic inflammation, as seen in HLH (16).\n\nStudies are also needed to understand the contribution of IEI variants (i.e., MSMD) to TB disease in our community. Identifying and screening for such variants allow a safer BCG vaccination program and improve the TB screening in individuals at risk (17). Intense migration to UAE from TB endemic regions imposes high risk to the population, especially those with MSMD. In our population, the prevalence of latent TB infection (LTBI) in children is 0.45% and in adults 18.8% (8% among our medical students) (18\u201320). In addition, future studies are needed to determine whether the carrier state of CYBB:p.Arg226* could have contributed to the development of SLE in his mother.\n\nThis case report provides further justification for developing and implementing safe rules for BCG vaccination locally and internationally. It is the responsibility of health authorities to establish effective strategies that prevent improper vaccinations. This young infant emphasizes the need to take essential precautions before immunizing children and adults with live vaccines.\n\nIt is vital to emphasize the WHO position: \u201cBCG vaccination is contraindicated for persons with congenital cell-mediated or severe combined immunodeficiency\u201d (21). This statement, however, requires further clarification for risks associated with MSMD. Many of the severe forms of IEI manifest clinically in the first few months of life (22). Therefore, in some countries, the BCG vaccine is given to infants at a later age (23\u201325). Thus, we urge the authorities to refine their statement on BCG and include procedures that assure only healthy children receive the vaccine (26). A summary of the MSMD variants found in the UAE is shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Variants of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) found in the UAE.\n\n\u27a2 NM_000397.3(CYBB):c.676C>T, p.Arg226* (rs137854592) [this report].\n\u27a2 NM_000206.2(IL2RG):c.820_823dup p.Ser275Asnfs*29 (novel) causes X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (MIM#300400) [unpublished].\n\u27a2 NM_178443.2(FERMT3):c.1800G>A, p.Trp600* (novel) causes \u201cleukocyte adhesion deficiency, type III\u201d (LAD3, MIM#612840) [unpublished].\n\u27a2 NM_178443.2(FERMT3):c.2001del p.*668Glufs*106 (novel) causes \u201cleukocyte adhesion deficiency, type III\u201d (LAD3, MIM#612840) [unpublished].\n\u27a2 IFNGR2:c.123C>G, p.Tyr41*; causes \u201cimmunodeficiency 28, mycobacteriosis\u201d (IMD28; MIM#614889) [unpublished].\n\u27a2 NM_001287344.1(BTK):c.80G>A, p.Gly27Asp (novel), causes \u201cX-linked agammaglobulinemia\u201d (MIM#300755) (3).\n\u27a2 NM_000732.4 (CD3D):c.128G>A, p.Trp43*, causes \u201cimmunodeficiency type 19\u201d (MIM#615617) (3).\t\n\nConclusions\n\nWe conclude that \u201cBCG vaccine should be deferred until required precautions are legitimately dismissed.\u201d In addition, the \u201celectronic health systems\u201d should alert vaccination providers that \u201cThere should be no contraindication to the live vaccination before a dose can be requested.\u201d More importantly, \u201cparents should be well-informed and counseled that sharing critical information with the vaccination providers is essential.\u201d These preliminary measures are easy to implement, while awaiting wise policies on BCG vaccination (27\u201329).\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.\n\nEthics Statement\n\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Tawam Human Research Ethics Committee.

MRI of the head showed linear perivascular enhancement in the midbrain and the basal ganglia. Despite treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, plasma exchange, IV immunoglobulins, and cyclophosphamide, he died with devastating neurologic complications. Autopsy revealed a coexistent neuroendocrine tumor in the small intestine and diffuse inflammation in the brain parenchyma, perivascular spaces, and leptomeninges, with predominant T-cells, macrophages, and activated microglia. B-cells and plasma cells were absent. There was no astrocyte involvement with change in GFAP immunostaining.\n\n\n\nThis case illustrates autoimmune meningoencephalomyelitis associated with GFAP antibody in the CSF and coexistent neuroendocrine tumor. The autopsy findings were nonspecific and did not demonstrate astrocyte involvement. Further accumulation of cases is warranted to delineate the utility and pathogenic significance of the GFAP autoantibody.\n\nTEXT:\npmcCase\n\nA 70-year-old Caucasian man with dyslipidemia and depression presented to the emergency department with hand tremors for several months, progressive imbalance and falls, confusion, and insomnia for 2 weeks. He was alert and oriented with psychomotor slowing, with a temperature of 37.5\u00b0C, tachycardia of 109 beats per minute, and restlessness. Neurologic examination revealed increased tone in the neck and the left leg, diffuse myoclonic jerks, bilateral endpoint tremor, and symmetric hyperreflexia. Admission laboratory test results were significant for mild leukocytosis of 12.1 \u00d7 103/mL and hyponatremia of 126 mEq/L; thyroid stimulating hormone, glucose, urinalysis, and creatine kinase were normal. CT head was unremarkable.\n\nInitially, serotonin syndrome from concurrent bupropion and citalopram use was suspected, and cyproheptadine was started. However, he became lethargic and febrile (39.1\u00b0C) on day 2 of admission, requiring endotracheal intubation. CSF analysis on day 2 showed lymphocytic leukocytosis (nucleated cells 120/mm3) and elevated protein (167 mg/dL). Abbreviated hospital course is shown in Figure 1. Hyponatremia was corrected with fluid resuscitation and cessation of citalopram not requiring prolonged fluid restriction. MRI of the head showed linear symmetric perivascular enhancement in bilateral crus cerebri and basal ganglia that were not present 10 days before admission (Figure 2, A\u2013C), as well as thin subdural fluid collections in the posterior convexity concerning for subdural empyema and meningitis (Figure 2D). Magnetic resonance angiogram of the head was normal. MRI of the thoracic spine on day 6 showed long segment thoracic cord signal abnormalities with a possible enhancement (Figure 2F). Extensive infectious and rheumatological assessments were negative. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was not performed because this presentation occurred before the pandemic.\n\nFigure 1 Schema of Hospital Course With Cerebrospinal Fluid White Blood Cells and Protein, and Attempted Treatments\n\nX-axis represents hospital day, and Y-axis represents WBC in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

Findings on the MRI of the head and T-spine continued to improve (Figure 2, D and E). Inflammation in CSF peaked on day 14 with 660/mm3 lymphocytes, with 5 oligoclonal bands, and IgG synthesis rate of 21.22. The patient underwent 3 sessions of plasma exchange. On day 24, the autoimmune encephalitis CSF panel came back positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody, and a diagnosis of GFAP antibody-associated meningoencephalomyelitis was made. Anti-NMDA receptor antibody was negative. IV immunoglobulins were given, followed by cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2. Whole-body CT, PET-CT, and scrotal ultrasound were negative for malignancy. Despite the improvement in CSF and MRI findings, the patient continued to have severe myoclonus, requiring continuous sedation and 3 antiseizure drugs; EEG developed bifrontal epileptic discharges while on these medications. The patient was palliatively extubated and died on day 47. His family agreed to proceed with an autopsy.\n\nAutopsy Findings\n\nThe autopsy revealed acute pneumonia and undiagnosed well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (WDNET) in the small intestine; this was negative for GFAP immunohistochemistry. Gross examination of the brain demonstrated diffuse mild leptomeningeal fibrosis over the convexities with scattered arachnoid granulations. Sectioning revealed severe edema of the cerebral hemispheres with enlarged gyri, narrow sulci, and central herniation affecting the midbrain. A thorough microscopic examination revealed variable degrees of inflammation involving the entire brain except for the cerebellum. The inflammatory infiltrates were perivascular with extension into the parenchyma (Figure 3A). There was no evidence of demyelination or loss of GFAP stain, nor fragmented or macrophage-engulfed astrocytes; GFAP stain showed focal moderate cortical gliosis and some subpial gliosis. Aquaporin 4 (AQP-4) stain was not performed. There was no vasculitis or necrosis. The inflammatory cells were a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages (Figure 3, B and C). No B lymphocytes or plasma cells were identified. CD68 immunostain showed prominent microglial activation and macrophages throughout the cortex and white matter, as well as highlighting perivascular and leptomeningeal infiltrates (Figure 3D). There were diffuse severe acute hypoxic-ischemic leukoencephalopathy and severe edema throughout the cortices. There were no Lewy bodies, inclusions, senile plaques, or neurofibrillary tangles as demonstrated by \u03b1-synuclein, \u03b2-amyloid, and Tau immunostains. The spinal cord was not examined.\n\nFigure 3 Neuropathologic Finding on Autopsy\n\nSections are from hippocampus.

Autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy defined by GFAP IgG positivity in the CSF is an emerging disease entity first described in 2016 as angiography-negative, corticosteroid-responsive subacute meningoencephalomyelitis with CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis.1,2 Neuropathologic evaluation of the condition is limited to brain and meningeal biopsies of 5 patients to date, as summarized in Table 1.3-5 One case series from China showed astrocytopathy with a loss or decrease of GFAP and AQP-4 stain with GFAP antibody in CSF, notably with concurrent autoantibodies such as p-ANCA, antiendothelial cell, anti-MOG, antinuclear, anti-SSA, and anti-Ro-52 antibodies in 3 of 4 cases.3 In our case, AQP-4 immunostaining or antemortem serum testing was not performed; however, there was no signs of astrocyte involvement with GFAP immunostaining, including loss or decrease of GFAP, fragmentation, or phagocytosis of the astrocytes. Our case goes against the causal pathogenicity to astrocyte decay of the GFAP antibody in CSF, in contrast to the well-documented pathogenicity of AQP-4 antibody in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders resulting in astrocytopathy.6-9\n\nTable 1 Pathologic Findings of GFAP Antibody Associated Autoimmune Encephalitis\n\nThe neuropathologic finding of our case was relatively nonspecific. Differential diagnoses of the neuropathologic findings include chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS) and anti-NMDA encephalitis. In CLIPPERS, the mainstay of inflammatory cells is CD4 T-cells, indicating possible major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted antigen presentation or allergic reaction, along with microglia, histiocytes, and B cells. Vascular damage with necrosis, fibrin deposition astrocytic fragmentation, neuronophagia, and focal demyelination have been seen.10 Our case with inflammation in gray and white matter of whole brain contradicts CLIPPERS, which has the predilection to the white matter of the hindbrain. As for NMDA encephalitis, the hallmark of pathology is perivascular B-cell cuffing and scattered T cells in the parenchyma, which were not seen in our autopsy. Our case possibly was paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis with the GFAP-negative WDNET; this could infer that the GFAP antibody in the CSF was a byproduct of the ongoing inflammation, and rather not a causative cross-reacting autoantibody induced by the concurrent neoplasm.\n\nPeriventricular perivascular enhancement is perceived as a classic finding of autoimmune astrocytopathy seen in half of cases; however, it is unknown if this directly indicates astrocyte involvement.2,3,11 In our case, the perivascular enhancement in the midbrain and basal ganglia on MRI did not correlate with astrocyte involvement in the autopsy. Collectively, because positive GFAP antibody in CSF or periventricular perivascular enhancement on MRI does not confirm astrocytes involvement in the inflammation, the term \u201castrocytopathy\u201d should be used carefully until the pathologic demonstration. Nevertheless, we believe that identifying associated autoantibodies would help to guide care of otherwise indistinguishable autoimmune encephalitides, possibly augmenting cancer screening in select cases. Further accumulation of cases is needed to better define this emerging disease entity.\n\nWe have important limitations in our report. First, this was a postmortem study after a prolonged disease course, and the cardiopulmonary compromise shortly before death likely affected the pathology with hypoxic-ischemic changes. The extensive immunotherapies also likely altered the pathology findings, evidenced by antemortem oligoclonal bands in the CSF without postmortem B and plasma cells.

She had previously undergone live directed donor renal transplantation 13 years prior. As the 10 year survival of living transplant recipients increases, malignancy presentations will continue to rise. Nephron sparing surgery in renal allografts is sparse due to difficult operative dissection and complicated hila vascular control. We present the use of manual atraumatic graded bowel clamp pressure around the resected tumour as a viable option to safely perform partial nephrectomy in a transplanted kidney.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\nTransplant recipients are twice as likely to develop a malignancy compared to the rest of the population. However, the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in this population is only mildly elevated at 4.6% compared with 3% in the general population. Only 10% of these tumours occur in the allograft. End stage kidney disease and chronic immunosuppression is known to pre-dispose native kidneys to malignancy. However, the aetiology of malignancy in allografts is poorly understood with no consensus on treatment.1\n\nHistorically, radical nephrectomy (RN) was considered first line treatment due to the potential for rapidly progressive RCC in an immunosuppressed patient. This placed patients back on dialysis with associated mortality and morbidity. Nephron sparing surgical (NSS) approaches are considered risky due to the hostile operative environment. However, sparse case report data indicate technical feasibility.2 We present a novel technique to perform off clamp NSS in a transplant recipient presenting with two tumours in an allograft kidney.\n\nCase report\nA 61-year-old women presented with an incidental anterior mid pole renal mass on ultrasound. She had previously undergone live directed donor renal transplantation 13 years prior into the right iliac fossa. This was uncomplicated and her serum creatinine post-transplant ranged between 95 and 110\u03bcmol/L. Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy included tacrolimus, mycophenolate and low dose prednisolone (3mg daily). Her background included steroid induced insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and osteopenia. She was independent with all activities of daily living.\n\nA computed tomography (CT) scan identified two enhancing renal lesions which were partly exophytic with some cystic components. The larger 3cm lesion was located in the anterior mid-pole region and the smaller 1.5cm lesion was located in the anterior upper pole region of the transplanted kidney (Fig. 1). No metastatic spread was found on staging. An open dual partial nephrectomy of the allograft kidney was planned.Fig. 1 Pre-operative planning CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. A \u2013 sagittal view showing an enhancing, complex anterior mid-pole 3cm allograft lesion (green arrow). B \u2013 sagittal view showing cystic components of the allograft lesion (blue arrow).

D \u2013 axial view showing an enhancing, complex anterior mid-pole 3cm allograft lesion (green arrow). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)\n\nFig. 1\n\nThe patient was positioned supine and a 10cm incision was made through the previous Gibson incision. Dissection to the renal parenchyma was performed exposing the anterior and upper pole of the kidney. Intraoperative ultrasonography was used to identify both tumours (Fig. 2). Dissection of the hilum was not performed due to adhesions, short hilar vessels and to limit trauma to the transplanted vessels. Dual partial nephrectomy using cold cut and diathermy achieved excision of both tumours. A curved bowel clamp was utilised to apply local graded manual pressure directly underneath the tumour site during the resection of the tumour and subsequent renorrhaphy closure to minimise haemorrhage (Fig. 3A/B). A 2-0 V-loc suture was used for renorrhaphy closure. There was approximately 500mL of blood loss. The post-operative course was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged day 6 with a serum creatinine of 111\u03bcmol/L. The histopathology revealed Grade 3 clear cell RCC with negative margins at both sites and at one month follow up the patient remained well (Fig. 3C/D). The maintenance immunosuppressants were not altered before or after surgery.Fig. 2 Dissection to the allograft kidney.

According to the 2018 Australian and New Zealand Scientific Registry of Transplant Patients, the 10 year survival for living transplant recipients has increased from 84% to 88% compared to the previous decade. This will likely see increasing presentations of malignancy within the allograft. Although the aetiology for RCC in allografts is not completely understood, theories exist within the literature. A recent study from Germany examined 1655 transplant patients for approximately 12 years.3 Twenty-six cases of RCC after transplantation were diagnosed. Post-transplant RCC was significantly associated with longer durations of pre-transplant haemodialysis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), post-transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) and/or mycophenolate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020) and with post-transplant prednisolone (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042). Cyclosporine A and mycophenolate usage were also independent risk factors for RCC development. The patient in our study had been on mycophenolate and prednisolone for over 10 years.\n\nThe literature on nephron sparing surgery in renal allografts is sparse and mostly limited to patients with T1a allograft masses.2 Traditionally all other masses are managed with full RN of the allograft kidney. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) randomised trial 30904 is the only multi-centre international randomised control trial which compared NSS and RN in 541 non-transplant patients with small (\u22645 cm) singular renal tumours.4 NSS was shown to reduce post-operative moderate renal dysfunction (eGFR <60) by 21% (95% CI, 13.8\u201328.3) when compared with RN with no difference in cancer-specific survival or oncological clearance. Re-operation rates in NSS was slightly higher compared to RN (4.4% compared with 2.4%) with bleeding accounting for 71% of surgical take-back. Although this study was completed in native kidney disease, results suggest NSS is a viable alternative.\n\nPartial nephrectomy of the renal allograft is a challenging procedure due to adhesions. Severe adhesions make kidney mobilisation, hilum control and parenchymal resection difficult. We present the use of manual atraumatic graded bowel clamp pressure around the resected tumour as an alternative to hilum vascular control. As shown in Fig. 3A/B close proximal clamping of the parenchyma surrounding the tumour during resection provides tamponade pressure and allows safe resection of the tumour until haemostatic sutures and/or cautery can be attended. This eliminates the need to dissect out the renal hilum of the allograft and provides zero global ischemia to maximise nephron sparing.\n\nImmunosuppressive adjustment reduces allograft malignancy without compromising rejection. The CONVERT trial randomised 830 renal allograft recipients 6\u2013120 months post-transplant to remain on calcineurin inhibitiors (CNI) or convert CNI to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.5 Conversion to an mTOR inhibitior was associated with a lower incidence of all malignancy (12% compared with 21% p=<0.001) with no significant difference in biopsy confirmed acute rejection. The patient in our case would therefore benefit from conversion of CNI to mTOR inhibitor.\n\nConclusion\nPartial nephrectomy is a safe and viable option to consider in the management of small renal masses in the transplanted kidney. The use of manual atraumatic graded bowel clamp pressure around the resected tumour is an alternative to hilum vascular control and can facilitate safe effective resection.\n\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for profit sectors.\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\nNil.\n\nAcknowledgements\nNil.",

The presence of haematological malignancies are expected to increase the risk of adverse outcomes from this viral infection due to the immunosuppression brought about by the underlying cancer and the effects of therapy. We present a 55-year-old woman diagnosed with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) who had been heavily pretreated with multiagent chemotherapy, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHCT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) and was complicated with EBV associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). The patient was recently treated with brentuximab and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for relapse after alloHCT. She suffered from severe COVID-19 pneumonia and eventually succumbed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. Of note, this is the first reported case of COVID-19 in a HL patient who was being treated with brentuximab for relapse after alloHCT.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China (1). This novel coronavirus was named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many studies have identified cancer as a comorbidity in COVID-19 patients. The study by Liang et al., which included 1,590 COVID-19 cases, demonstrated that the likelihood of COVID-19 infection was higher in cancer patients compared to the normal population (2). In addition, among cancer patients, the incidence of the need for intensive level care, mechanical ventilation and potential deaths are higher compared to non-cancer patients (2). Immunocompromised patients with hematologic cancers have been historically more susceptible to viral respiratory diseases. That risk is currently more apparent given the increased virulence of the severe SARS-CoV-2 (3, 4). One multicenter study including 105 patients with cancer showed that cancer patients are at higher risk for COVID-19 and encounter a higher frequency of severe events. Moreover, patients with hematologic malignancies such as lymphoma were noted to have relatively higher rates of death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (5). Herein, we describe a patient with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL), who suffered from severe COVID-19 pneumonia and eventually died because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of COVID-19 in a HL patient who was being treated with brentuximab for relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT).\n\nCase Presentation\n\nIn April 2020, a 55-year-old female with a medical history of classical HL diagnosed on February 2011 was diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient\u2019s treatment history for HL included ABVD (doxorubicin,\u00a0bleomycin,\u00a0vinblastine, dacarbazine) at initial diagnosis (February 2011), IVE (ifosfamide, epirubicin, etoposide) as salvage chemotherapy for refractory disease (January 2012) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHCT) with BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) as the conditioning regimen in September 2012. Nivolumab was administered for relapse after autoHCT (April 2016). She developed papillary thyroid cancer in January 2017 and was cured by thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment. As salvage chemotherapy, the patient also received brentuximab + bendamustine (February 2017) and GDP (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin) (May 2017). Partial remission (PR) was achieved and in March 2018, alloHCT was performed from HLA-matched sibling donor with Fludarabine + melphelan as the conditioning regimen. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood and GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine combined with methotrexate. In August 2018, severe chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) with skin and liver involvement developed. Complete remission (CR) of chronic GVHD was achieved with steroid, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate. In November 2018, she was diagnosed with EBV associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV associated PTLD) and CR was obtained after eight doses of weekly rituximab. Intravenous immunoglobulin\u00a0(IVIG) 400 mg/kg/day per 3 weeks was started for acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. In November 2019, the patient developed EBV viremia and was treated with rituximab, valganciclovir and foscarnet. In January 2020, relapse of HL was diagnosed with concurrent appearance of EBV viremia (EBV DNA load 34,694 copies/ml). Brentuximab 1.8 mg/kg and DLI (CD3:5 \u00d7 106/kg) every 3 weeks was initiated. He completed three cycles of brentuximab and DLI on March 2020. After three cycles, EBV DNA load decreased to 788 copies/ml and PR was obtained. In April 2020, she presented with shortness of breath and fever. She reported a five-day history of cough. On physical examination, she was pale, her body temperature was 38.3\u00b0C and she had hypoxia, with oxygen saturation as low as 88% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed fine bibasilar crackles. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed patchy peripheral bibasilar ground glass opacities in both lungs, findings compatible with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure 1). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab. Favipravir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were initiated. IVIG 400 mg/kg was administered. Her complete blood count (CBC) at admission showed the following: Hgb 10 g/dl, Htc 32%, total leukocyte count 4,320/mm3, neutrophil 520/mm3, lymphocyte 2,940/mm3 and platelet count 97,000/mm3. Prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time were normal. Serum ferritin level was 164 ug/L (23\u2013336). Fibrinogen level was 548 mg/dl (normal range, 200 to 400) and D-Dimer was elevated (1.72 \u03bcg/ml; normal range, 0 to 0.5). Low-molecular-weight heparin\u00a0(LMWH) was started. On biochemical tests, the following were abnormal: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 554 U/L (135\u2013248), albumin 2.4 g/dl (3.4\u20134.5), pro-BNP 2,050 ng/L (70\u2013133). ESR was elevated (48 mm/h; normal range, 2 to 20). C-reactive protein was elevated at 12.6 mg/L (normal range, 0\u20135) with normal procalcitonin level (0.13 ng/ml; normal range <0.5). During follow-up, she had worsening lymphopenia and her pro-BNP continued to increase. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and required invasive mechanical ventilation. Her chest X-ray revealed widespread bilateral alveolo-interstitial infiltrates (Figure 2). The patient succumbed to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on the 6th day of admission to the ICU 10 days after initial admission to the hospital.\n\nFigure 1 Chest computed tomography (CT) showed patchy peripheral bibasilar ground glass opacities in both lungs.\n\nFigure 2 Chest X-ray revealed widespread bilateral alveolo-interstitial infiltrates.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that immunocompromised patients including those who underwent cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, with a history of smoking or prolonged use of corticosteroids have the highest risk for severe COVID-19 (6). In line with the report of CDC, other reports also support that cancer patients are at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, compared to the public (2). Yet, there is no clear recommendation for cancer patients to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic which makes it a challenge for oncology and hematology practice.\n\nAbid et al. summarized recommendations for patients who develop COVID-19 while receiving coventional immunotherapy or immune-engaging therapies (7). They suggested that not critically sick COVID-19 patients should have their conventional immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) postponed until complete resolution of infection or wait for at least 2 weeks and immunosuppressive therapy should be considered in addition to immediate cessation of ICI in critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving ICI therapy (7). Similarly, once a patient completely recovers from COVID-19 and remains well for at least 2 weeks after recovery, the patient may be considered eligible to undergo further immune-engaging therapies including CAR T-cell therapy (7). There are few reports of HL cases with COVID-19 infection (8\u201311). O\u2019Kelly et al. described COVID-19 infection in a refractory HL patient being treated with pembrolizumab (8). Simand et al. reported a HL patient incidentally diagnosed with COVID-19 when reavulated with positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET/CT) after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy (9). Amin et al. reported an asymptomatic HL diagnosed with COVID-19 infection during routine staging for HL using PET/CT staging (10). Boulvard Chollet et al. reported an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection diagnosed during initial staging of a HL patient (11). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the outcome of a relapsed HL patient after alloHCT, who was being treated brentuximab and subsequently develops COVID-19.\n\nIn COVID-19 patients, T-cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 show good correlation with IgG and IgA antibody titers. This has important implication for long-term immune response (12\u201314). Total lymphocytes, especially CD8+ T cells are the main inflammatory cells and play an important role in virus clearance (15). Multivariate analysis showed that post-treatment decrease in CD8+ T cells and B cells were reported as independent predictors of poor treatment outcome in COVID-19 patients (15). It has been demostrated that CD8+ T cells tendfonc.2021.601709 to be an independent predictor for COVID-19 severity and treatment efficacy (16). In our patient, lymphopenia deepened during follow-up and the patient did not respond to treatment.\n\nCD30 is expressed in the medullary of the thymus gland on a subset of activated T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) and B cells (17). A soluble form of CD30 has been found to be elevated in the serum of patients with HL. CD30 blockade compromises the CD4+ T-cell mediated immune system (18). A recent report suggested that brentuximab with/without DLI is an effective salvage therapy for relapse of HL after alloHCT irrespective of pretransplant use of brentuximab (19). We described an HL patient who relapsed after alloHCT and in whom PR was achieved after three cycles of brentuximab and DLI. Cancer and its treatment can compromise the ability of the cancer patients to contain COVID-19 infection. In immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 infection, the likelihood of lethality is higher (20, 21).\n\nStudies support that lymphopenia is a specific risk factor for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 (15). This had led some experts to recommend critical re-evaluation of the need for drugs that inhibit B cells, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, during the pandemic (22). There is no clear recommendation about the use of brentuximab during the COVID-19 pandemic. Brentuximab has activity on T-lymphocytes and in a phase I/II study, common adverse events of brentuximab reported included lymphopenia in 80%, neutropenia in 65% and leukopenia in 65% of patients (23). Infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in brentuximab treated patients (23). It is recommended to closely monitor patients during brentuximab for bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. In our index case, we think that history offonc.2021.601709 alloHCT, acquired immune deficiency and recent use offonc.2021.601709 brentuximab, led to ARDS and fatal outcome during COVID-19 infection.\n\nTransplant recipients make up a special population of cancer patients, in whom more specialized and tailored attention and care are warranted. There is sufficient concern that COVID-19 could have a significant impact on post-transplant outcomes. A large recent observational cohort study of Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)\u00a0reported a higher risk of mortality among HCT recipients with COVID-19 infection (24). According to the aforementioned study, at 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19, overall survival was 68% for recipients of alloHCT and 67% for recipients of autoHCT (24). To date, no ideal marker has been identified to predict the clinical course or outcome of COVID-19 in alloHCT patients. To conclude, our patient is a heavily pretreated patient with relapsed/refractory HL with history of autoHCT, chemo-immunotherapy, alloHCT, EBV associated PTLD, chronic GVHD and immunosuppressive therapy. Abid MA. reported that a sustained immune response occurs in response to viral infections comprising of B-cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells (25).\u00a0In our index case, aforementioned factors which result in immunosupression and the recent use of brentuximab which causes lymphopenia and compromises the CD4 T-cell mediated immune system resulted in severe disease including pneumonia and ARDS related to COVID-19 infection. The prevention and protection measures to minimize the probability of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 are very important especially in highly immunosupressive patients. As a whole, cancer is an immunocompromised state, and many cancer treatments can further compromise the immune system. This isfonc.2021.601709 the first report of COVID-19 infection in a HL patient, whofonc.2021.601709 wasfonc.2021.601709 being treated with brentuximab for relapse after alloHCT.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM Ab) and myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) were positive, and the anti-GBM Ab titer being extremely high. She was treated with hemodialysis, plasma exchange and prednisolone. She survived the illness; however, neither the fetus nor her kidney function could be rescued. She had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*1502:01, which differs from the DRB1*1501 associated with anti-GBM GN. When patients have particular symptoms, we should check the urine and serum creatinine to exclude RPGN, even in cases of pregnancy.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nAnti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM GN), also called Goodpasture's syndrome, is an autoimmune-mediated disorder, and patients with anti-GBM antibody disease develop rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), leading to severe kidney deterioration. Despite various aggressive treatments, the prognosis of anti-GBM GN is very poor, often leading to renal failure and/or death (1). Once anti-GBM GN patients begin dialysis, they usually remain dialysis-dependent (2). Anti-GBM GN is well known to occur in young and elderly patients (3) and is a rare cause of renal insufficiency in young patients, especially in association with pregnancy.\n\nWe herein report a case of anti-GBM GN disease requiring dialysis that presented in early pregnancy.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 28-year-old woman was introduced to our hospital because of generalized edema associated with a reduced urine output in the eighth week of pregnancy. She had no abnormality recorded in her previous medical examinations. This was her first pregnancy, and she had had no miscarriages. At a medical examination one year earlier, her serum creatinine level had been 0.64 mg/dL, and urine protein and urine occult blood were negative. There was no familial history of renal disease. She had had gross hematuria, a fever, nausea and diarrhea for about three weeks. She visited a local obstetrics clinic and was treated with amoxicillin for a suspected urinary tract infection. Treatment with antibiotics did not improve her symptoms, and she was referred urgently to our hospital because of severe kidney dysfunction.\n\nOn a clinical examination, she had bilateral pitting pedal edema, abdominal fullness, due to ascites fluid, and anemia. Her blood pressure was 134/81 mmHg, her pulse rate was 89/minute and her body temperature was 37.7\u2103. She had no hemosputum or hypoxemia, and the remainder of her systemic examination findings, including those for her chest, were within normal limits.\n\nThe laboratory findings on admission are shown in Table 1. She had severe renal dysfunction with urinary abnormality, severe inflammation, anemia, hypoproteinemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and hyperuricemia. Anti-GBM Ab and myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) were positive, with the anti-GBM Ab titer (>680 U/mL) being extremely high, unlike the MPO-ANCA titer (16.1 U/mL). Both anti-nuclear Ab (ANA) and PR3-ANCA were negative. There was no reduction in the complement value and no monoclonal protein. Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen showed her right kidney to be 10.5 cm \u00d74.0 cm and left kidney to be 10.6 cm \u00d74.3 cm, with bilateral increased echogenicity. Chest X-ray showed no interstitial pneumonia or alveolar hemorrhaging, which are typically seen in Goodpasture's syndrome. The values of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), Surfactant Protein A (SP-A) Surfactant Protein D (SP-D) were within normal limits.\n\nTable 1.

In an effort to rescue her fetus and her kidney function, she was treated with hemodialysis and plasma exchange (PE) and started on 30 mg/day of prednisolone. Her clinical course is shown in Fig. 1. On admission, obstetric ultrasound findings showed five weeks of gestation, which differed from the estimated 8 weeks of gestation from her last menstruation, and miscarriage was strongly suspected. After reconfirmation, a fetal heartbeat could not be detected, so dilatation and curettage were performed on the 15th day of admission. All of our efforts were then directed to saving her kidneys and life.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical course of the patient.\n\nShe was examined by a renal biopsy on the 24th day of admission. The biopsy revealed 27 glomeruli, of which 1 had segmental necrosis with nuclear debris and hyaline thrombi within glomerular capillaries. There were fibrocellular crescents in 26 glomeruli. The underlying tufts did not show significant endocapillary proliferation. Lymphocyte infiltration around the tubulointerstitium was found near the glomerulus (Fig. 2A) and mainly formed fibrocellular crescents (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence staining revealed linear IgG (Fig. 2C) and C3 staining along glomerular capillary loops. IgA, IgM and C1q were negative, and fibrinogen was weakly positive. A diagnosis of crescentic glomerulonephritis was made, which was consistent with anti-GBM GN disease with diffuse global glomerulosclerosis. Based on the kidney biopsy result, we suspected a low probability of improving her renal function. Although plasma exchange was performed 14 times and immunosuppressive therapy continued, anuria persisted, and her kidney function did not improve; she could not discontinue hemodialysis despite a reduction in the anti-GBM Ab titer (42.3 U/mL) and C-reactive protein (CRP) on the 71st hospital day. On that day, her serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 55.1 mg/dL and creatinine 11.6 mg/dL (Fig. 1). The high titer level of anti-GBM Ab persisted, and no improvement in the kidney function could be expected, but fortunately, there were no signs of respiratory symptoms or the development of lung lesions, which was important in deciding to withdraw treatment. Her life was saved; however, give the loss of her renal function, renal transplantation in the near future is desirable.\n\nFigure 2. Histological findings in the kidney.

We summarized the reports of anti-GBM GN in pregnancy in Table 2 (5-13). There have been some reports of a severe renal outcome and prognosis in pregnancy (5-7,9). For example, Qin et al. reported both maternal and fetal death in a case of Goodpasture's syndrome during pregnancy (5).\n\nTable 2.

Vasiliou et al. described a 34-year-old woman who presented with RPGN with anti-GBM GN at 18 weeks of pregnancy, and her baby was born alive after 27 weeks of gestation (10). She was treated with acute dialysis for renal failure and received intensive treatment with PE, corticosteroid and azathioprine, resulting in the partial recovery of her kidney function. A renal biopsy showed 80% crescentic GN with linear immune fluorescence. Yankowitz et al. reported the case of a 28-year-old woman with anti-GBM GN 3 months before pregnancy who was treated with intensive hemodialysis along with corticosteroid and delivered at 37 weeks of gestation (11). Anti-GBM Ab, which had been negative during pregnancy, was detected again after delivery. Sprenger-M\u00e4hr et al. described the case of a 30-year-old woman with anti-GBM GN and who was treated with PE, corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide and rituximab and delivered at 38 weeks of gestation (12). Although the differences between the reports with good and poor renal prognoses are unclear, it seems that anti-GBM GN requires aggressive treatment, even during pregnancy. In our case, the anti-GBM antibody titers were very high, even during pregnancy, and did not become negative after treatment. She also obtained a very poor renal recovery with immunosuppression, along with intensive plasma exchange and hemodialysis.\n\nThe outcomes of the infants of mothers with anti-GBM GN during pregnancy are generally poor, often resulting in stillbirth and both natural and artificial abortion (7,8,13). Nilssen et al. reported a 19-year-old woman who was treated with RPGN with anti-GBM GN in the second trimester of pregnancy and had a stillbirth at 28 weeks of gestation (7). Nair et al. described the case of a 23-year-old woman who presented with Goodpasture's syndrome during the 13th week of pregnancy (8). She was started on corticosteroid and cytotoxic agents, along with intensive PE and alternate day hemodialysis. Her pregnancy was terminated at 15 weeks. The patient improved dramatically with treatment, her renal function normalized, and her anti-GBM Ab became undetectable. However, some reports have described successful deliveries of live infants, despite poor kidney outcomes. Al-Harbi et al. reported a 30-year-old woman with acute kidney injury at 28 weeks of gestation who was treated with intensive hemodialysis along with corticosteroid (9). The patient did not recover bad kidney function and required regular maintenance hemodialysis, but she delivered at 34 weeks of gestation. In summary, pregnant women complicated with anti-GBM GN are unlikely but still able to deliver a newborn baby, although many such infants have low birth weights.\n\nThe titers of anti-GBM Ab decline in response to immunosuppression and plasma exchange. Plasma exchange is generally considered low risk in pregnancy (14). Anti-GBM Ab binds human placental antigens (15); however, the clinical outcome of this phenomenon is controversial (4). Deubner et al. discussed a protective aspect of the placental binding of anti-GBM antibodies, resulting in decreased transfer to the fetus and reduced maternal total anti-GBM Ab levels (6). However, anti-GBM Ab binding to the placenta might increase the risk of placental dysfunction if not treated aggressively. Anti-GBM Ab comprises IgG antibodies and is transported across the placenta via placental transporters. There is the possibility that the fetus may be exposed to maternal IgG antibodies, including anti-GBM antibodies. In the present patient, no placenta was observed in the uterine contents, and anti-IgG staining of the uterine contents was not apparent.\n\nWe investigated the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes through an external examination center (LSI Medience Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). HLA-DRB1*1501 is known to have a strong relationship with anti-GBM GN pathogenesis (16-18). HLA-DR15 confers a markedly increased disease risk; an autoreactive CD4+ T-cell self-epitope, derived from the \u03b13 chain of type IV collagen, is expanded in patients with Goodpasture syndrome (19). The present patient had HLA-DRB1*1502:01, which was not consistent with the previous report. The only difference between DRB1*1501 and DRB1*1502 is the 86th amino acid in pocket 4; here, a valine residue in HLA-DRB1*1501 is substituted by a glycine residue in DRB1*1502 (17). However, the relationship between HLA-DRB1*1502:01 and the pathogenesis of the anti-GBM GN in this case was not clear.\n\nWe need to consider the relationship between pregnancy and renal failure. First, we discuss the relationship with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) (20). Because this case had <20 weeks of gestation, it did not meet the definitions of pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension or superimposed pre-eclampsia. In addition, the findings of a renal biopsy did not reveal endothelial injury, which is typical of HDP (21,22). While anti-GBM GN may have been exacerbated by pregnancy or developed during pregnancy, the anti-GBM Ab before pregnancy had not been measured, so we could not determine the pathogenesis of this disease.\n\nUnfortunately, the patient's kidney function did not recover, and her fetus was stillborn. We consider it necessary to pay attention to the subjective symptoms of anti-GBM GN, which include a fever, macrohematuria, general fatigue and systemic edema, in the early stage of the disease. In particular, such a serious disease might exist in a pregnant woman who is diagnosed as a urinary tract infection. We should not ignore the possibility of RPGN and should check the urine and serum creatinine contents to avoid a misdiagnosis. We hope that this case report will improve awareness of a potential anti-GBM GN diagnosis and its appropriate treatment during pregnancy.\n\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient described in this case report.\n\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).\n\nFinancial Support\n\nThis study was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Intractable Renal Diseases Research, Research on rare and intractable diseases, Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan.",

We report a case of a young male with disease refractory to multiple lines of therapy, including chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, who achieved his first complete remission after haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (haplo-BMT), following donor leukocyte infusions (DLIs) given concurrently with blinatumomab. While DLI has been used after T-replete haplo-BMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide, there are no reports on its use for PMBCL. Similarly, blinatumomab is active against B-cell lymphomas, but literature is lacking in patients with PMBCL. Our experience illustrates that blinatumomab can be used concurrently with DLI in a haploidentical setting to achieve disease response in PMBCL. Despite our encouraging experience with this case, we would not recommend this approach outside of a clinical trial as blinatumomab may exacerbate the graft versus host disease risks of DLI, especially in a haploidentical setting. Evaluating this treatment combination in high-risk patients in the setting of a clinical trial may be meaningful.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nPrimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a rare hematologic malignancy representing only 2\u20133% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs).1 It has distinct clinical and immunopathological features intermediate to diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) and Hodgkin lymphomas. It tends to occur in younger patients and is characterized by bulky, locally invasive disease that can infiltrate the lungs, pleura, chest wall and pericardium, often compromising the airway and venous blood flow. While prognosis is generally favorable, especially for younger individuals, those who relapse have a dramatically lower chance of survival. Autologous and, less frequently, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations (HCTs) have been used for patients with relapsed/refractory disease with mixed results.2 We report a case of a young adult male with disease refractory to multiple lines of therapy, including chimeric antigen receptor-T cells (CAR-T cells), who achieved his first complete remission after haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT), following donor leukocyte infusions (DLIs) given concurrently with blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody.\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 21-year-old male presented with left cervical swelling and pain over his clavicle. A computed tomography (CT) of his chest and abdomen was obtained, showing a large anterior mediastinal mass. Pathologic and immunohistochemical examination showed fibrotic tissue with nests of large CD19+, CD20+, CD23+, CD30+, CD45+, CD3\u2013, CD5\u2013, CD10\u2013, CD15\u2013, BCL6+, MUM1+, PAX5+, B-cells with loss of surface immunoglobulin expression and high expression of PD-L1 and a Ki-67 proliferative index of 90%, confirming the diagnosis of PMBCL, non-germinal center type. The cells were negative for rearrangement of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization.\n\nUpon diagnosis, he received six cycles of dose adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R).3 An end of treatment positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan demonstrated refractory disease, necessitating involved field irradiation. A follow-up PET-CT scan revealed extension of disease below the diaphragm [Figure 1(a)]. The patient then received salvage chemotherapy of ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide and rituximab, but his disease progressed. A cycle of rituximab, gemcitabine, navelbine and doxorubicin was given for debulking and pembrolizumab was initiated with an early response [Figure 1(b)]. However, his disease again demonstrated progression following eight cycles of pembrolizumab [Figure 1(c)]. A repeat biopsy demonstrated expression of CD30 in a diffuse and strong membranous fashion, leading to treatment with brentuximab vedotin, resulting in a partial response (PR) [Figure 1(d)]. He then received an infusion of CAR-T cells (tisagenlecleucel), but his disease progressed [Figure 1(e)]. Subsequent treatments included bendamustine and brentuximab followed by gemcitabine, cisplatin and dexamethasone, again yielding a very good PR [Figure 1(f)].\n\nFigure 1. Responses to treatment before haploidentical bone marrow transplantation. Shown are positron emission tomography computed tomography images performed after each respective treatment (Post-Rx). Post-Dx mo. indicates months after initial diagnosis. (a) Extension of disease below the diaphragm following dose adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) and involved field irradiation (xRT); (b) interim response after receiving ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide and rituximab (ICE-R), then navelbine and doxorubicin (R-GND) followed by first dose of pembrolizumab (Pembro); (c) progression of disease after eight doses of pembrolizumab; (d) partial response after brentuximab vedotin; (e) failure to respond to anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy; (f) very good partial response after bendamustine and brentuximab followed by gemcitabine, cisplatin and dexamethasone (GCD).\n\nHaving completed nine failed radiochemoimmunotherapy regimens, he consented to a T-replete haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (haplo-BMT) with his brother as the donor. He was conditioned with a myeloablative regimen of busulfan, fludarabine and melphalan with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY).4\u20136 His post-BMT course was complicated by enterococcal bacteremia with meningitis on day +13, requiring 6\u2009weeks of intravenous antibiotics. He showed no clinical signs of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) despite maintaining low tacrolimus levels (4\u20136\u2009ng/ml) during the first month post-BMT. Early tacrolimus taper was started on day +33 with discontinuation on day +40. On day +44, a suprasternal chest wall mass emerged and a repeat biopsy on day +47 confirmed PMBCL. A PET-CT scan on day +49 demonstrated interval progression of disease [Figure 2(a)].\n\nFigure 2. Responses to treatment after haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (haplo-BMT). Shown are positron emission tomography computed tomography images performed after each respective treatment (Post-BMT). Post-Dx mo. indicates months after initial diagnosis. (a) Disease progression after haplo-BMT; (b) mixed response with decreased mediastinal and chest wall FDG avidity but new focal subpleural avid areas, new mildly avid pulmonary nodules and a new focal lesion in the hepatic dome during second cycle of blinatumomab (Blina) and following donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) but before progression to grade III graft-versus-host disease (GvHD); (c) sustained tumor response with intense FDG uptake throughout the small and large colon compatible with intestinal GvHD while on tapering doses of prednisone (PRED) and cyclosporine A (CSA) ; (d) complete metabolic response with less intestinal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake but evidence of esophangitis and gastritis after discontinuing immunosuppression; (e) disease recurrence after stopping blinatumomab and resolution of GvHD; (f) complete metabolic response.\n\nBlinatumomab infusion was initiated on day +50 at a dose of 10\u2009\u00b5g/m2 per day, escalated to 15\u2009\u00b5g/m2 per day on day +52. While on blinatumomab (day +54), the patient received a haploidentical DLI from the same donor at a dose of 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CD3+ cells/kg. His chest wall mass continued to expand with intensifying pain, so, 2\u2009weeks later, he was given a second DLI infusion consisting of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 CD3+ cells/kg (day +68). On day +78, the patient developed a stage I aGvHD skin rash, and, upon exam, his chest wall mass was noticeably smaller. aGvHD progressed to stage II skin on day +82 and he started topical steroids. A repeat PET-CT scan on day +85 showed a mixed response with decreased mediastinal and chest wall fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity but new focal subpleural avid areas, new mildly avid pulmonary nodules and a new focal lesion in the hepatic dome [Figure 2(b)]. On day +89, his aGvHD had progressed to stage III with vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss. Therefore, prednisone 2\u2009mg/kg and cyclosporine were started. He developed pancytopenia and hypoalbunemia. He was readmitted to the hospital on day +92, as he was not tolerating oral medications and had developed significant diarrhea (stage III) with overall grade III aGvHD. His stool was negative for c-difficile and for other gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens. With progression of GvHD his chest mass and lymphadenopathy decreased. A repeat PET-CT scan on day +113 confirmed a sustained tumor response and revealed intense FDG uptake throughout the small and large colon compatible with intestinal GvHD [Figure 2(c)]. After initial improvement of skin and GI aGvHD symptoms cyclosporine was decreased in order to optimize graft-versus-lymphoma (GvL) effects. Drug levels were kept subtherapeutic (mean of 50\u2009ng/ml) from day +110 until day +150, at which time it was discontinued. Likewise, prednisone was progressively tapered to 1\u2009mg/kg by day +120 and discontinued on day +160. The patient\u2019s pancytopenia and hypoalbunemia resolved. Moreover, no palpable masses or lymphadenopathy were appreciable by physical examination. A repeat PET-CT scan was performed on day +167, after four cycles of blinatumomab, which demostrated, for the first time since his diagnosis, a complete metabolic response of his PMBCL with less intestinal FDG uptake due to aGvHD [Figure 2(d)]. Skin GvHD worsened and prednisone was restarted at 20\u2009mg daily on day +197. On +218 the patient noted increasing lympadenopthy and repeat PET-CT confirmed extensive relapse of his PMBCL [Figure 2(e)]. An additional 4\u2009week course of blinatumomab was then given between days +219 and +246 at double the previous dose of 30\u2009\u00b5g/m2 per day but without evidence of clinical improvement as an enlarging chest wall mass and lymphadenopathy was evident. The patient was transferred to hospice care where all prescribed medications including prednisone were discontinued. A month later, as his overall condition was improving, he discharged himself from hospice while seeking care at another institution. A PET scan was done on day +293, which, remarkably, again demonstrated complete resolution of disease [Figure 2(f)]. He is now day +386 following his haplo-BMT with no evidence of disease recurrence. He is receiving prednisone and ruxolitinib for chronic GvHD with skin involvement, contractures, ocular manifestations and pulmonary involvement.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDA-EPOCH-R has been used frequently as front-line treatment of PMBCL, but, due to the rarity of the disease, there is no consensus on optimal consolidation or treatment for relapsed/refractory disease. Many of the agents our patient received have been used previously for relapsed/refractory PMBCL.3,7,8 A study from Italy evaluated pembrolizumab in 17 patients with relapsed/refractory PMBCL and found that two achieved a complete response (CR) and five a PR.9 The same investigator reported on the use of brentuximab in 15 patients with PMBCL and found that only two patients achieved a PR, as was the case with our patient.10 In contrast to our patient who failed to respond to anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy, there is a single recent report of a patient with PMBCL who achieved a CR.11 It is also important to note that Food and Drug Administration approval for tisagenlecleucel is for DLBCL and not PMBCL; however, it was decided to treat our patient due to lack of other promising options.\n\nAutologous HCT has traditionally been used as salvage therapy for NHL, although allogeneic HCTs have been utilized by some centers. Our patient did not undergo an autologous HCT as he did not have chemotherapy sensitive disease. A recent four-institution retrospective analysis reviewed the outcomes of 28 patients with relapsed/refractory PMBCL who received allogeneic HCT (54% matched sibling, 29% matched unrelated and 18% mismatched unrelated or cord blood).2 Eighty percent of patients were sensitive to pre-transplant therapy and 86% received reduced intensity conditioning. The 5-year progression-free and overall survivals were 34% and 45%, respectively. None of the patients received prior PD-1 blockade or CAR-T cells and none received haploidentical HCT. Our case, therefore, is unique in that our patient previously received PD-1 blockade, CAR-T cells followed by a haplo-BMT. Despite having been treated with a PD-1 inhibitor before his transplant, receiving myeloablative conditioning and having his tacrolimus levels purposefully maintained in the low therapeutic range and discontinued by day +40, the patient did not develop aGvHD. Recent studies have documented that PT-CY lowers the risk of GvHD in patients that have received checkpoint inhibitors.12\n\nDLI has been used after T-replete haplo-BMT with PT-CY against relapsed leukemia and NHL, but to our knowledge there are no reports employing DLI for PMBCL.13 Blinatumomab has shown activity against other B-cell lymphomas, but there are no published reports in patients with PMBCL.14 The most effective dose of blinatumomab for NHL is 4-fold higher (60\u2009\u00b5g/m2 per day) than what our patient received as his dose was restricted due to ongoing peripheral neuropathy and persistent headaches. There is a single case report on concomitant use of DLI with blinatumomab following a matched unrelated donor transplant for leukemia but no reports in haploidentical HCT.15 While our experience illustrates that blinatumomab can be used concurrently with DLI in a haploidentical setting, the relative contribution of DLI versus blinatumomab in achieving a metabolic CR was not clear. Our patient relapsed after discontinuing blinatumomab; however, he had also restarted prednisone because of worsening GvHD symptoms therefore GvL activity was likely suppressed. His chest wall mass and lymphadenopathy continued to increase even during the fifth cycle of blinatumomab, despite receiving a higher dose. One cannot rule out rule out CD19 antigen escape since a repeat biopsy was not performed. Abruptly discontinuing prednisone during hospice led to worsening of chronic GvHD while evidently inducing another remission.\n\nDespite our encouraging experience with this case, we would not recommend this strategy outside a clinical trial as blinatumomab may exacerbate the GvHD risks of DLI especially in a haploidentical setting. Formally studying this treatment combination in high-risk patients may be meaningful.\n\nWe most importantly would like to express gratitude to our patient for allowing us to report his case.

The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors influencing the onset of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in patients receiving antiresorptive treatment (ART) with DNO by comparing patients suffering from MRONJ and patients without MRONJ. Multiple variables were evaluated including the impact of a previous BP intake.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective single-center cohort study with patients receiving DNO was conducted. One-hundred twenty-eight patients were included and divided into three groups: I (control, n\u2009=\u200940) receiving DNO with absence of MRONJ; group II (Test 1, n\u2009=\u200946), receiving DNO with presence of MRONJ; and group III (Test 2, n\u2009=\u200942) sequentially receiving BP and DNO with presence of MRONJ. Patients' medical history, focusing on the identification of MRONJ risk factors, was collected and evaluated. Parameters were sex, age, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, underlying disease (cancer type, osteoporosis), internal diseases, additional chemo/hormonal therapy, oral inflammation, and trauma.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe following risk factors were identified to increase MRONJ onset significantly in patients treated with DNO: chemo/hormonal therapy (p\u2009=\u20090.02), DNO dosage (p\u2009<\u20090.01), breast cancer (p\u2009=\u20090.03), intake of corticosteroids (p\u2009=\u20090.04), hypertension (p\u2009=\u20090.02), diabetes mellitus (p\u2009=\u20090.04), periodontal disease (p\u2009=\u20090.03), apical ostitis (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and denture use (p\u2009=\u20090.02). A medication switch did not affect MRONJ development (p\u2009=\u20090.86).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMalignant diseases, additional chemotherapy, DNO dosage, and oral inflammations as well as diabetes mellitus and hypertension influence MRONJ onset in patients treated with DNO significantly.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients receiving ART with DNO featuring aforementioned risk factors have a higher risk of MRONJ onset. These patients need a sound and regular prophylaxis in order to prevent the onset of MRONJ under DNO treatment.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nMedication-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a rare but severe adverse side effect of an antiresorptive therapy (ART). Initially described as being associated with the intake of bisphosphonates (BP) [1, 2], it became obvious that other antiresorptive drugs such as denosumab (DNO) have also the risk of inducing MRONJ [3\u20135]. Increasing tumor incidences, longer patient survival, adjuvant antiresorptive therapy strategies, and rising numbers of first-line regimes for osteoporosis are turning MRONJ into a disease of increasing importance [6\u20138].\n\nInterestingly, both the pharmacological mechanisms and pharmacokinetics of BP and DNO are markedly different: BP are admitted orally or intravenously and accumulate in bone by selectively binding to hydroxyapatite. In the soluble phase when released from bone in an acidic milieu, BP molecules interfere intracellularly in the mevalonate pathway and inactivate various cell types but in particular osteoclasts [9]. DNO, in contrast, is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the RANK ligand, a key cytokine for the differentiation, maturation, and activation of osteoclasts. Subcutaneously admitted DNO is inactivated by the immune system within weeks as other allogenic antibodies and does not accumulate in the body.\n\nBoth drugs have an osteoclast suppressing effect in common. Thus, conditions in which osteoclast activity is essentially needed (such as local bone inflammation processes of the jaws or bone remodeling after tooth extraction) may not be overcome and can lead to an osteonecrosis. While this pathogenesis theory is widely accepted [10\u201312] there are additional risk factors associated with MRONJ onset. Risk factors for BP therapy have previously been described in several studies (see Table 1). To date, however, only limited data with small sample sizes are available focusing on the impact of certain risk factors associated with DNO intake [13].Table 1 Availability of data concerning risk factors associated with MRONJ in patients treated with DNO compared to BP and sequentially with both drugs\n\n\tVariable\tDenosumab references\tDenosumab/bisphosphonate reference\tBisphosphonate references\t\nDemographic factors\tSex\t[13]\t[14]\t[15, 16]\t\nAge\t[13]\t*\t[15, 16]\t\nSmoking habit\t[13]\t*\t[15, 17\u201319]\t\nAlcohol consumption\t[13]\t*\t[15, 17\u201319]\t\nMedical comorbidities\tCancer type\t[13, 14]\t[14]\t[15, 16, 18\u201323]\t\nOsteoporosis\t[13, 14]\t[14]\t[15, 16, 18, 20, 24]\t\nDiabetes mellitus\t[13]\t[14]\t[15, 16, 18, 20, 25]\t\nDiseases of cardio-vascular system\t*\t*\t[16, 18]\t\nHypertension\t*\t[14]\t[16, 18, 21]\t\nRenal disease\t*\t*\t[16, 18]\t\nGastrointestinal disease\t*\t*\t[16, 18]\t\nThyroid malfunctions\t*\t[14]\t[16, 18]\t\nRheumatic diseases\t*\t[14]\t[16, 18, 22]\t\nInfectious diseases\t*\t*\t[16, 18, 22]\t\nCo-medication associated with underlying disease\tChemotherapy\t[13]\t[14]\t[1, 15, 22, 24, 26]\t\nMolecular targeted therapy\t[13]\t[14]\t[1, 15, 18\u201320, 22, 24, 26]\t\nCorticosteroid therapy\t[13]\t[14]\t[1, 18\u201320, 22, 24, 26]\t\nHormonal therapy\t[13]\t*\t[1, 15, 22, 24, 26]\t\nDental comorbidities\tExtraction\t[14]\t[14]\t[1, 15\u201325, 27\u201329]\t\nPeriodontal disease\t[13]\t[14]\t[15\u201318, 21, 27]\t\nApical ostitis\t[13]\t[14]\t[15, 17, 20, 23, 27, 30]\t\nRetained root\t*\t*\t[15, 17]\t\nDental cysts\t*\t*\t[15, 17, 30]\t\nDental implants\t[31]\t[14]\t[15\u201317, 23, 32\u201334]\t\nEndodontic treatment\t*\t*\t[35, 36]\t\nUse of dentures\t[13]\t[14]\t[15\u201318, 21, 27]\t\nTrauma\t*\t*\t[37, 38]\t\nPoor oral hygiene\t*\t[14]\t[15\u201318, 20, 21, 23, 27]\t\n*To our knowledge, few data (mostly case reports or studies with small cohorts) exist concerning these risk factors. Of note, the sample size of [13] was n\u2009=\u200914\n\nIdentification of risk factors could improve prophylaxis and prevention of MRONJ. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to find out other risk factors inducing the onset of MRONJ in patients receiving antiresorptive treatment with DNO.\n\nThe authors hypothesize that (I) certain demographic, co-medications, and oral-health factors influence the onset of MRONJ; (II) the switch from a previous BP intake to DNO intake furthermore influences the onset of MRONJ; and (III) that the presence of dental implants at the start of ART elevates the risk of MRONJ onset.\n\nThe specific aims of this study were to estimate (I) which factors, derived from patients medical history, influence MRONJ onset; (II) whether a combination of DNO/BP treatment elevates the risk of MRONJ onset; and (III) whether the presence of dental implants would impact MRONJ incidence.\n\nPatients and methods\n\nThis study was approved by the local medical association authority (Bayerische Landes\u00e4rztekammer, ethic committee number: 2020\u20131228) and was carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki 7th revision of 2013.\n\nStudy design\n\nWe designed and implemented a retrospective single-center cohort study and consecutively enrolled a sample derived from the source population of subjects who were treated at the Department \u201cMedicine and Aesthetics,\u201d Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Munich, between 2011 and 2020, and fulfilled a predefined selection protocol with the following inclusion criteria: (1) antiresorptive therapy (ART) with at least one or more doses of DNO in patients\u2019 medical history, (2) presence of MRONJ (for groups II and III) according to criteria for MRONJ according to the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (AAOMS) [39], (3) availability of panoramic dental X-ray, (4) follow-up examinations of at least 12\u00a0months, and (5) complete medical history including co-medication.\n\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) history of irradiation in the head and neck region, (2) metastatic bone disease of the maxillofacial region, (3) missing follow-up examinations, (4) missing panoramic dental X-ray, and (5) missing information in the medical history.\n\nAll patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were consecutively divided into three groups, according to patient\u2019s medical history: group I (control), DNO treatment and no presence of MRONJ; group II (Test 1, DNO), DNO treatment with presence of MRONJ; and group III (Test 2, DNO/BP), switch of ART from BP to DNO with presence of MRONJ (see Fig.\u00a01).Fig. 1 Flowchart of patient distribution into three groups\n\nStudy variables\n\nThe study variables were as follows: presence of MRONJ in patient\u2019s medical history (yes/no), demographic factors (age at last clinical examination, sex, duration of follow-up, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption), underlying disease requiring ART (cancer type and/or osteoporosis, bone metastasis, and time since initial diagnosis of underlying disease), ART type of medication (duration of medication and medication switch), co-medication associated with underlying disease (chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy, corticosteroid therapy, hormonal therapy, and antiangiogenic therapy), MRONJ (time since initial diagnosis of MRONJ, location, and surgical therapy), additional medical history (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, diseases of cardio-pulmonary system, thyroid malfunctions, rheumatic diseases, and infectious diseases), and intraoral findings (number of teeth, retained root, presence of dental implants prior to ART, periodontal disease, apical periodontitis, dental cysts, denture use, and presence of current dental procedure in area of MRONJ) (see Table 1).\n\nPrimary and follow-up examinations\n\nPatients not yet treated with DNO were referred to Medicine and Aesthetics by different regional oncologists and osteologists, prior to ART, for primary examination to assess oral health status. Patients\u2019 medical records on underlying disease, ART, medical comorbidities and co-medications, and oral findings were evaluated. Additionally, a panoramic X-ray was performed, and mucosal integrity and periodontal diseases were evaluated according to the European Federation of Periodontology guidelines [40].\n\nWith absence of MRONJ these patients underwent yearly (12\u00a0months) follow-up examinations undergoing the same examination. If required prophylactic treatment was performed according to the 2018 German MRONJ guidelines [41] and consisted of extraction of non-preservable and periodontally compromised teeth and dental implants, the excision of dental cysts and foreign bodies, and the reduction of denture-associated sore spots.\n\nPatients with onset of MRONJ were referred to Medicine and Aesthetics either by the same oncologists and osteologists or by their dentists initially discovering exposed bone or MRONJ lesions. Most patients presenting MRONJ received surgical treatment following the same therapeutic standardized protocol as recently described [42]. Follow-up examinations in cases of MRONJ were conducted quarterly (3\u00a0months). All examinations were conducted by the same investigators (CP, BHM, AW, PB). Surgery was performed by one and the same oral and maxillofacial surgery specialist (CP). When extraction of non-preservable or periodontally compromised teeth and dental implants was necessary under ongoing DNO therapy, procedures were again performed accordingly to the 2018 German MRONJ guidelines [41]. Treatment consisted essentially of minimally invasive techniques with consecutive smoothing of sharp bone edges, complete mucoperiostal closure, and perioperative antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125\u00a0mg 1\u20130-1, in case of allergy: clindamycin 600\u00a0mg 1\u20131-1, starting 1\u00a0week preoperatively and continuing for up to 3\u00a0weeks postoperatively) as well as a weekly follow-up in the first 4\u00a0weeks.\n\nThere was no recommendation for discontinuation of ART (drug holiday) by the investigators of this study, but in few cases (see Tables 1 and 2) ART was paused by the prescribing osteologists and/or oncologists at the time of first consultation in our clinic.Table 2 Patient characteristics and demographics\n\n\tVariables\tn (%) or median [range]\t\nDemographic factors\tMale\t49 (38.3%)\t\nFemale\t79 (61.7%)\t\nAge (years)\t72.2 [61.9\u201380.1]\t\nDuration of follow-up (months)\t14.0 [12.7\u201320.2]\t\nSmoking habit\t24 (18.8%)\t\nAlcohol consumption\t21 (16.4%)\t\nUnderlying disease\tOsteoporosis\t57 (44.5%)\t\nCancer\t86 (67.2%)\t\nBreast\t40 (31.3%)\t\nProstate\t31 (24.2%)\t\nOther\t15 (11.7%)\t\nBone metastasis\t86 (67.2%)\t\nTime since initial diagnosis of underlying disease (years)\t9.0 [6.0\u201314.3]\t\nAntiresorptive therapy\tDenosumab\t128 (100%)\t\n120\u00a0mg\t78 (60.9%)\t\n60\u00a0mg\t50 (39.1%)\t\nBisphosphonates\t42 (32.8%)\t\nZoledronate\t21 (16.4%)\t\nIbandronate\t14 (10.9%)\t\nOther\t7 (5.5%)\t\nDuration of medication (months)\t38.7 [22.9\u201359.2]\t\nCo-medication associated with underlying disease\tChemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy\t37 (28.9%)\t\nCorticosteroid therapy\t7 (5.5%)\t\nHormonal therapy\t24 (18.8%)\t\nAntiangiogenic therapy\t5 (3.9%)\t\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw\tPresence of MRONJ\t88 (68.8%)\t\nTime since initial diagnosis of MRONJ (years)\t3.0 [1.7\u20135.1]\t\nLocation of MRONJ\tUpper jaw: 31 (32.0%)\t\nLower jaw: 66 (68.0%)\t\nDrug holiday\t13 (10.2%)\t\nSurgical therapy\t81 (92.0%)\t\nMedical history\tHypertension\t43 (33.6%)\t\nDiabetes mellitus\t8 (6.3%)\t\nDiseases of cardio-pulmonary system\t49 (38.3%)\t\nThyroid malfunctions\t29 (22.7%)\t\nRheumatic diseases\t10 (7.8%)\t\nInfectious diseases\t1 (0.8%)\t\nIntraoral findings\tNumber of teeth\t2211 (100%)\t\n20.0 [11.3\u201325.0]\t\nUpper jaw\t10.0 [4.0\u201312.0]\t\nLower jaw\t11.0 [6.0\u201313.0]\t\nRetained root\t5 (3.9%)\t\nPatients with dental implants prior to ART\t34 (26.6%)\t\nNumber of dental implants\t139 (6.3%)*\t\nPeriodontal disease\t88 (68.8%)\t\nApical periodontitis\t48 (37.5%)\t\nDental cysts\t5 (3.9%)\t\nDenture use\t52 (40.6%)\t\nDental procedures\t60 (46.8%)\t\n*Percentage measured according to absolute number of teeth\n\nData acquisition and analysis\n\nData acquisition was performed retrospectively and derived from patients\u2019 medical records in a yes/no manner according to the previously performed primary and follow-up examinations (see Table 2).\n\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS Version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) as well as R Version 4.0.3. Initially all non-nominal data were analyzed for normal distribution applying a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test.\n\nThe statistical differences between the three groups were evaluated using T-test, Chi-square test, and ANOVA or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with post hoc analysis applying a Bonferroni test. Analysis of certain risk factors for the development of MRONJ was furthermore conducted by applying logistic regression.\n\nPatient cohort and characteristics\n\nIn total, 273 individuals were identified as having received ART with DNO, 145 patients met one or more exclusion criteria and were excluded from this study (see Fig.\u00a01), and 128 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median follow-up on 31 December 2020 (end of data acquisition) was 14.0 [12.7\u201320.2] months with a maximum follow-up time of 80 and a minimum of 12\u00a0months (see Table 1).\n\nMost of the patients in our cohort suffered from stage IV cancer (of which breast and prostate cancer were the prominent malignant diseases) followed by osteoporosis. All cancer patients had at least one or multiple skeletal metastases. The median time since initial diagnosis of underlying disease was 9\u00a0years.\n\nPatients received most frequently DNO in the dosage 120\u00a0mg in 60.9%, 37 patients (28.9%) patients received chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy, 24 patients (18.8%) were treated with a hormonal therapy. Seven patients (5.5%) received an additional corticosteroid therapy, 5 patients (3.9%) received antiangiogenic therapy, and 42 patients (32.8%) had received ART with BP before DNO treatment (see Fig.\u00a01).\n\nThe main variable MRONJ was present in 88 patients (68.8%) with a median time since initial diagnosis of MRONJ of 3\u00a0years. MRONJ was found in the upper jaw in 31 cases (32.0%), in 66 cases (68.0%) in the lower jaw, and in 9 patients (7.0%) in both jaws. Surgical therapy of MRONJ lesions was performed in 81 cases (92.0%). A discontinuation of ART at the time of the dental procedure was performed in 13 cases (10.2%). Of note, the investigators of the study gave no recommendation on drug holiday. The ART prescribing physician initiated the drug holiday.\n\nThe most frequent co-morbidities were diseases of cardio-pulmonary system hypertension in 49 patients (38.3%), followed by arterial hypertension in 43 patients (33.6%), thyroid malfunctions in 29 patients (22.7%), rheumatic diseases in 10 patients (7.8%), and diabetes mellitus in 8 patients (6.3%).\n\nIntraoral findings presented a total number of 2211 teeth with a median of 10 in the upper and 11 in the lower jaw. Five patients (3.9%) had a retained root, 88 patients (68.8%) revealed moderate to severe periodontal disease, 48 patients (37.5%) had apical periodontitis, 5 patients (3.9%) had dental cysts, and 52 patients (40.6%) were using removable dentures. In 60 patients (46.8%) dental surgical procedures were performed. A total of 139 dental implants prior to ART were found in 34 patients (26.6%) with a median of 3 implants per patient (see Table 2).\n\nThe cohort was divided into three groups dependent on the presence of MRONJ and the antiresorptive medication:Group I (control): n\u2009=\u200940 15 males (37.5%) and 25 females (62.5%) with a median age of 69.8\u00a0years.

Patients suffering from cancer (n\u2009=\u200986) as underlying disease showed a significantly higher presence of MRONJ (p\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to patients suffering from osteoporosis (n\u2009=\u200956) (see Fig.\u00a02). Patients receiving high-dose (120\u00a0mg) DNO (n\u2009=\u200978) presented more onset of MRONJ compared to patients receiving low-dose (60\u00a0mg) DNO (n\u2009=\u200950) (see Fig.\u00a03).Fig. 2 Mosaic plot: underlying disease vs. presence of MRONJ\n\nFig. 3 Mosaic plot: DNO dosage vs. presence of MRONJ\n\nEven though there were significantly more women (n\u2009=\u200979) than men (n\u2009=\u200949) included in this study, the variable \u201csex\u201d was not identified as a risk factor and MRONJ onset was distributed equally for both genders (see Fig.\u00a04).Fig. 4 Mosaic plot: sex vs. presence of MRONJ\n\nTo further define risk factors, these previously identified parameters were analyzed performing logistic regression. The variable duration of ART (OR 1.07 [1.00\u20131.13], p\u2009=\u20090.04), breast cancer (OR 2.83 [1.12\u20137.12], p\u2009=\u20090.03), chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy (2.97 [1.18\u20137.46], p\u2009=\u20090.02), hormonal therapy (6.33 [1.41\u201328.43], p\u2009=\u20090.02), hypertension (2.96 [1.22\u20137.16], p\u2009=\u20090.02), periodontal disease (2.46 [1.12\u20135.40], p\u2009=\u20090.03), apical ostitis (2.04 [0.92\u20134.51], p\u2009=\u20090.02), and use of dentures (2.74 [1.20\u20136.28], p\u2009=\u20090.02) presented significant predictors of MRONJ onset with an odds ratio larger than 1 (see Table 4).Table 4 Risk factors for MRONJ onset in logistic regression analyses\n\nVariables\tOdds ratio [CI]\tp-Value\t\nDuration of ART\t1.07 [1.00\u20131.13]\t0.037\t\nBreast cancer\t2.83 [1.12\u20137.12]\t0.027\t\nChemotherapy\t2.97 [1.18\u20137.46]\t0.021\t\nHormonal therapy\t6.33 [1.41\u201328.43]\t0.016\t\nHypertension\t2.96 [1.22\u20137.16]\t0.016\t\nPeriodontal disease\t2.46 [1.12\u20135.40]\t0.026\t\nApical ostitis\t2.04 [0.92\u20134.51]\t0.018\t\nDenture use\t2.74 [1.20\u20136.28]\t0.017\t\nCI confidence interval, p significance\n\nThe variables drug holiday (OR 0.24 [0.07\u20130.79], p\u2009=\u20090.02) and presence of dental implants prior to ART (0.85 [0.189\u20131.018], p\u2009=\u20090.04) however were identified to decrease the risk of MRONJ onset in this study (see Table 5).Table 5 Factors decreasing the risk of MRONJ in logistic regression analyses\n\nVariables\tOdds ratio [CI]\tp-Value\t\nDrug holiday\t0.241 [0.073\u20130.792]\t0.019\t\nDental implants prior to ART\t0.846 [0.189\u20131.018]\t0.043\t\nCI confidence interval, p significance\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results of this study revealed that higher DNO dosage, additional chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and corticosteroid therapy, breast cancer as underlying disease, co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes mellitus, periodontal disease and apical periodontitis, and the use of dentures elevate the risk of MRONJ onset in patients treated with DNO. A minor effect was also associated with prolonged intake of DNO.\n\nWhen comparing the afore mentioned risk factors for onset of MRONJ in patients treated with DNO and those previously described for onset of MRONJ in patients treated with BP (see Table 1) it becomes clear that these findings correlate well. Considering the different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BP and DNO, this underlines the importance of inflammatory processes as the main triggering events [11, 15] in the development of MRONJ.\n\nRisk factors\n\nFor BP it was shown that co-medications such as chemotherapy or corticosteroid therapy alongside local risk factors, e.g., dental procedures, apical ostitis, and periodontal disease, presented a significant impact on the onset of MRONJ [15, 23, 39, 43]. The female gender as well as breast cancer as an underlying disease were also identified as having a predilection for MRONJ [44\u201348].\n\nIn a recent study patients under DNO therapy with absence and presence of MRONJ were compared [13]; however, the sample size with n\u2009=\u200914 was limited. The number of patients in the present study was considerably higher and an additional investigation group was added: patients under antiresorptive therapy with a medication switch from BP to DNO and the presence of MRONJ. The three investigated groups presented statistically significant differences in regard to the underlying disease, the dosage of DNO, co-medications, additional diseases, and intraoral findings.\n\nThe number of patients suffering from stage IV cancer was significantly higher in both MRONJ groups (DNO and DNO/BP) compared to the control group whose population predominantly suffered from osteoporosis. This result is concordant to the dosage of DNO distributed among the groups: high-dose DNO (120\u00a0mg) was mainly found in the MRONJ groups, whereas low-dose DNO (60\u00a0mg) was the main DNO derivate in the control group with no onset of MRONJ. The results of this study suggest that higher doses of DNO elevate the risk of MRONJ.\n\nCo-medications such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and corticosteroid therapy pose a significant risk to the development of DNO associated MRONJ. This can be explained by the fact that these medications might lead to immunosuppression and thus, indirectly, alter the risk of local inflammation and consecutively the onset of MRONJ. Breast cancer as an underlying disease was also associated with an elevated MRONJ risk [48\u201350].\n\nHypertension and with less impact also diabetes mellitus as vascular diseases were also identified as risk factors. An impaired vascular system decreases the blood circulation of bone structures particularly of bones with exceptional blood supply as well as a high proportion of cortical structures such as the lower jaw [15] and thus possibly abating the onset of MRONJ.\n\nPeriodontal disease, apical periodontitis, and the use of dentures were shown to elevate the risk of MRONJ. This is concordant with the theory of inflammation as a key factor in the pathogenesis of MRONJ. On the one hand mucosal inflammation due to periodontal diseases and denture-associated sore spots pose a continuous stimulus on mucosal integrity. Micro-lesions in mucosa and periodontal apparatus thus enable oral bacteria to penetrate into the bone and cause local inflammation [51]. Due to the reduced osteoclast activity under ART the defense ability towards bone infections is markedly reduced. These observations support the hypothesis that local inflammations are of paramount importance in the pathogenesis of MRONJ [18, 25, 52].\n\nEven though regular consumption of alcohol and smoking did not pose significant risk factors for MRONJ in this study, they are clear risk factors for oral diseases, e.g., periodontal disease and impaired wound healing, thus indirectly favoring the development of MRONJ [53].\n\nThese findings correlate well with those of the few other studies we found. Okuma et al. [13] furthermore showed that prolonged DNO intake and sex influence onset of MRONJ. In this study prolonged intake of DNO did only present a mild risk of MRONJ. It is however a logical consequence that longer DNO application adds to the likelihood of triggering events taking place. This is in line with the findings of other studies demonstrating that prolonged intake of DNO significantly increased the development of MRONJ [38, 54]. As for sex, it is readily assumed that gender may present a risk factor; however, it needs to be considered that mainly female patients are affected by breast cancer and osteoporosis [22] and thus shift the balance of patients receiving ART to the female gender.\n\nDental implants\n\nTaking a closer look at dental implants as a risk factor for increased MRONJ onset in patients treated with BP results are ambiguously, if not contrary. In a recent overview evaluating several studies on the impact of dental implants on the onset of MRONJ, dental implants were identified as a risk factor [55]. The same conclusion was drawn from another working group by Jacobsen et al. [56] showing that dental implants were risk factors for MRONJ onset in patients treated with BP, whereas in a Korean cohort, these results could not be confirmed by Ryu, Kim, and Kwon [31].\n\nTo our knowledge, the impact of dental implants in patients treated with DNO has been scarcely investigated [14] and was therefore a key finding of this study. When applying logistic regression (see Table 5) it was revealed that the presence of dental implants prior to ART did not increase but instead decrease the risk of MRONJ onset in patients treated with DNO. This finding could be related to a potentially better oral hygiene in patients caring for the dental implants compared to those without dental implants, as those patients with dental implants prior to ART presented fewer cases of periodontitis in this study. Whatever the reason may be, we can assert from this study that the presence of dental implants prior to ART does not impact onset of MRONJ negatively. Periimplantitis, as a risk factor for MRONJ, seems to be as significant as periodontitis and should be avoided just as much in patients at risk. A poor oral hygiene appears to have a significant impact on the development of MRONJ in patients treated with DNO just as it has been reported in those patients treated with BP [7, 15].\n\nMedication switch\n\nThe assumed impact of a medication switch from BP to DNO did not however influence MRONJ onset. When compared to one another, groups II (DNO) and III (DNO/BP) did not show an increased MRONJ risk or a significant difference in risk factors. A similar result has been reported in a previous study by the same investigators as of this study [42]. In afore mentioned study it was also shown that a medication switch did neither influence the time to onset of MRONJ nor the outcome after surgical MRONJ therapy negatively.\n\nDrug holiday\n\nThe number of patients receiving a drug holiday in this study was relatively low, and these findings should be evaluated with care. A finding of this study was that the risk of MRONJ could be reduced by more than 75% in patients undergoing a drug holiday around dental procedures. A large prospective study would be advisable for future studies addressing this aspect.\n\nThe appliance of a drug holiday is widely discussed. Osteologists and oncologists [24, 57, 58] often advise not to pause ART even for a short term as the onset of skeletal related events (SRE) may yet occur. A meta-analysis of multiple studies concerning drug holidays has shown that a drug holiday does not reduce risk of MRONJ [55]. However, most studies in this meta-analysis focused on BP not on DNO. Two studies addressed the influence of a DNO drug holiday on the wound healing after the onset of MRONJ [14, 59]. Regarding the pharmacological differences between BP and DNO a short-termed DNO drug holiday surrounding a possible triggering event, like tooth extraction, could very well decrease the risk of MRONJ.\n\nDiscontinuation of DNO\n\nThere was no recommendation from the authors to discontinue the antiresorptive therapy neither for BP nor for DNO. However, in several cases the ART was stopped by the prescribing oncologist/practitioner. Due to the fact that the pharmacological effect of denosumab attenuates within weeks there is a substantiation for a drug holiday. Nevertheless, the decision for a discontinuation should be an interdisciplinary one. There are no recommendations in the German guidelines for prostate carcinoma, breast cancer, or multiple myeloma for the discontinuation of ART with DNO [60\u201362].\n\nLimitations\n\nThe limitation of the present study is the small sample size evaluated. Due to the retrospective character of this study, inclusion in the study was defined after a predefined period of time. However, for further evidence the present data can be used for power estimations of a prospective trial in the future. Another limitation is the heterogeneous intake of antiresorptive medication, underlying disease, and immunomodulatory co-medications. Nevertheless, the application of multifactorial regression models (considering covariance as medication types and/or underlying disease) should be the aim in subsequent confirmatory studies. Of note, it will be increasingly difficultly to find pure intervention groups in the future. This might be progressively part of the discussion when performing MRONJ studies. However, we tried our best to create large and comparable study groups, all of whom were operated on by the same surgeon and followed regular check-ups.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study revealed statistically significant correlations of the onset of MRONJ in patients treated with DNO in patients receiving higher DNO dosage, additional chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and corticosteroid therapy, those suffering from breast cancer, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, periodontal disease and apical periodontitis, and those using dentures. A minor effect was associated with prolonged intake of DNO.\n\nThese findings correlate well with risk factors associated with MRONJ onset in patients treated with BP. MRONJ onset is a multi-factorial event that occurs in patients receiving BP as well as those treated with DNO despite the medication\u2019s different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. This underlines the importance of inflammatory processes as the main triggering event in the development of MRONJ. Concluding that prophylactic treatment prior to DNO application as well as regular oral examinations and carefully performed dental procedures after DNO application are fundamental elements in MRONJ prevention and patients at risk need to be educated that good dental hygiene is paramount to reduce MRONJ development.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Dipl.

With an incidence of 0.17/million individuals and a slight male preference, HS presents with a wide age distribution [1,3,4,5]. Most commonly, it occurs as a primary malignancy; however, in approximately 25% of the cases a presumed transdifferentiation of a preexisting hematolymphoid disorder can be demonstrated [6]. The clinical presentation varies from a localized solitary mass to a severely disseminated disease often with extranodal involvement including skin, soft tissue, the gastrointestinal tract and the hematopoietic system [7]. Systemic symptoms in terms of weight loss, fever and night sweats often occur [8]. The diagnostic work-up of HS is extremely challenging due to the rarity of the disease as well as a wide differential diagnosis in terms of a histologic overlap with diverse mimics [7]. No standardized treatment for HS exists and especially in a disseminated disease the clinical course is overly aggressive with a dismal outcome. The median overall survival from the time of diagnosis is approximately six months [4]. We report a 43-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male admitted to our hospitals with abdominal pain and a feeling of fatigue. We demonstrate both the challenges of a correct diagnosis and an effective treatment as well as the aggressive nature of histiocytic sarcoma (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4).\n\nTo summarize, this case clearly demonstrates the challenging course of patients with histiocytic sarcoma. The rareness and severe complexity of HS requires a multidisciplinary and specialized approach throughout the diagnostic workout, treatment and follow-up. A rapid establishment of a correct diagnosis, staging of the disease and a personalized, aggressive treatment strategy is essential to improve outcomes in these patients. Even so, the prognosis remains extremely dismal, especially in the case of a disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nK.F.A., L.D.S., P.K. and T.B.P. acquired and interpreted the data.

The patient complained of constant pain in the epigastric region and under the right and left rib curvature for the previous week upon admission. The pain was intensified when bending forwards and accompanied by an unspecific feeling of fatigue. The patient reported similar symptoms three weeks prior to admission, which remitted spontaneously. Any systemic symptoms of fever, unintended weight loss or night sweats were denied. At admission, the patient had a slight tachycardia; all other vital parameters were normal. Initial laboratory data came out with an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 176 mg/L) and a slightly elevated total leukocyte count (9.8 \u00d7 109/L). Hepatic and renal biochemical markers were within normal ranges. On physical examination the abdomen was described as tender in the upper quadrants and around the umbilicus but without peritoneal reaction. On suspicion of an intraabdominal abscess, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed showing free liquid surrounding the liver and the spleen as well as in the small pelvis. There was no free air. However, the upper abdomen was seen with a diffuse reaction in the fatty tissue around the pylorus and ventricle. Radiologically, a perforated ulcer was suspected. The patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, revealing peritonitis in all quadrants and three liters of free fluid. There were no signs of feces, pus or bile. The greater omentum was adherent in a conglomerate consisting of the duodenum, ventricle, pancreas and transverse colon. It was not possible to get a sufficient overview of the structures laparoscopically and the procedure was converted to an explorative laparotomy revealing reactive, stearin-like changes spread in the peritoneal cavity ((A,B), white arrows). The conglomerate was dissected and the posterior part of the ventricle was inspected, revealing no ulcers. The duodenum was mobilized by the Kocher maneuver, also revealing no ulcers or perforation. Perioperatively, an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy was performed, revealing no ulcerations or pathology. A piece of the omentum was removed for histopathological examination and an intraabdominal drain was placed before ending the procedure. The findings were suspected to be caused by pancreatitis. The postoperative course was uneventful, the drain was removed after seven days and the patient was discharged after eight days with a plan of outpatient follow-up. On postoperative day 17 he was readmitted for drainage of 3.5 L ascites, which had recollected. The pancreas was without signs of pancreatitis on a triple-phase CT. Diagnostic ultrasound described no gallstones.\n\nFigure 2 Histopathology of omental infiltrate and ascitic fluid: (A) Omental fatty tissue with diffuse infiltration of tumor cells (HE\u00d74). (B) The tumor cells were large with vesicular nuclei. Frequent mitoses were seen (HE\u00d740). (C) CD68PGM1 showing characteristic granular cytoplasmic staining (\u00d740). (D) Cytomorphology of the tumor cells in ascitic fluid (\u00d740). A histopathological examination of the resected tissue from the omentum demonstrated a dense and diffuse infiltration of the fatty tissue by large mononuclear cells with large vesicular nuclei with eosinophilic nucleoli. The cytoplasm was eosinophilic with some vacuolization. The cells were of a hematological origin and expressed CD45. They had a fully developed histiocytic differentiation profile with an immunohistochemical expression of CD68, CD163, CD4, CD56 and lysozyme and showed a high proliferative rate that in areas reached 50% (Ki-67). The precursor cell, dendritic cell, melanocytic, neuroendocrine cell, B-cell, T-cell and Langerhans cell markers were negative. No BRAF-mutation could be demonstrated. The PD-L1 was negative. Next generation sequencing (NGS) could not demonstrate any fusions. The NGS panel used was \u2018Archers FusionPlex Lymphoma\u2019, investigating the mutation, expression and fusion of 125 genes. Ascitic fluid cytology revealed malignant cells with the same phenotype as the tumor tissue in the omentum. The findings were most compatible with histiocytic sarcoma (HS). A differential diagnosis could be monoblastic leukemia, which was excluded on the examination of bone marrow biopsies. It took 24 days from initial hospitalization until diagnosis, which was confirmed by an expert second opinion. The following day the patient was transferred to a specialized hematological department at a tertiary hospital.\n\nFigure 3 Hybrid imaging with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/CT (2-[18F]FDG PET/CT) was performed for the staging of the disease and as baseline for monitoring of the treatment response. Imaging performed 1 h post-injection of 4.0 MBq/kg 2-[18F]FDG showed a moderately metabolically active, irregular thickening of the peritoneal folds and extensive carcinomatosis-like infiltration in the omentum, mesentery and the pelvic cavity (A\u2013D, yellow arrows). There was minor ascitic fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavities. There were also metabolically active, enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and upper retroperitoneum. The findings were considered highly suspicious for malignancy. At this point, plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, a future tumor marker in this patient, were elevated (366 U/L; reference range 105\u2013205 U/L). An initial steroid treatment with prednisolone 100 mg/daily had a good effect on the tendency of the recollection of ascites. However, as no standardized treatment for this patient category without comorbidity exists, a hematological specialized tumor board, after consent from the patient, decided to administer a chemotherapy regimen of ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE), which was initiated one month after initial hospitalization. The patient tolerated the treatment well. At clinical follow-up after two cycles of ICE, the patient\u2019s wellbeing was improved, the plasma LDH was normalized and imaging with 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT demonstrated a substantial partial response (PR), both metabolically and morphologically, of the previously described findings in the peritoneum. There were still metabolically active, carcinomatosis-like findings in the omentum, mesentery and on the liver surface (E\u2013H, magenta arrows). There were no pathological lymph nodes. After completion of four cycles of ICE, the metabolic complete response (CR) and a further morphological PR were reported on follow-up 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT (not shown). The plasma LDH was still within a normal range. The patient tolerated the fifth and final cycle of ICE well.\n\nFigure 4 To reduce the risk of HS relapse, an experimental therapeutic approach with high-dose chemotherapy administering a BEAM (carmustine + etoposide + cytarabine + melphalan) regimen and a subsequent autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) was initiated. The patient tolerated the treatment well and at follow-up +60 days after BEAM/SCT the regeneration of bone marrow was considered complete and the tumor marker plasma LDH was still within the reference range (157 U/L). 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT (A) demonstrated a metabolic CR and a further morphological PR. There were now relatively symmetrically localized, metabolically active lymph nodes at the right root of the neck, in both sides of the mediastinum and the lung hilum (black arrow), compatible with possible granulomatous inflammation. Two months later the patient reported a gradual worsening of bone pain in the lumbar and pelvic region. The plasma LDH was now elevated (450 U/L) and thrombocyte and hemoglobin levels were low. A relapse of HS was suspected, which was confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy that showed a massive infiltration of almost 100% of malignant histiocytic cells with blastoid morphology and an immunohistochemical profile similar to previous specimens. Findings on 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT (B) were compatible with a relapse, demonstrating a heterogeneous, pathologically increased FDG-uptake in the bone marrow in the axial and peripheral skeleton (green arrows). There were metabolically active lymph nodes above and now also below the diaphragm. A malignant bone marrow infiltration with a myeloid expansion was considered the cause of the patient\u2019s bone pain. The plasma LDH rose rapidly to 5100 U/L and salvage therapy with an acute myelogenous leukemia regime (CLAG-M; cladribine + cytarabine + mitoxantrone) was initiated. The treatment had a good effect on the patient\u2019s bone pain and wellbeing. The plasma LDH was normalized within days and histopathological examinations showed no tumor cells in the blood and no malignant cells in the bone marrow biopsy. 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT (C) demonstrated a metabolic PR of previously malignant findings in the bone marrow. There were now splenic lesions compatible with abscesses. A second course of CLAG-M was administered and, as the patient had achieved a second CR confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy, a non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT was considered. However, within a short period of time the patient again reported bone pain and he developed cutaneous papules on the trunk end lower extremity from which a biopsy showed HS. The plasma LDH also increased rapidly and 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT (not shown) again demonstrated progression with a pathologically increased FDG-uptake in the bone marrow and new metabolically active cutaneous lesions on the abdomen. The findings were compatible with a systemic relapse and an allogeneic SCT was now not a feasible treatment option. Palliative treatment with a modified FLAG-Ida regime (fludarabine + cytarabine + idarubicin + filgrastim) initially had a good effect on the bone pain; the cutaneous lesions regressed and the plasma LDH decreased. However, the effect was short-lived and the patient experienced intermittent fever, bone pain, fatigue and blood cell counts that demonstrated cytopenia. The plasma LDH again increased. The patient\u2019s clinical condition worsened significantly and after short periods of treatment with high-dose cytarabine and hydroxycarbamide, further treatment attempts with intensive regimen chemotherapy were considered futile. No appropriate protocolled treatment was found suitable for the patient and the treatment aim of long term survival was abated. The patient passed away shortly after, 15 months after his initial hospitalization.\n\nPublisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could reestablish the micro-ecological balance in IgAN, although this has never been attempted before. We explored whether FMT could be efficacious in treating IgAN in two patients with refractory IgAN.\nTwo Chinese female patients with IgAN failed to achieve clinical remission after receiving several rounds of immunosuppressive therapy and suffered from unbearable adverse effects due to immunosuppressants. Both patients received intensive fresh FMT conducted through transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) regularly for 6-7\u2009months, and were followed up for a further 6\u2009months. Partial clinical remission was achieved in both patients, evidenced by a decrease in the 24-h urinary protein (24-hUP) to less than half of baseline during FMT treatment or follow-up, along with increased serum albumin (sAlb) and stable kidney function. The gut microbiota of both patients was distorted with lower biodiversity and altered composition, which was reversed following FMT. Phylum Proteobacteria decreased while genus Prevotella increased during and after FMT. The intensive fresh FMT was well-tolerated, and no severe adverse events occurred.\nPreliminary evidence of the safety and efficacy of FMT for treating refractory IgAN may provide a new direction by which to decipher the pathogenesis of IgAN.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerular disease with an annual worldwide incidence of 25 per 100,000 populations [1]. The current dominant theory of IgAN pathogenesis is that immune complexes characterized bygalactose-deficient IgA1 (GdIgA1) are deposited in the glomerular mesangial area, causing kidney impairment [2]. Increasing evidence indicates that gut dysbiosis plays a role in IgAN. Animal experiments showed that GdIgA1 production depended on the gut commensal microbiota [3]. Genetic studies revealed that risk alleles associated with IgAN were also implicated in dysfunction of the gut barrier and regulation of the mucosal immune response to pathogens [4]. Budesonide released in the distal ileum decreased proteinuria of IgAN patients, attributed to restoration of intestinal mucosal immunity [5]. Lubiprostone also alleviated proteinuria and kidney dysfunction in two patients with IgAN [6], attributed to manipulation of gut dysbiosis and reductions in uremic toxins [7]. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been explored in the management of some dysbiosis-related diseases with relatively high safety and efficacy [8]. However, the application of FMT in treating IgAN has not been reported before. We administered intensive fresh FMT to two patients with refractory IgAN and gut dysbiosis. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. The treatment was approved by the ethics committee for clinical trials of the Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in China (KY20172080-1).\n\nCase presentation\n\nCase 1\n\nPatient A was a 48-year-old woman who was referred to the Department of Nephrology of Xijing hospital due to renal dysfunction and persistent heavy proteinuria. Examination revealed: body height 165\u2009cm, weight 60\u2009kg, blood pressure 135/72\u2009mmHg, 24-h urinary protein (24-hUP) 2605\u2009mg, serum creatinine (sCr) 106\u2009\u00b5mol/L, serum albumin (sAlb) 32.8\u2009g/L, and estimated glomerular filtration ratio (eGFR) 51.0\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2. Kidney biopsy revealed IgAN (Lee III, M1E1S1T0-C1). She initially in 1997 presented with gross hematuria, but did not receive any intervention. In July 2006, she was prescribed benazepril hydrochloride (gradually increased to maximum tolerated dose) when 24-hUP reached 2300\u2009mg and urine occult blood (2+). However, edema occurred intermittently in both lower extremities and eyelids. She was not willing to administer glucocorticoid when she was awake to the potential adverse effect. In May 2017, she received tacrolimus (2\u2009mg, b.i.d.) and valsartan amlodipine (one tablet, q.d.). Tacrolimus was reduced to 1\u2009mg (b.i.d.) on 1 July 2017 and discontinued on 11 February 2018 due to severe hand tremor. Unfortunately, proteinuria was maintained around 2089\u2009mg, and sCr increased to 128\u2009\u00b5mol/L. She then received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 0.5\u2009g, b.i.d.) from 26 April 2018. MMF was discontinued after 1.5\u2009months due to intense gastro-intestinal discomfort. At that time, tests showed 24-hUP 2020\u2009mg and urine occult blood (4+). Considering the poor response and intolerance to immunosuppressive drugs (Supplemental Digital Content, Table S1), we defined her condition as refractory, and treated her with intensive fresh FMT after a month of wash-out.\n\nFMT was performed 40 times consecutively (200\u2009mL daily, 5\u2009d/week) according to the protocol reported by Sudarshan Paramsothy et\u00a0al. [9], and then a further 57 times (200\u2009mL daily, 10\u201315\u2009d/month) over the next 5\u2009months. Valsartan amlodipine was administered during FMT treatment and follow-up. Two healthy young men were selected to donate fresh feces; the findings of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory test of the two donors are described in Supplemental Digital Content Table S2. The procedure of FMT is shown in Supplemental Digital Content File 1. The patient was followed for six months after ceasing treatment (Figure 1(A)). The 24-hUP showed a slow downward trend during and after FMT, decreasing by 37.0% after 97 FMTs and to less than half of baseline three months after FMT, achieving partial clinical remission. The sAlb increased by 21.9 and 32.6% after treatment and follow-up compared to the baseline, respectively, supporting the reduction of protein loss. The sCr and eGFR fluctuated around the baseline, suggesting stable kidney function during and after the treatment process (Table 1, Figure 1(D)).\n\nFigure 1.

Additionally, Phylum Proteobacteria was found with decreasing abundance, while genus Prevotella with increasing abundance, during FMT (Supplemental Digital Content, Figures S2 and S3). The patient developed red papules on the limbs and body (skin biopsy showed spongioticdermatitis), and was infected with influenza A virus during hospitalization for FMT, and recovered after appropriate treatment.\n\nFigure 2.

A Red solid line indicates the trend.\n\nCase 2\n\nPatient B was a 32-year-old woman who was referred to our center due to persistent heavy proteinuria. Examination revealed: body height 165\u2009cm, weight 55\u2009kg, blood pressure 110/65\u2009mmHg, 24-hUP 1320\u2009mg, sCr 100\u2009\u00b5mol/L, sAlb 37.8\u2009g/L, and eGFR 59.2\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2. She initially noted foamy urine in April 2016, and underwent kidney biopsy with a diagnosis of IgAN (Lee III) in her local hospital, when tests showed 24-hUP 3614.7\u2009mg, urine occult blood (+), sCr 61\u2009\u00b5mol/L, and sAlb 33.6\u2009g/L. She received prednisone (60\u2009mg, q.d.), cyclophosphamide (intravenous, 1\u2009g every 4\u2009weeks), and candesartan (4\u2009mg, q.d.) for 3\u2009months. However, 24-hUP was not controlled and fluctuated between 4277.8\u2009and 6320.8\u2009mg. She then received tacrolimus (2\u2009mg, b.i.d), prednisone, and irbesartan (150\u2009mg, q.d; gradually increased to maximum tolerated dose) for 12\u2009months. The 24-hUP decreased to 840\u2009mg in August 2017, but never dropped further. Meanwhile, she developed severe tremors and alopecia. In March 2018, she was prescribed MMF (0.75\u2009g, b.i.d) for 3\u2009months. Unfortunately, the 24-hUP still did not decrease, sCr increased to 100\u2009\u00b5mol/L, and sAlb deceased to 37.8\u2009g/L. Immunosuppressive therapy failed to further improve her condition which was considered as refractory IgAN (Supplemental Digital Content, Table S4). The above therapy was discontinued for three months by which time 24-hUP increased to 2490\u2009mg, and sAlb deceased to 32.6\u2009g/L. We treated her with intensive fresh FMT, 60 treatments in 6\u2009months (200\u2009mL daily, 10\u201315\u2009d/month), and followed up for 6\u2009months (Figure 2(A)). Valsartan was prescribed during the FMT treatment and follow-up.\n\nThe 24-hUP presented a fast downward trend during FMT, decreasing to less than half of baseline after 10 FMTs and by 62.8% after 60 FMTs, achieving partial clinical remission which was maintained until the third month of follow-up. Meanwhile, sAlb increased by 19.6 and 29.1% after treatment and follow-up, and there was evidence of stable kidney function (Table 1; Figure 2(D)).\n\nAlteration of parameters of gut microbiota before and after FMT was similar to that of patient A, with the addition of decreasing Verrucomicrobia during FMT [Figure 2(B,C); Supplemental Digital Content (Tables S5 and S6 and Figures S1\u2013S3)]. The patient developed diarrhea once daily for three non-consecutive days within 4\u2009h after receiving FMT, without further progression. She reported temporary but severe discomfort when deploying the transendoscopic enteral tube through colonoscopy each time, and alternatively chose retention enema on the sixth occasion.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of the management of IgAN with FMT. Two patients, who failed to achieve clinical remission after receiving several rounds of immunosuppressive therapy and experienced drug intolerance, reached partial clinical remission along with stable kidney function after receiving intensive fresh FMT for 6\u20137\u2009months. The intensive fresh FMT was well tolerated and neither patient experienced severe adverse events. Despite the different patterns of remission, these findings may indicate encouraging efficacy of FMT compared to immunosuppressive strategies in patients with refractory IgAN. The gut dysbiosis present in both patients, possibly attributable to the disease or its drug treatment, was restored by intensive FMT with increased diversity and a more balanced composition compared to baseline. The patients received different FMT regimens with the aim of exploring the optimum dose, a long process of FMT may have a more stable efficacy, which may provide a basic notion for the later clinical trial and needs further verification. The longer treatment period was well-tolerated except for discomfort when deploying the transendoscopic enteral tube through colonoscopy each time, which raised the need for a more comfortable approach. Patient A developed pityriasisrosea during treatment, which has not been reported before and may be a negative response to FMT on systemic immunity.\n\nFMT is effective and safe for restoring a diverse and balanced microbiome profile, and has been applied in the management of several dysbiosis-related diseases. Therefore, it is feasible that FMT could be safe and effective for treating IgAN in patients with evidence of gut dysbiosis. An abundance of phylum Proteobacteria and a reduced abundance of genus Prevotella observed prior to FMT in both patients is consistent with the characteristics of gut microbiota in patients with chronic kidney disease [10]. Altered gut microbiota profiles in IgAN patients have been documented previously and Prevotella sp [11], Prevotella copri [11], and Prevotella_9 [12] were significantly decreased, and the reversal of this imbalance during FMT to some extent supports our findings. Interestingly, Proteobacteria was also expanded in the blood microbiome of patients with chronic kidney disease [13], providing evidence for bacterial translocation through a \u2018leaking\u2019 gut barrier. Sputum Proteobacteria was also associated with bronchiectasis severity [14]. Gamma-Proteobacteria was enriched in newborn mice and depleted in normal adult microbiota, which was regulated by a gamma-Proteobacteria-specific IgA response. A higher abundance of gamma-Proteobacteria was associated with sustained intestinal inflammation [15]. However, gut dysbiosis and IgAN may interact as both cause and effect, and the mechanism by which these altered bacterial taxa or micro-ecological imbalance play a role in the progression of IgAN warrants further investigation.\n\nWe did not examine alterations in the intestinal mucosal immune system and uremia profile before and after FMT, and at this stage cannot identify whether FMT improved the abnormal mucosal immune system or mitigated the accumulation of toxins. However, a pilot study to further explore the efficacy of FMT in IgAN is underway.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank the two patients and their families for participating in this study, the two donors for contributing fecal specimen, nursing team of nephrology of Xijing hospital for caring the patients during the procedure, and Shanghai Mobio Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd. for bioinformatics analysis.\n\nEthical approval\n\nThe treatment was approved by the ethics committee for clinical trials of the Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in China, and conducted ethically in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.

Very few cases of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection have been reported. Atraumatic splenic rupture, while rare, is associated with high mortality. Here, we report the first case of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection in the English literature and review the prior reported literature.

Introduction\n\nInfluenza viruses are divided into three types, influenza A, B, and C viruses. Influenza A viruses cause epidemic influenza and sporadic pandemics, and they are further classified into subtypes on the basis of the antigenic properties of two surface glycopeptides, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different H subtypes and 11 different N subtypes (H1 to H18 and N1 to N11). Influenza A (H1N1), which caused a world pandemic in 2009, is one of the common influenza viruses and is now included in each year's influenza vaccine [1].\n\nInfluenza infection may present with fever, chills, headache, myalgia, malaise, and anorexia, accompanied by respiratory symptoms, including nonproductive cough, nasal discharge, and sore throat [1]. Some patients may develop pneumonia, respiratory failure, and other organ damage [2].\n\nVery few cases [3\u20137] of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection have been reported in the literature. Atraumatic splenic rupture, is rare and, if missed, can be associated with high mortality [8]. We report the first case in the English literature of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection and review the prior reported literature.\n\n2. Case Presentation\n\nA 50-year-old man with past medical history of hypothyroidism and cigarette smoking had been on vacation in Florida, USA, with his family for 3 weeks. The day of his return flight in July, he developed a sore throat and body aches followed by fever and a productive cough. He went to urgent care, was diagnosed with acute bronchitis, and was treated as outpatient with azithromycin and prednisone for 5 days without improvement. On the eighth day of symptoms, he developed confusion and was brought to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation.\n\nIn the ED, the patient had mild shortness of breath but denied nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. On physical exam, he had temperature 38.3\u00b0C, heart rate 120 beats/min, respiratory rate 25 breaths/min, and SpO2 90% on room air, with coarse breath sounds bilaterally on lung exam; he was started on oxygen 2\u2009L/min via nasal cannula. A chest X-ray showed bibasilar lung infiltrates. Testing revealed white blood cell count 9.0\u2009k/uL (4.0\u201310.0\u2009k/uL), hemoglobin (Hb) 15.8\u2009g/dL (13.0\u201318.0\u2009g/dL), platelets 249\u2009k/uL (150\u2013400\u2009k/uL), international normalized ratio 1.4 (\u22643.5), protime 15.1 seconds (10.0\u201312.0 seconds), partial thromboplastin time 37.4 seconds (25.0\u201335.0 seconds), blood urea nitrogen 28\u2009mg/dL (9\u201320\u2009mg/dL), creatinine 1.46\u2009mg/dL (0.66\u20131.25\u2009mg/dL), total protein 7.5\u2009g/dL (6.3\u20138.2\u2009g/dL), albumin 3.9\u2009g/dL (3.5\u20135.0\u2009g/dL), total bilirubin 1.4\u2009mg/dL (0.2\u20131.3\u2009mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 195\u2009U/L (38\u2013126\u2009U/L), alanine aminotransferase 160\u2009U/L (21\u201372\u2009U/L), and aspartate aminotransferase 243\u2009U/L (17\u201359\u2009U/L). Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen tests were negative. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed a contracted gallbladder with probable calculi and normal pancreas and spleen. He was diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia, started on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and admitted to the medical floor. He was also started on heparin 5000 U subcutaneously every 8 hours for thromboembolism prophylaxis.\n\nThe patient's shortness of breath deteriorated overnight. Chest X-ray showed worsening lung infiltrates, predominantly in the left lung. He had increased work of breathing and worsening hypoxemia requiring oxygen via high flow nasal cannula and transfer to the intensive care unit. More information was obtained from the family: his wife and father also had developed a cough and no one in the family including the patient had ever received influenza vaccination. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) respiratory viral panel on a nasopharyngeal swab sample was positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus, and therapy was started with oseltamivir.\n\nThe patient's respiratory status continued to worsen. He developed hypotension and severe abdominal pain on the third day of hospitalization. Serum amylase was 157\u2009U/L (30\u2013110\u2009U/L) and lipase 1454\u2009U/L (23\u2013300\u2009U/L). Hb decreased from 15.8 to 7.4\u2009g/dL. Coagulation parameters were normal. Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.5 (7.35\u20137.45), PaCO2 21\u2009mm Hg (35\u201345\u2009mm Hg), and PaO2 52\u2009mm Hg (80\u2013100\u2009mm Hg) on high flow nasal cannula FiO2 70% at 50\u2009L/min and the patient was subsequently intubated. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed lung consolidation of the left upper lobe and infiltrates in both lower lobes and right middle lobe, with no evidence of pulmonary embolism (Figure 1). The lateral margin of the spleen was indistinct and with low density areas, concerning for splenic injury or rupture (Figure 2). The patient denied any prior abdominal trauma.\n\nDue to these findings along with suspected ongoing hemorrhage with decreasing Hb values since admission, the patient underwent an embolization of the splenic artery by interventional radiology. Despite this procedure, Hb values continued to decrease, remaining at 7.7\u2009g/dL despite transfusion with 3 units of packed red blood cells. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy with splenectomy to control the hemorrhage. During the surgery, there was extensive hemoperitoneum and the spleen capsular surface was found to be hemorrhagic with a large laceration in the mid portion (Figure 3). Pathologic examination revealed a spleen with weight 521\u2009g and size 15\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20096\u2009cm. The capsular surface was deep red due to hemorrhage with an irregular 10\u2009cm laceration in the mid portion nearly bisecting the specimen with an intact hilar margin. There was a slightly puckered area located 5.5\u2009cm from the point of laceration with an underlying somewhat stellate area of apparent fibrous tissue with vascular proliferation consistent with a hemangioma measuring 1.5\u2009cm in greatest dimension. The splenic parenchyma was red brown. There was a large hematoma with a focal rim of tan white fibrous tissue. There was no evidence of malignancy.\n\nA bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the operating room after the splenectomy, and the culture was positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus only. Infectious mononucleosis and malaria work up were negative. The patient was continued on oseltamivir for treatment of influenza pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, was extubated successfully after 14 days of mechanical ventilatory support, and was discharged home in good condition after 40 days of hospitalization.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nWe present the case of a patient with severe influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and respiratory failure, who experienced atraumatic splenic rupture requiring emergency splenectomy to control hemorrhagic shock. While associated with other viral infections, atraumatic splenic rupture has been very rarely reported in association with influenza infection, and to our knowledge, never in the English literature as the only associated condition.\n\nIn addition to its common symptoms, some patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus infection develop severe disease, complicated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and other organ damage such as myositis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, encephalopathy, and liver function abnormalities [2]. In addition to pneumonia and respiratory failure, our patient experienced acute renal failure and transaminitis, as well as an atraumatic splenic rupture with hemorrhagic shock, requiring multiple transfusions and emergency splenectomy after a failed splenic artery embolization. Splenic rupture can be life-threatening and requires a high index of clinical suspicion and emergent intervention to prevent death. Since the spleen plays a key role in combating infection, a conservative, interventional, or spleen-preserving surgical approach should be attempted first. However, total splenectomy should be performed for patients with severe rupture, hemodynamic instability, or continued and recurrent bleeding [9].\n\nAtraumatic splenic rupture is rare. Common causes include infection, neoplasms, and vasculitis [8, 10]. One large systematic review reported 613 cases of splenic rupture without risk factors or previously diagnosed diseases [8]. Malaria, mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus infection, and typhoid fever were common infectious causes. Only 3 cases were associated with pneumonia, 2 of them caused by Legionella infection. Influenza infection was not reported in that study. Another systematic review reported 845 patients with atraumatic splenic rupture [10]; of those, 137 patients had an infectious cause, but none had influenza infection.\n\nThe precise pathologic mechanisms implicated in atraumatic splenic rupture have not been conclusively determined and probably vary from case to case. Mechanisms that have been proposed in different cases include (1) increased intra-abdominal pressure (related to coughing, sneezing, emesis, defecation, and pregnancy) leading to accumulated trauma on the splenic capsule; (2) an increase in intrasplenic tension due to cellular hyperplasia and vascular engorgement; and (3) reticular endothelial hyperplasia resulting in thrombosis and infarction, leading to hemorrhage and rupture of the splenic capsule. In addition, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and platelet dysfunction may prolong hemorrhage that would otherwise be self-limited [11, 12].\n\nIt is possible that an exaggerated immune response to influenza infection may play a role in this rare complication. The influenza A (H1N1) virus has been isolated on organ samples of the lung, brain, kidney, and spleen on animal experiments, [13] and it has also been reported that the spleen plays a particularly active role in the innate immune response to influenza A (H1N1) [14]. The precise mechanisms involved in this case are unclear, but there was a productive cough present which could have contributed to the rupture and the patient was also receiving a prophylactic dose of heparin. While a very small hemangioma was noted on histologic examination, there was no evidence of bleeding in its location.\n\nSo far, there have been at least 5 other cases reported of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza infection, none in the English literature. The first case was in Russia (former Soviet Union) in 1963 [3]. A 43\u2009y/o woman with severe influenza reported mild pain in the left upper abdomen. She was treated as an outpatient and recovered completely. One month after the symptoms started, she developed severe abdominal pain in the same area and fever 38\u00b0C. Four days later, she was admitted to the hospital with severe diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, fever 38.5\u00b0C, and unmeasurable blood pressure. On exam, she was very pale, the abdomen was distended and tender, and a fluid shift was present. She was treated for hemorrhagic shock and underwent emergency laparotomy with splenectomy. Surgical findings were an enlarged ruptured spleen and 1.5\u2009L of blood and clots in the abdominal cavity. On pathology, the spleen was congested with blood, with lymphoid hyperplasia and necrotic tissue around the rupture. The patient recovered.\n\nThe second case occurred in Poland in 1964 [4]. A 22-year-old male had influenza and related symptoms for 10 days. One day after admission, he developed severe pain in the left epigastric and lumbar regions and anemia that did not respond to transfusion. On the sixth day, the pain increased, and the patient underwent a laparotomy with splenectomy. An enlarged, necrosed spleen was noted with blood clots surrounding it and 1\u2009L of blood in the peritoneal cavity. He recovered.\n\nA third case was reported in Ukraine (former Soviet Union) in 1969 [5]. A 60-year-old woman was admitted with influenza pneumonia confirmed by antibody titers. She had severe headache, fever 38.1\u00b0C, cough, and rhinorrhea. Over the next four days, all symptoms resolved, but she then developed acute, severe pain in the epigastric area, nausea, and vomiting. Blood pressure was 80/40\u2009mm Hg, with severe tachycardia and Hb 5.2\u2009g/dL. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy for worsening shock. During the surgery, 2\u2009L of blood and clots were found in the abdominal cavity along with a ruptured spleen requiring splenectomy. On pathology of the spleen, there was significant sclerosis of the red pulp and of the stroma surrounding the follicles. Almost all vessels were significantly narrowed with thickened walls; parts of the vessel walls had necrotic changes and there was cellular debris in some follicles. The patient was discharged home 2 months later. Of note, the article references one additional case of splenic rupture with influenza authored by PM Geyler in 1963; full reference was not provided, and the report was not able to be located despite a comprehensive search.\n\nA fourth case was published in Hungary in 1979 [6]. A 57-year-old man with influenza had experienced 7 days of fever and limb pain at home and was already improving. He then developed weakness and dizziness and was admitted to the hospital. He had abdominal pain, Hb 9.9\u2009g/dL, tachycardia, and hypotension. He underwent laparotomy where a large amount of clotted blood was found in the abdominal cavity. The spleen had a transverse rupture of 1.5\u2009cm on its anterior surface, which did not penetrate the entire thickness and a splenectomy was done. On gross examination, the spleen weighed 160\u2009g and demonstrated a 3\u2009cm disruption laterally in the lower third extending 5\u20136\u2009mm into the parenchyma. On microscopy, the follicular pattern was preserved with prominent germinal centers. Areas of parenchymal hemorrhage were also noted. The histological picture was thought to be similar to changes seen in sepsis, which suggested to the authors the possibility of a viral infection as the cause.\n\nA fifth case was published in Spain in 2011 [7]. A 36-year-old man had fever 39.5\u00b0C, vomiting, diarrhea, and epigastric pain for 5 days and was admitted. On exam, he had blood pressure 95/55\u2009mm Hg and heart rate 100 beats/min. One day later, the patient had intense abdominal pain and lost consciousness when standing. His Hb was 8.9\u2009g/dL and an abdominal CT showed lung alveolar infiltrate in the bases and a splenic rupture with active hemorrhage and hemoperitoneum. A laparotomy with splenectomy was done. On pathology, the spleen was of normal size with the external surface showing some hemorrhagic areas with adherent clots that covered less than 5% of the external surface. A histologic diagnosis of capsular rupture with hemorrhagic foci over a normal spleen was made. After the urgent surgery, the patient recovered and was later diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia with a positive PCR test.\n\nThe above mentioned 5 cases, except for the last one, were reported more than 40 years ago. Reports were brief, with limited information provided including figures and diagnostic methods and with outdated terminology. They do, however, have all in common a diagnosis of splenic rupture without a history of prior trauma and an associated diagnosis of influenza, with the influenza-related symptoms preceding the abdominal signs and symptoms, anemia, and hemorrhagic shock associated with the splenic rupture.\n\nBesides the abovementioned cases, there is one reported case in the English literature of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza A (H1N1) infection. However, this case also had coinfection with Legionella pneumonia [15], which has also been associated with splenic rupture [8], so it cannot be ruled out that the splenic rupture could be due to Legionella infection instead of the influenza infection, or due to coinfection. The patient was a 42-year-old man who was hospitalized with fever of 39\u00b0C, progressive dyspnea, and nonproductive cough. On admission, he had anemia with Hb of 5\u2009g/dL and tested positive both for influenza A (H1N1) virus by PCR test on a throat swab and for Legionella by urinary antigen test and PCR in peripheral blood. Total body CT showed extensive bilateral interstitial pneumonia and signs of incipient splenic rupture. He underwent laparotomy with splenectomy. Histological examination showed diffuse splenic intravascular coagulation. The patient achieved full clinical recovery.\n\nIn conclusion, we present a very rare case of atraumatic splenic rupture associated with influenza A (H1N1) infection, which required emergency laparotomy with splenectomy to control hemorrhage after a failed splenic artery embolization. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the English literature of this complication associated with influenza infection, and only one of a handful reported previously worldwide. Clinicians should be aware of this very rare but potentially fatal complication of influenza infection, in particular in patients who develop abdominal signs and symptoms, unexplained anemia, and hemodynamic instability.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank Yelena Gerashchenko, MD, PA-C, Euriko Torrazza Perez, MD, and Susan E.

Here, we describe a case of unilateral and sudden-onset painless vision loss in an 82-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer receiving immunotherapy with the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 agent atezolizumab. Examination demonstrated a right-sided relative afferent pupillary defect, diffusely swollen optic disc, and delayed choroidal and retinal arterial filling on fundus fluorescein angiography, consistent with an arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Histology of an ipsilateral temporal artery biopsy revealed a transmural eosinophilic infiltrate without granulomas, while serology revealed the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Peripheral eosinophilia was also noted, which preceded treatment by several months. This report highlights the importance of clinician awareness of immune checkpoint inhibitors and their systemic and ophthalmic complications, which rarely appear to extend to eosinophilic temporal arteritis.\n\nTEXT:\npmcCASE PRESENTATION\n\nAn 82-year-old man of European ancestry with a history of metastatic non\u2013small cell lung adenocarcinoma presented to the emergency department of a tertiary medical centre complaining of a 1-week history of sudden-onset painless vision loss in the right eye and a 5-week history of frontal headaches and jaw claudication. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was no light perception in the right eye and 6/7.6 in the left eye. He had a right-sided relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressures were 8 and 11\u2009mm\u2009Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively. Extraocular movements were painless without a restricted range of motion. He had large, nontender temporal arteries with sluggish pulsatility to palpation. Dilated funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a pale macula with a cherry-red spot and a pale and swollen optic nerve head with obscuration of vessels predominantly at the nasal disc margin (Fig. 1A). Aside from mild hypertensive changes, the left fundus was grossly unremarkable (Fig. 1B).\n\nFIGURE 1 Unilateral optic nerve head swelling and retinal ischemia. Retinal photography of the right fundus demonstrated a swollen, pale optic nerve head, with generalized retinal ischemia evidenced by cotton wool spots and a \u201ccherry-red spot\u201d within the fovea (A). The left fundus by contrast was grossly normal (B). Optic nerve head spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging of the right eye demonstrated predominantly nasal optic nerve head swelling evident in horizontal cross-section and 3-dimensional projection (C). Left optic nerve head SD-OCT images were unremarkable (D). Horizontal cross-sectional SD-OCT imaging of the right fovea demonstrated hyperreflectivity of the inner retinal layers, characteristic of retinal ischemia (E). SD-OCT imaging of the left fovea, by comparison, was unremarkable (F). Representative fundus fluorescein angiography imaging of the right eye demonstrated profoundly delayed arterial perfusion with patchy choroidal perfusion at 0:55 minutes (G). Retinal arterial perfusion was first observed at 1:50 minutes, with venous and incomplete choroidal perfusion observed at 5:03 minutes (H). Fundus fluorescein angiography imaging of the left eye demonstrated normal arterial, venous, and choroidal perfusion at similar time points of 1:28 and 5:22 minutes following intravenous fluorescein bolus infusion (I). LE indicates left eye; RE, right eye.\n\nHis non\u2013small cell lung adenocarcinoma had been diagnosed 3 years before presentation. A lobectomy attempted at diagnosis had been aborted due to the surgical finding of miliary metastatic spread throughout the lung parenchyma. He subsequently underwent 3 cycles of palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by 12 cycles of maintenance pemetrexed. Five months before presentation, he commenced palliative immunotherapy with the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor atezolizumab. His past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus (treated with gliclazide, metformin, and dapagliflozin), hypertension (treated with amlodipine), and depression (treated with venlafaxine). Aside from bilateral cataract surgery, his past ophthalmic history was unremarkable.\n\nSpectral-domain optical coherence tomography images of the right eye demonstrated predominantly nasal optic disc swelling which was evident in horizontal cross-section and 3-dimensional projections (Fig. 1C). Ischemic changes were observed in the right macula, with the characteristic feature of hyperreflectivity of the inner retinal layers (Fig. 1E). Fundus fluorescein angiography demonstrated profound arterial perfusion delays within the retinal and choroidal circulation, with patchy choroidal perfusion at 55 seconds (normal: 10\u201315\u2009s; Fig. 1G), followed by delayed retinal arterial perfusion at 1:50 minutes (normal: 1\u20133\u2009s after dye is first seen in the choroid). Choroidal perfusion remained incomplete by 5:03 minutes (Fig. 1H). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging of the left optic nerve head and left fovea was unremarkable (Figs. 1D, F). Fluorescein angiography of the left eye demonstrated normal arterial, venous, and choroidal filling at comparable time points (Fig. 1I). These clinical findings were consistent with multivessel occlusion of the central retinal artery and the long and short posterior ciliary arteries.\n\nLaboratory investigations at presentation revealed a prolonged erythrocyte sedimentation rate [75\u2009mm/h (reference range: 1\u201335\u2009mm/h)] and an elevated C-reactive protein [65.4\u2009mg/L (reference <6\u2009mg/L)]. Computed tomography angiography of the carotid and cerebral arteries demonstrated a focus of moderate stenosis within the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery. This finding was not associated with significant hemodynamic changes within the proximal intracranial or ophthalmic arteries.\n\nA preliminary diagnosis of arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION) was made, and high-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated (3\u2009d of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by 1\u2009mg/kg oral prednisolone). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed 3 days after presentation, with histopathology demonstrating features consistent with eosinophilic temporal arteritis including an intense transmural inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of eosinophils, without distinct granulomas (Fig. 2).\n\nFIGURE 2 Eosinophilic temporal arteritis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of right temporal artery biopsy specimens at \u00d74 (A) and \u00d720 (B) magnification demonstrating transmural eosinophilic infiltrate without granulomas. The black box in (A) shows the region represented in higher magnification in (B).\n\nA retrospective review of the patient\u2019s pathology revealed persistent peripheral eosinophilia for 13 months before the presentation (Fig. 3). Autoimmune serology revealed an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:2560 (speckled and nucleolar) and the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (intermediate pattern) with an anti\u2013proteinase-3 antibody titer of 7\u2009IU/mL (reference \u22645\u2009IU/mL).\n\nFIGURE 3 Peripheral eosinophilia predating atezolizumab therapy. Peripheral eosinophilia had been evident for a period of 9 months before commencing of atezolizumab therapy. Before 2019, and in the context of chemotherapy, peripheral eosinophil concentrations were within the normal range. Elevated levels were observed after completion of pemetrexed therapy, and during atezolizumab therapy (A). Normal range eosinophils were subsequently seen in the context of corticosteroid therapy (B). NSCLC indicates non\u2013small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe diagnosis was revised to an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\u2013positive eosinophilic vasculitis affecting temporal arteries. Following a multidisciplinary case review, atezolizumab was discontinued, and he was commenced on 10\u2009mg oral methotrexate weekly in addition to 1\u2009mg/kg oral prednisolone. Furthermore, the patient was commenced on trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for pulmonary pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis and omeprazole for gastric ulcer prophylaxis. Three weeks later, he presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and fever. He was diagnosed with pneumonia which was managed palliatively. He died 2 days later.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe describe a case of sudden-onset vision loss in a man undergoing treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) atezolizumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor), associated with an eosinophilic temporal arteritis and a unilateral AAION. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide histopathologic evidence of eosinophilic vasculitis occurring in the context of ICI therapy. In addition, this is the first documented case of an AAION in a patient undergoing anti-PD-L1 therapy.\n\nICIs are a novel class of monoclonal antibodies used for the treatment of cancer. Collectively, these drugs function by stimulating antitumor immunity through the disinhibition of T cells via cell surface proteins including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), PD-L1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Though these drugs are typically second or third-line therapeutics for the treatment of various metastatic diseases, their use has revolutionized cancer medicine.1\n\nThese therapies have been recognized to result in various immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Accordingly, there is a need for vigilant pharmacosurveillance to determine the nature and frequency of adverse events. As a presumed consequence of T-cell disinhibition, ICIs appear to upregulate various autoimmune processes. The mechanisms by which these processes occur, however, remain to be elucidated.2,3 Evidence suggests that 20%\u201359% of patients undergoing immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 inhibitors experience 1 or more irAEs.4 The most commonly affected sites are the endocrine, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal systems. PD-L1 inhibitors have been associated with a slightly lower incidence of irAEs than PD-1 inhibitors, potentially due to the fact that PD-1 inhibition prevents engagement of both PD-L1 and PD-L2 with PD-1, while PD-L1 inhibition prevents only the engagement of PD-L1 with PD-1.4\n\nThough ICI-associated vasculitis is uncommon, it appears to predominantly affect large vessels, resulting in large vessel vasculitis including giant cell arteritis, aortitis, and primary angiitis of the nervous system.3,5 Most cases of ICI-associated vasculitis have been reported with PD-1 or CTLA-4 inhibitor therapy.6 AAION is a consequence of vessel wall inflammation resulting in occlusion of arteries supplying the eye. The most common cause of AAION is giant cell arteritis. Eosinophilic vasculitis by contrast, is a rare cause of AAION.7 We are aware of 6 cases of AAION reported in the context of ICI therapy, each of which involved either a CTLA-4 inhibitor or a PD-1 inhibitor.6,8 A single case of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis has been reported previously in a patient undergoing PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. Unfortunately, this association was confounded by concurrent anti-CTLA-4 therapy, and no histopathologic specimens were available to confirm the presence of vasculitis.5\n\nA salient feature of the current case is the retrospective observation of peripheral eosinophilia preceding initiation of therapy by at least 9 months (Fig. 3). Eosinophilia has been observed in cancer patients treated with ICIs9 and is thought by some to be a biomarker of treatment success.10 The PD-1 pathway is intimately involved in the regulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in which it acts as a metabolic checkpoint; activated ILC2s secrete high amounts of Th2 cytokines including interleukin 5, a specific and potent activator of eosinophils. PD-1 agonism ameliorates ILC2 activation. While formal cytokine studies were not undertaken in this patient, it is conceivable that activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by atezolizumab led to ILC2 (and thus interleukin 5) mediated eosinophil activation, the scene being set for this with his background eosinophilia. Eosinophilia is not a current contraindication to PD-L1 therapy. We do, however, question its pathoetiological relevance in a patient who subsequently developed an eosinophilic vasculitis after commencing ICI therapy.\n\nThis study highlights a unique presentation of vision loss resulting from an AAION associated with eosinophilic temporal arteritis in a patient undergoing treatment with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab. Although this appears to be the first reported case of eosinophilic temporal arteritis associated with ICI therapy, it is unclear if this therapy was a precipitant since eosinophilia predated the commencement of treatment. Nonetheless, with the increasing use of these therapies, and concomitant increase in the number of irAEs, physicians and ophthalmologists alike should be aware of the association and its potential severe visual consequences.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors thank Angela Chappell and Carly Emerson (Flinders Medical Centre) for ophthalmic images.\n\nConflicts of Interest/Financial Disclosures\n\nNone reported.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nEosinophilic pneumonia: a case of daptomycin induced lung injury.\n\nABSTRACT:\nEosinophilic pneumonia is a category of lung diseases characterized by an increased number of eosinophils in alveolar spaces and interstitium. Acute cases are often caused by fungal infections, parasites, drugs or toxins and can present with respiratory failure. Daptomycin has been identified as one of the rare causes of acute eosinophilic pneumonia. We describe a case of an elderly man on daptomycin for MRSA endocarditis treatment who presented to the hospital with fevers and dyspnea within two weeks of daptomycin initiation. As an inpatient, he developed an increasing oxygen requirement necessitating intensive care unit management. Daptomycin cessation improved his symptoms and he was placed on a steroid taper. These findings suggested a diagnosis of daptomycin-induced eosinophilic pneumonia. However, the patient deteriorated and eventually passed away despite resuscitative efforts. This case highlights the importance of prompt identification of eosinophilic pneumonia, its potential severity and the need for more exploration regarding the timing of corticosteroid taper. This in turn will inform more effective approaches to this condition in the future.\n\nTEXT:\n1. Introduction\n\nEosinophilic pneumonia is a category of lung diseases characterized by eosinophil infiltration of alveolar spaces and lung interstitium[1]. Acute cases are rare and thus the epidemiology is not well understood [2,3]. In addition, there are numerous causes of eosinophilic pneumonia including fungal infection, parasites, drugs and toxins [1,2,4]. A few studies have identified daptomycin as a cause of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) [4\u20137, 11].\n\nDaptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that is FDA approved for use in the treatment of skin and bloodstream infections [5,8]. It exhibits bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) [4,8]. One of the most common adverse effects associated with daptomycin is skeletal myopathy characterized by an increase in creatinine kinase [9]. However, daptomycin has also been identified as a rare cause of eosinophilic pneumonia.\n\nWe describe a case of an elderly man on daptomycin for MRSA endocarditis treatment who presented to the hospital with fevers and dyspnea within 2\u00a0weeks of initiation. The purpose of this paper is to provide more data about this clinical disease as well as highlight potential variations in presentation and management.\n\n2. Case presentation\n\nA 71-year-old African American man with a history of obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and undergoing treatment with 800 mg IV daptomycin (completed two of six weeks of treatment) for aortic valve MRSA endocarditis presented from subacute rehab after nursing staff noted his acute dyspnea for one day. In the emergency department, his oxygen saturation was 83% on room air. The rest of his vital signs were normal. Aside from some increased work of breathing and diffuse rhonchi on lung exam, his physical examination was non-focal and unremarkable. Initial laboratory exam revealed leukocytosis of 15.3k with 0.4% immature granulocytes, making the white count more likely secondary to stress than infection. Besides, eosinophils were as high as 6.3%. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count and complete metabolic panel were unremarkable. An arterial blood gas analysis on room air reflected a primary respiratory alkalosis (ABG: pH 7.52, PaCO2 31, PO2\u00a080, HCO3 25, SaO2 98). His chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (Figure 1). CT chest without contrast confirmed the presence of bilateral patchy airspace disease and ground-glass infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or inflammatory lung disease but not typical of classic congestive heart failure (Figures 2 and 3). It was noted that in his prior diagnosis of MRSA endocarditis, the patient was discharged on only Daptomycin. With these data, the initial working diagnosis was between an atypical pneumonia and an inflammatory process perhaps from daptomycin toxicity. Infectious disease was consulted who also suspected daptomycin induced lung injury thus, daptomycin was stopped. He received non-invasive ventilation and ceftaroline for pneumonia and endocarditis.Figure 1. Erect anteroposterior (AP) chest x-ray taken with a portable (port) x-ray machine upon admission to the emergency department showing bilateral alveolar infiltrates and diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities. R = right side\n\nFigure 2. Axial section CT non-enhanced (lung window), section 60, obtained in the emergency department demonstrating ground glass infiltration. L = Left side, A = anterior, P = posterior, scale = 1cm. Figure 1\n\nFigure 3. Axial section CT non-enhanced (lung window), section 55, obtained in the emergency department demonstrating further ground glass infiltration. L = Left side, A = anterior, P = posterior, scale = 1cm\n\nShortly after admission, his oxygenation remained poor despite escalating oxygen support (high flow oxygen 50\u00a0L, 80% then BiPAP 18/10 with FiO2 100%), he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for impending intubation. The next day, recognizing that his pulmonary status was tenuous and rationalizing that this was likely secondary to inflammation, the primary care team started him on methylprednisolone 60 mg q6h. After this, his respiratory rate slowed from 30 to 16\u201320 breaths per minute. His oxygen requirement decreased and his work of breathing improved.\n\nOver the next 2\u00a0days, he was on lower ventilatory support (BiPAP 16/10 with FiO2 down to 0.6) and his oxygen saturations were 99% allowing his transition to a high-flow system. His chest x-ray showed >75% clearing of infiltrate compared to the initial film (Figure 4). His clinical improvement in the absence of daptomycin and the presence of high-dose corticosteroid supported the hypothesis that his pulmonary process was driven by an inflammatory response likely due to the daptomycin.Figure 4. Erect anteroposterior (AP) chest x-ray taken with a portable (port) x-ray machine one day after daptomycin was discontinued showing decreased bilateral alveolar infiltrates compared to Figure 1. L = left side\n\nAfter five days in the ICU, the patient was transitioned to nasal cannula, planned for a 20-day prednisone taper from 40 mg and transferred to a step-down unit. Unfortunately, his improvement was short-lived, and his oxygen need increased again requiring BiPAP (70\u00a0L, 90%) by day 10 in the hospital. He was given a dose of methylprednisolone 60 mg IV and transferred back to the ICU. At this point in his hospitalization, the working diagnosis was either an ongoing partially treated drug-induced lung injury on a lower steroid dose or an alternative steroid-responsive process such as vasculitis or non-vasculitis inflammatory lung disease. Of note, sputum cultures were ordered but never obtained throughout his hospitalization because he never produced an adequate amount of sputum He was placed on methylprednisolone 60 mg IV daily and immunological workup including ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith antibody, anti-histone antibody, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, anti-GBM antibody, RF, anti-CCP were sent which were all normal. He developed respiratory failure. Unfortunately, during intubation, the patient developed a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to hypoxia with a return of spontaneous circulation in 10\u00a0minutes. He suffered three more PEA arrests which are thought to be secondary to severe hypoxic hypercapnic respiratory failure and metabolic acidosis. After the 4th arrest, he was pronounced dead.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nThis paper highlights a case of daptomycin-induced eosinophilic pneumonia (DAP-Induced EP) in a 71-year-old male. Eosinophilic pneumonia can be further subdivided into primary or secondary disorders, where a primary is typically idiopathic and secondary is due to the presence of an identifiable cause [1]. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a secondary disorder that can be caused by drugs, toxins, parasites and fungal infections [1,2,4]. In particular, drug-induced AEP has been reported to be associated with the use of daptomycin, mesalamine, sulfasalazine and minocycline. However, this condition is quite rare and thus the epidemiology is poorly understood. One large-scale literature review exploring drug-induced AEP found 228 cases reported between 1990 and 2017, with only 137 cases meeting their inclusion criteria. The demographics for these cases ranged from 18 to 82\u00a0years of age and affected males and females equally. Of these patients, 21% had an acute hypoxemic respiratory failure of which 19.8% required mechanical ventilation thus highlighting the severity of this condition. This study also found that daptomycin use accounted for one of the highest numbers of drug-induced AEP cases which emphasizes the need for a better understanding of this correlation [10,11].\n\nTo effectively assess this condition, it is important to understand the pathophysiology. One study proposed that the detection of antigens by alveolar macrophages leads to the recruitment of T-helper 2 lymphocytes and the release of interleukin 5. The function of interleukin 5 is to induce the production of eosinophils and migration to the lung. Eotaxin, an eosinophil chemoattractant, is produced by alveolar macrophages and other cells in the lungs. This substance further induces an accumulation of eosinophils. It is hypothesized that daptomycin is retained in the pulmonary surfactant and when concentrations become high enough, it can lead to injury of the surrounding tissues. This injury will then activate alveolar macrophages and initiate the process of eosinophil accumulation [12].\n\nAcute cases of eosinophilic pneumonia often present with a rapid onset of dyspnea, non-productive cough and fever [2,13]. On physical exam, patients present with tachypnea, diffuse inspiratory crackles and rhonchi [2]. Imaging of AEP usually shows bilateral reticular ground-glass opacities that spread as the disease progresses [10]. In addition, patients with eosinophilic pneumonia present with eosinophilia in the blood (eosinophilic count >500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 cells/L) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (>5% eosinophils in white blood cell differential count) [10]. Disease severity can vary from a mild disease to severe respiratory failure [13] however factors related to increased severity are poorly understood.\n\nThe diagnosis of daptomycin-induced eosinophilic pneumonia is typically made after meeting several proposed criteria including concurrent exposure to daptomycin, fever, dyspnea with increased oxygen requirement or requirement of mechanical ventilation, new infiltrates on chest x-ray or CT scan, bronchoalveolar lavage with >25% eosinophils and improvement after daptomycin withdrawal [5,6]. Higashi et al. (2018) also explored whether skin testing could be useful in detecting a potential risk of developing daptomycin-induced eosinophilic pneumonia. However, they found no correlation between a positive skin test and susceptibility to developing DAP-induced EP [4]. Our patient met all but one of the above criteria as a bronchoalveolar lavage was not done after considering the risks and benefits. For their literature review, Kim et al. (2012) created inclusion criteria to diagnose DAP-induced EP as definite, probable, possible or unlikely[6]. Using that criteria, our patient falls under probable DAP-induced EP due to the presence of peripheral eosinophilia.\n\nCurrent treatments of DAP-induced EP include removal of daptomycin and treatment with corticosteroids. Uppal et al. (2016) looked at 35 cases of DAP-induced EP and found that a majority of these cases showed improvement or recovery after the removal of daptomycin and subsequent corticosteroid treatment. More specifically, patients typically saw improvement one to seven days after daptomycin removal [7]. In the case of our patient, the improvement was seen 24\u00a0h after the removal of daptomycin and continued to improve until day 10 when the patient began having an increased oxygen requirement. Thus, it is important to closely review this case and reflect upon what improvements could have been made to allow for a more favorable outcome. Despite the benefit of corticosteroid treatment in AEP patients, one case did show recurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia following steroid taper after which the patient required low dose steroid treatment for 2\u00a0years [7,14]. Unfortunately, due to the rarity of this disease, there is no well-established guideline for corticosteroid treatment in DAP-induced EP. However, the typical regimen employed in other patients includes IV methylprednisolone 60\u2013125 mg every six hours with conversion to PO prednisone 40\u201360 mg daily and taper over two to six weeks [7]. Our patient was given IV methylprednisolone and was planned for a two-week prednisone taper. However, perhaps a longer taper would have been more beneficial given the patient\u2019s age and severity of respiratory failure as indicated by oxygen requirement. Future studies could explore the recommended prednisone taper based on the severity of the patient\u2019s case.\n\nDue to the rarity of drug-induced EP, many aspects of it are poorly understood. As mentioned previously, many patients do show improvement or recovery after treatment [7]. However, no studies have looked at the long-term impacts and thus, there is a poor understanding of the potential complications of this condition. More research on this subject could inform more holistic approaches to treatment and allow for better patient outcomes in the long term.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis study highlights the importance of prompt identification of eosinophilic pneumonia. Based on the literature, this disease is quite severe due to the potential for the development of acute respiratory failure. However, research has shown that removal of the offending agent and appropriate treatment with corticosteroids can lead to recovery [6,7]. Thus, a set of diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic pneumonia should be established to help lead to a prompt diagnosis. Future research can explore potential risk factors and complications associated with drug-induced AEP. Finally, a thorough exploration of corticosteroid treatment variations can inform more effective approaches to this condition in the future.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nNo acknowledgments.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in this article are our own and not an official position of the institution.\n\nDisclosure statement\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\nCorrection Statement\n\nThis article has been republished with minor changes.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nHemorrhagic Cholecystitis: A Rare Cause of Melena.\n\nABSTRACT:\nHemorrhagic cholecystitis -- a rare cause of hemobilia and melena -- is an atypical presentation of calculous cholecystitis, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A 75-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, who was undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy, presented with symptoms of acute cholecystitis. Two days later, she developed melena and symptoms of obstructive jaundice. Following radiological evaluation, a diagnosis of hemorrhagic cholecystitis was made. The patient was managed conservatively with IV antibiotics and blood transfusion in the initial period (clopidogrel was withheld); an interval cholecystectomy was performed six weeks later. Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare complication of acute cholecystitis, and its diagnosis is challenging as it mimics various other hepatopancreaticobiliary diseases. Management options include early surgery or conservative management at the initial stage, followed by interval cholecystectomy.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nHemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare cause of hemobilia and melena\u00a0[1]. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to delay in its diagnosis. Bleeding into the gallbladder could result from various causes, and the typical presentation of this rare problem only occurs in less than 25% of patients\u00a0[2]. Therefore, diagnosing hemorrhagic cholecystitis is challenging, as it is often confused with the more common clinical diagnosis of acute cholecystitis\u00a0[3]. There is no comprehensive study on the management of patients with hemorrhagic cholecystitis, and only case reports and series are available; no specific treatment guidelines exist. Here, we report a case of acute calculous hemorrhagic cholecystitis with melena. The patient had a rare presentation, and thus, her management differed from those reported in most available case reports.\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 75-year-old woman presented with a two-day history of fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She had a history of diabetes and hypertension and had suffered a myocardial infarction four months prior, for which she was receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg). On clinical examination, the patient was febrile, with a heart rate of 88 beats/min and blood pressure of 140/100 mmHg. There was tenderness on the right side of her abdomen, with a positive Murphy's sign. There were no palpable masses in the abdomen.\n\nOne day later, she developed yellowish discoloration of the sclera and melena. Her hemoglobin level was 7.1 g/dL. Other investigations revealed biochemical features of obstructive jaundice (alkaline phosphatase 517 U/L, bilirubin 156.6 \u00b5mol/L, direct bilirubin 152.4 \u00b5mol/L). Inflammatory marker levels were high (white cell count 16.3 \u00d7 109/L, C-reactive protein 61.3 mg/L), and INR was 1.4. She had no history of abdominal trauma or bleeding diathesis.\n\nTransabdominal ultrasonography (USG) revealed an avascular material of mixed echogenicity, in a distended gallbladder (Figure\u00a01). Sonographic Murphy\u2019s sign was positive. Non-contrast and IV contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a heterogeneous material, with a density almost equal to that of blood, filling the entire distended gall bladder, with no significant contrast enhancement in the arterial/venous phases (Figure\u00a02). In addition, CT revealed a small gall stone. There was no biliary dilatation or active arterial bleeding in the biliary system. The patient was diagnosed with hemorrhagic cholecystitis.\n\nFigure 1 Transabodimal USG of the gallbladder.\n\nMixed echogenic materials and non-acoustic shadowing\n\nUSG,\u00a0ultrasonography\n\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2 Axial cut of an abdominal CT with contrast.\n\nHeterogeneous material with a density almost equal to that of blood filling the entire distended gall bladder, with no significant contrast enhancement\n\nOn the day of admission, intravenous cefuroxime and metronidazole were initiated. On day 1, clopidogrel was withheld after the cardiologist\u2019s opinion, and two pints of blood were transfused. On day 3, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract and a significant amount of bile in the duodenum. We arranged a multidisciplinary meeting with her physician and cardiologist and decided to continue conservative management unless her condition deteriorated. She responded well to antibiotics, and the melena resolved spontaneously on day 5 of admission. She was discharged after a week of conservative management and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 6 weeks later. The gallbladder wall was thickened and showed some intramural thrombi with a single calculi (Figure 3). The patient had an uneventful postoperative period.\n\nFigure 3 Gross specimen of the gallbladder.\n\nThickened wall shows some residual intraluminal clots with a single calculus indicated by the white arrow\n\nThe histology of the gallbladder revealed features of acute on chronic cholecystitis with neither dysplasia nor malignancy. No complications were reported during the follow-up period of six months.\n\nAs it is a case report and it is not a clinical study or research, ethical approval was exempted. The patient was managed as it is, and no intervention was done for the publication. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBleeding into the biliary tract, first described in 1945 by Sandblom, is caused by trauma\u00a0[4]. Shah and Clegg first published about hemobilia due to hemorrhagic cholecystitis in 1979\u00a0[5]. Blood in the gall bladder lumen can be due to trauma, liver biopsy, hepatobiliary instrumentation, biliary tumor, parasite manifestation, aneurysm rupture into the biliary ducts, anticoagulation, or bleeding diathesis (renal failure and cirrhosis)\u00a0[2, 6-7].\n\nIn hemorrhagic cholecystitis, inflammation occurs along the gallbladder wall, leading to mucosal injury and bleeding into the gallbladder lumen\u00a0[7]. It commonly occurs in patients using antiplatelet (aspirin, cilostazol), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and steroidal drugs\u00a0[8-10]. The literature shows that both calculous and acalculous cholecystitis can lead to hemorrhagic cholecystitis\u00a0[11-12]. Cases of hemorrhagic cholecystitis present in many ways. Sometimes, the gallbladder distends with blood and perforates into the peritoneal cavity, leading to peritonitis, whereas at other times, blood clots may enter the common bile duct and cause obstructive jaundice; moreover, blood may enter the gastrointestinal tract and present as hematemesis or melena (hemobilia)\u00a0[1].\n\nHemobilia is a rare presentation of hemorrhagic cholecystitis. Although upper abdominal pain, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and jaundice (Quinke's triad) are typical characteristics of hemobilia, only 22% of cases have these features\u00a0[2, 13]. Moreover, patients may have a fever with leukocytosis, and a positive Murphy\u2019s sign\u00a0[14]. Our patient presented with typical features of hemorrhagic cholecystitis. Blood entered the gastrointestinal tract and the patient had melena.\n\nAbdominal USG is the primary investigation in patients with acute cholecystitis. However, its usefulness in hemorrhagic cholecystitis is questionable. Therefore, diagnosis is made by contrast-enhanced CT. Typical CT findings include thickening of the gallbladder wall, distended gallbladder, and heterogeneous high-attenuation material within its lumen\u00a0[15-16]. Extravasation of contrast material may be evident in the arterial phase of CT in actively bleeding patients\u00a0[7]. In addition, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is helpful in assessing hemobilia in some patients\u00a0[17].\n\nAccording to the literature review of case reports, cholecystectomy is the gold standard treatment for hemorrhagic cholecystitis, and cholecystostomy is suitable in hemodynamically unstable and frail patients\u00a0[18]. A retrospective analysis by Kim and Kim revealed that ERCP also plays a role in the initial management of biliary obstruction by removing blood clots from the common bile duct. Biliary drainage improves the condition in most cases\u00a0[17]. However, this condition might be complicated by gallbladder perforation, thereby increasing morbidity and mortality\u00a0[18]. Our patient was initially managed conservatively by withholding clopidogrel, administering IV antibiotics, and resuscitation with blood and IV fluids.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn a patient with melena and a typical presentation of hemobilia, hemorrhagic cholecystitis, although rare, should be considered as a differential diagnosis to avoid life-threatening complications. Early diagnosis with clinical and radiological assessment can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. Although most patients with hemorrhagic cholecystitis can be treated with early cholecystectomy or ERCP, a few hemodynamically stable patients with no active bleeding can be managed conservatively in the initial stage, followed by interval cholecystectomy in six weeks.\n\nHuman Ethics\n\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

The first line therapeutic agents, ganciclovir (GCV) and its oral prodrug valganciclovir (VGCV), inhibit CMV replication by targeting the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. However, haematological side effects limit its therapeutic potential in 10\u201320% of the cases. Furthermore, genetic mutations of UL97 and UL54, conferring antiviral resistance, were reported, especially in cases of prolonged antiviral therapy, lack of prior CMV immunity in transplant patients and strong immunosuppression [2].\n\nIn cases of clinical or virological treatment failure, guidelines recommend the escalation of valganciclovir dose or escalating to cidofovir or foscarnet [1]. Both options are often limited by the toxic profile. Furthermore, cross-resistances were reported [2]. Hence, novel drugs that target alternative viral mechanisms are urgently required. Recently, letermovir, a new antiviral compound, was approved for the prophylaxis of CMV disease in bone-marrow transplant recipients [3]. Letermovir inhibits the terminase complex, which is essential for viral replication, for cleavage and packaging of large concatemers of CMV-DNA [4].\n\nAccording to its licence, letermovir was mainly used as a prophylaxis agent for CMV infections. However, its different mechanism of action as well as its excellent side effect profile made it an appealing off-label option for the therapy of GCV resistant CMV infections, as well was for patients who reported severe leukopenia or reduced kidney function. However, data are limited to case series [5\u20137].\n\nIn the present report we document a case series of patients who have received letermovir for the compassionate use for CMV infections, highlighting its antiviral potential, but also pointing out possible difficulties, thus judging its efficacy in the clinical setting.\n\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects and data collection\nThe present retrospective single-centre study exclusively comprises patients suffering from CMV infections who received letermovir for the compassionate use for treatment of CMV infections. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria (ECS 2013/2019), and all study-related procedures were conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki. We included adult patients who got diagnosed with CMV infection, defined as CMV DNA copy levels >\u2009200\u00a0IU/ml measured in plasma and were treated with letermovir due to ganciclovir refractory or resistant CMV viremia or patients who were intolerant to receive ganciclovir or foscarnet. Intolerance to receive ganciclovir or foscarnet was decided by the responsible team of clinicians.\n\nThe same dosage of LMV was used for treatment as for prophylaxis of CMV infection\u2014480\u00a0mg qd or 240\u00a0mg if on concomitant cyclosporin [3]. As suggested in the international consensus guidelines, CMV infection was separated into three groups: asymptomatic infections, viral syndrome, or tissue invasive (\u201cend organ\u201d) disease [1]. CMV syndrome and tissue invasive disease were diagnosed according to Ljungman et al. [8]. Treatment was monitored closely, and patients were regularly controlled for adverse events or development of viral syndrome or tissue invasion. Baseline demographics, CMV associated symptoms, previously received CMV prophylaxis or therapy, viral kinetics, ongoing immunosuppression and clinical outcome were retrospectively collected. Clinical response was defined as a decline of viral load to <\u2009200\u00a0IU/ml. Furthermore, viral half-life was calculated, according to the formula t1/2\u2009=\u2009\u2212ln2/slope [9]. Patients who achieved the endpoint were further controlled for reactivation of CMV.\n\nResults\nA total of 11 patients were identified who received letermovir for the compassionate use for CMV infection. One patient had to be excluded as the exact time of termination of treatment was not documented. Another patient was excluded as she was already discussed in an earlier case report, which has not yet been published. The other nine patients are discussed below. Table 1 gives an overview of the demographic characteristics. The median age was 66\u00a0years (45\u201370), and 77.8% of the patients was male. Five patients were solid organ transplant recipients (55.6%), two developed CMV infection after HSCT (22.2%), one patient suffered from TARFO syndrome (11.1%) and one patient suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (11.1%). Six patients experienced asymptomatic CMV viremia (66.7%), one CMV syndrome (11%), one a probable CMV pneumonia (11%) and one patient with probable CMV enteritis (11%) [8]. Clinical reasoning for compassionate use of letermovir was as follows: confirmed antiviral resistance against GCV (n\u2009=\u20092, 22.2%), virological treatment failure of GCV (n\u2009=\u20091, 11.1%) and HSCT associated with significant CMV viremia (n\u2009=\u20092, 22.2%). In the other four patients, the clinicians opted for letermovir instead of ganciclovir or foscarnet, to prevent aggravation of coexisting diseases. In three of the patients severe leukopenia and concomitant infection (two of them septic) were the reasons for letermovir selection. Finally, one patient (11.1%) suffering from a multicentric form of Castleman disease called TAFRO syndrome (an acronym for thrombocytopenia, anasarca, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction and organomegaly), experienced CMV reactivation under therapy with high-dose cortisone and tocilizumab. To prevent further aggravation thrombocytopenia, which would have ultimately led to discontinuation of tocilizumab, clinicians decided for compassionate use of letermovir instead of valganciclovir.Table 1 Characteristics of the patients treated with letermovir\n\nPatients\tDemographics\tImmuno-suppression\tPresentation of CMV\tPrevious antivirals\tIndication for LMV\tDaily dose of LMV (mg)\tAdaption of immuno-suppression\tInitial CMV DNA IU/ml\tTime to suppression of virus replication (days)\tRecurrence of CMV infection\t\nPatient 1\tf, 69a, kidney transplantation\tMMF, TAC and cortisone\tAsymptomatic\tVGCV\tLeukopenia and GCV refractory viremia\t480\tMMF stopped\t833\t8\tNo\t\nPatient 2\tm, 60a, HSCT\tMMF, CsA and cortisone\tAsymptomatic\tNone\tPrevent aggravation of leuko- and thrombocytopenia after HSCT\t240\tMMF paused\t261\t14\tYes\t\nPatient 3\tm, 70a, heart transplantation\tMMF, TAC and cortisone\tProbable pneumonia\tGCV1\tLeukopenia under GCV and sepsis\t480\tMMF paused\t898\tNot achieved\t\t\nPatient 4\tm, 58a, heart transplantation\tMMF, TAC and cortisone\tAsymptomatic\tVGCV\tConfirmed resistance\t480\tNone\t39,600\t1852\tNo\t\nPatient 5\tm, 74a, kidney transplantation\tMMF and TAC\tCMV syndrome\tVGCV\tConfirmed resistance\t480\tMMF paused\t2770\t34\tBo\t\nPatient 6\tm, 45a, TARFO-syndrome\ttocilizumab and cortisone\tAsymptomatic\tNone\tPrevent aggravation of thrombocytopenia under tocilizumab\t480\tNone\t1610\t23\tNo\t\nPatient 7\tm, 68a, kidney transplantation\tMMF, TAC and cortisone\tAsymptomatic\tNone\tLeukopenia and sepsis\t480\tMMF dose reduction\t1550\t29\tNo\t\nPatient 8\tf, 65a, SLE\tMMF and cortisone\tProbable enteritis\tNone\tPrevent aggravation of leukopenia\t480\tNone\t16,000\t83\tNo\t\nPatient 9\tm, 61a, HSCT\tMMF and CsA\tAsymptomatic\tNone\tPrevent aggravation of leuko- and thrombocytopenia after HSCT\t240\tNone\t224\t23\tNo\t\nf female, m male, a age, HSCT haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, SLE systemic lupus erythematosus, MMF mycophenolate mofetil, TAC tacrolimus, CsA cyclosporine A, LMV letermovir, VGCV valganciclovir, GCV ganciclovir\n\n1CMV IgG co-administration\n\n2In patient 4 letermovir treatment was prematurely discontinued at CMV DNA load 739\u00a0IU/ml, and later on re-administered. Although treatment course was prolonged (185\u00a0days) no signs of CMV end-organ disease were reported\n\n\n\nInitiation of letermovir treatment yielded a viral response, after an initial viral load increase, in 7 out of 9 patients (77.8%). The median duration of letermovir treatment was 31 (8\u2013127) days. The median duration to achieve a decrease of viral load <\u2009200\u00a0IU/ml was 23 (8\u201383) days. Viral kinetic curves are shown in Fig.\u00a01. In the other two patients (patients 3 and 4), treatment was discontinued prematurely at CMV DNA copy levels >\u2009200\u00a0IU/ml, at 211\u00a0IU/ml and 739\u00a0IU/ml respectively. Both patients experienced an increase of viral load within the next month, and letermovir was re-administered. After re-administration, patient 4 experienced a slow but steady decrease of viral load, resulting in CMV DNA copies <\u2009200\u00a0IU/ml within a total of 185\u00a0days of treatment. Re-administration of letermovir in patient 3 yielded a decrease of CMV copy load, but general estate of the patient further aggravated and the patient developed sepsis. In a discussion with the family treatment discontinuation was decided and the patient died within the following days. End-organ disease occurred in none of the asymptomatic CMV patients under letermovir treatment, but one patient (patient 2) experienced a CMV end-organ disease only 2\u00a0weeks after treatment discontinuation. The episode was subsequently treated with VGCV, as leukopenia had improved.Fig. 1 Relative change of CMV DNA copies in percent after initiation of letermovir treatment. The average increase was 2.7-fold (SD\u2009=\u20091.3). Final descent, defined by the definite negative movement, was seen as late as day 30 (mean\u2009=\u20098.7, SD\u2009=\u20098.8)\n\n\n\nThe initiation of letermovir therapy was associated with an initial increase of viral load in 7 out of 9 (77.8%) patients. The average increase was 2.7-fold (SD\u2009=\u20091.3) of the viral load at start of treatment. Final descent, defined by the definite negative movement, was seen as late as day 30 (median\u2009=\u20096, range [3\u201330]). The viral half-life was 7.1 (1.49\u20139.1) days.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present report demonstrates the potential of letermovir for the effective treatment of CMV infections. All present patients received letermovir as a monotherapy. The therapy was generally well tolerated, and no adverse events were reported. Treatment initiation yielded a decrease of viral load to <\u2009200 copies/ml in 88.9% of the patients. However, one patient with complete clinical response experienced CMV end-organ disease within 2\u00a0weeks after treatment discontinuation. Immunosuppression was adapted in all SOT patients, by either dose reduction or pausing of cell-cycle inhibitor.\n\nTherapeutic strategies for clinical or virological failure of CMV infections include the escalation of valganciclovir dose or switching to cidofovir or foscarnet [1]. However, both drugs are associated with the potential for severe adverse events, such as nephrotoxicity and myelosuppression, which limit their therapeutic usefulness. Letermovir, a novel inhibitor of the terminase complex, was recently approved for the prophylaxis of CMV infection in allogenic HSCT, but is not yet approved for pre-emptive therapy [3]. Its favourable side effect profile has led to an increased off-label use for GCV-resistant CMV infections or if the patients were intolerant to receive other treatment options. However, first observations of letermovir resistance have been reported [10\u201313]. A recently published letermovir resistance analysis among HSCT recipients receiving letermovir prophylaxis identified all letermovir resistance associated variants within the UL 56 gene [13]. Although some treatment durations were prolonged, no viremia breakthrough was reported in our cohort.\n\nDosing of letermovir for preemptive therapy remains uncertain, as there is no approval for letermovir in this indication. Stoelben et al. successfully used lower letermovir doses of 40 bid or 80 qd for preemptive therapy in kidney transplant recipients, whereas Turner et al. used higher doses of up to 960\u00a0mg qd for the salvage therapy of drug-resistant CMV retinitis without an emergence of adverse events [6, 14]. Letermovir dose in our cohort coincided with the dose recommendations for the prophylaxis of CMV infection, 480\u00a0mg qd or 240\u00a0mg if on concomitant cyclosporin [3]. The same treatment protocol was recently chosen by Phoompoung et al. for the salvage therapy of CMV infections in transplant recipients [7].\n\nThe average duration until decrease of viral load to under <\u2009200\u00a0mg/ml was 32.9\u00a0days. The viral half-life time under letermovir was 6.3\u00a0days, which is longer than previously published viral half-lives of solid-organ transplant patients treated with GCV [9]. As demonstrated in earlier reports, the viral load initially increases after therapy start. The average increase in our cohort was 2.7-fold of the viral load at treatment start. However, the increase in viral load was not associated with an increase in symptoms. This may be explicable by the mode of action of letermovir, as viral replication is blocked at a late stage, possibly yielding high intracellular titre of viral DNA in absence of a viable virus. This emphasizes the need for alternative methods to estimate the risk of CMV disease under letermovir treatment.\n\nThe present study has some limitations. As a result of the retrospective study design, the included cohort is heterogenous, leading to a broad spectrum of indication for letermovir. However, precisely this highlights the clinicians\u2019 desire for alternative treatment options, as existing first-line therapies are often limited by their severe side effect profile, especially in patients with concomitant bacterial infections. Further, we could not exclude that the patient\u2019s immune status contributed significantly to the treatment outcome, especially in patients with long lasting viremia.\n\nHence, prospective trials evaluating efficacy, safety, drug dosing, treatment duration and emergence of drug resistance are urgently required.\n\nPublisher\u2019s note\n\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\nThe authors thank the members of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical University Vienna, for their help.\n\nAuthor contribution\nAll authors contributed to the study conception and design.

Its etiology is unknown; however, it may be associated with other systemic autoimmune diseases, malignancy, and rarely with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. RP has a variable pattern at presentation and may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fever and arthralgia, in addition to various auricular, ocular, respiratory, and cardiovascular manifestations. Auricular and ocular signs are the most common presenting features; however, idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome is considered a rare manifestation of the disease. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, but immunomodulatory therapy may be required for refractory cases. CASE REPORT We present a challenging case of RP in a 58-year-old woman with HIV controlled by highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and stable chronic reactive arthritis on sulfasalazine who developed unilateral auricular chondritis associated with contralateral idiopathic orbital inflammation and scleritis as well as worsening arthralgia. She was initially treated empirically with antibiotics, without clinical improvement. The infectious diseases work-up was unrevealing, and other diagnostic possibilities were meticulously excluded. Clinical suspicion for RP ultimately led to appropriate therapy with corticosteroids and subsequent immunosuppression with methotrexate, resulting in clinical improvement and allowing for gradual tapering of steroids. CONCLUSIONS RP is an uncommon multisystem disorder that can occur in the setting of other underlying chronic illnesses, as seen in our patient. It has a variable presentation and course, with no diagnostic laboratory tests; therefore, clinical suspicion is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management.\n\nTEXT:\npmcBackground\n\nRelapsing polychondritis (RP) is an uncommon systemic immune-mediated inflammatory disease that affects organs rich with cartilage, such as the ears, nose, laryngotracheobronchial tree, and joints. Less commonly, RP can affect the kidneys, eyes, central nervous system, blood vessels, and heart [1,2]. RP affects up to 3.5 in 1 million people per year [3,4]. Higher prevalence is reported in the fourth and fifth decades of life, with a slight preponderance in white people [3,5].\n\nAn underlying autoimmune process has been attributed to the pathogenesis of RP; however, the exact etiology is still unknown [3]. RP has a variable pattern at presentation, which varies from non-specific symptoms such as fever and arthralgia to auricular, ocular, respiratory, and cardiovascular manifestations [2,3]. Auricular and ocular manifestations are considered the most common presentations of RP; however, periorbital signs have been reported infrequently [3,6\u201310].\n\nThe coexistence of RP with other autoimmune diseases has been found in 30% of cases, most commonly with rheumatoid arthritis, while an association with reactive arthritis has not been previously reported [3]. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of HIV and RP has been only mentioned in a few cases in the literature [11\u201314]. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy; nevertheless, immunomodulatory agents may be required for refractory cases [15].\n\nRP diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, particularly in early stages of the disease. Herein, we report a case of RP in 58-year-old woman with controlled HIV and stable reactive arthritis who developed unilateral auricular chondritis and idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome with scleritis. The infectious diseases work-up was unrevealing, and she ultimately responded well to corticosteroids along with methotrexate.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 58-year-old white woman with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and chronic reactive arthritis presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with a 2-week history of severe acute left eye pain, redness, and swelling associated with blurred vision, photophobia, and watery discharge, but no itching or loss of vision. Ophthalmology diagnosed left eye scleritis with corneal ulceration. She also reported right ear burning pain, redness, and swelling, but no discharge, tinnitus, or hearing loss, as well as loss of appetite and arthralgia. She denied shortness of breath, cough, change in voice, fever, oral ulcers, rash, joint swelling, weight change, change in bowel habits, or urinary symptoms. Her medical history is significant for HIV controlled on HAART (Darunavir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir alafenamide 800-150-200-10 mg), chronic reactive arthritis (HLA-B27 negative) diagnosed 12 years prior on sulfasalazine 2 g divided twice daily, and hypertension on lisinopril 5 mg daily. She endorsed a family history significant for an unknown malignancy in her father. She was a former smoker and denied alcohol or drug use.\n\nIn the ED, she was afebrile with stable vital signs, breathing comfortably with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The physical exam was remarkable for right auricular erythema, swelling, and tenderness, with no ear discharge. There was left scleral redness with mild left eyelid erythema and swelling, along with clear watery discharge, but no change in vision (Figure 1A, 1B). The remainder of her physical exam, including chest and musculoskeletal exam, was unremarkable.\n\nLaboratory investigations revealed white blood cell count 11 K/uL (normal 4.5\u201311.0 K/uL), hemoglobin at 11.9 g/dL (normal 12\u201316 g/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 67 mm/h (normal 0\u201315 mm/h), and C-reactive protein (CRP) 6.99 mg/dL (normal 0.00\u20130.74 mg/dL). Kidney and liver function test results were within normal ranges. Urinalysis was unremarkable for protein or active sediments. Her COVID-19 RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) testing was negative. The CD4 count was 610 cells/uL (normal 430\u20131800 cells/uL) with an undetectable HIV viral load.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was unremarkable. CT of facial bones, orbits, and sinuses showed left periorbital soft tissue swelling with mild induration in the intra-orbital fat, without mass, asymmetry of the extraocular muscles, or exophthalmos, consistent with idiopathic orbital inflammation (Figure 2). She was treated with 1 dose of intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg and started empirically on cefazolin 1 g every 8 h.\n\nAn infectious diseases work-up for syphilis, tuberculosis, and Lyme disease was unrevealing. Blood and urine cultures remained negative. The rest of her autoimmune work-up was unrevealing, including anti-nuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, complement C3 and C4 levels, anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), anti-dsDNA, and anti-SSA/SSB.\n\nRelapsing polychondritis was diagnosed in the setting of left eye idiopathic orbital inflammation, scleritis, and right auricular chondritis. The patient was started empirically on prednisone 40 mg twice daily and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain control. She improved significantly with steroid treatment (Figure 1C, 1D) and was discharged home on a prolonged prednisone taper.\n\nOver the next 2 months, she failed multiple attempted steroid tapers due to recurrence of left eye scleritis. Her course was complicated by steroid dysglycemia and she was started on insulin. Her HAART was switched to Bictegravir-Emtricitabine-Tenofovir Alafenamide 50-200-25 mg, as Cobicistat raises blood glucose levels. She additionally sustained 2 acute compression fractures of T6 and T7, attributed to long-term steroid use, despite a recent normal bone density scan. Steroid-sparing treatment with azathioprine 50 mg daily was initiated (after normal thiopurine methyltransferase activity was confirmed), which led to severe transaminitis with AST at 195 U/L (normal 10\u201342 U/L) and ALT 348 U/L (normal 10\u201360 U/L), resulting in discontinuation. Although an invasive scleral biopsy at a specialized center was considered, after her liver function tests normalized, she was cautiously treated with methotrexate 10 mg weekly and folic acid, and the methotrexate dose was titrated up to 15 mg weekly. Liver function tests remained within normal limits, and she demonstrated remarkable clinical improvement within approximately 2 months. Methotrexate 15 mg weekly was continued, and her prednisone dose was progressively tapered down to 5 mg daily, with a significant decline in her inflammatory markers, with CRP of 0.14 mg/dL (normal 0.00\u20130.74 mg/dL) and ESR of 12 mm/h (normal 0\u201315 mm/h).\n\nDiscussion\n\nRP is an uncommon autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of multiple cartilaginous and connective tissues in the body, including the ears, nose, eyes, joints, skin, respiratory, central nervous, renal, and cardiovascular systems [16]. Although the etiology is unclear, it is believed that an autoimmune mechanism is involved in the pathogenesis of RP, which may be caused by autoantibodies to type II collagen in the cartilage [3,17]. RP has very diverse and non-specific presentations, which makes it challenging to diagnose, often leading to delays in management [3]. Patients with RP can present with fever, malaise, arthralgias, auricular and nasal chondritis, ocular symptoms, respiratory tract involvement manifested as cough, wheezing, and dysphonia, neurological, and cardiac valvular involvement [16]. Auricular chondritis is the most common manifestation in up to 80\u201390% of patients [3]. Ocular features are reported in up to 50\u201360% of cases, and the most frequent presentations are episcleritis, scleritis, and conjunctivitis [3]. However, orbital inflammatory syndrome is an uncommon presentation of RP and has only been reported in a few cases in the literature [6\u201310]. Idiopathic inflammatory orbital disease, also known as orbital pseudotumor, is a benign inflammatory condition of the orbit manifesting with pain, peri-orbital swelling, conjunctivitis, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia. It is usually idiopathic but has been also associated with autoimmune diseases such as Crohn disease, RP, lupus erythematosus, and giant cell arteritis [8,18].\n\nRP is associated with various other autoimmune disorders in approximately 30% of cases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and, most commonly, with rheumatoid arthritis [3]. However, its association with reactive arthritis has not been previously reported in the literature. The coexistence of RP and HIV has been reported in 5 cases in the literature; 2 of them had co-existing autoimmune disease (sarcoidosis and Bechet\u2019s disease) and 1 case had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [11\u201314]. In addition, RP is associated with malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in 27% of cases [3]. A recent study by Beck et al suggested an association between myeloid-restricted X-linked somatic mutation in the UBA1 gene, a major enzyme in ubiquitylation, and some inflammatory rheumatologic syndromes such as RP, known as VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome, which has been reported to be more common in men [19]. Our patient did not have any hematologic findings suggestive of MDS. Interestingly, specific genetic testing of our patient was pursued, and was negative for the VEXAS/UBA1 mutation.\n\nThe diagnosis of RP is mainly clinical. McAdam et al established diagnostic criteria, which suggest the presence of 3 of the 6 following features for RP diagnosis: bilateral auricular chondritis, non-erosive seronegative inflammatory polyarthritis, nasal chondritis, ocular inflammation, respiratory tract chondritis, and audio-vestibular damage [20]. Damiani and Levine modified the prior criteria to the presence of 1 of the criteria described by McAdam with histopathological confirmation or 2 criteria with favorable response to corticosteroid or dapsone therapy [21]. In 1986, Michet et al published new criteria which require the presence of proven inflammation in 2 of 3 areas (auricular, nasal or laryngotracheal cartilage), or proven inflammation in the cartilage in 1 of these areas plus 2 other signs, including ocular inflammation, vestibular dysfunction, seronegative inflammatory arthritis, or hearing loss [16,22]. Our patient fulfilled the criteria proposed by Damiani and Levine for RP (auricular chondritis, ocular inflammation, and seronegative arthritis) with good response to corticosteroids and methotrexate [21]. Although our patient did not present with bilateral chondritis, patients often do not present initially with multiple areas of involvement. However, other diagnostic possibilities were meticulously excluded. Since our patient improved with corticosteroids and methotrexate, an invasive biopsy, with associated morbidity, was ultimately not required.\n\nMild RP can be treated with NSAIDs, dapsone, or colchicine. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice in more severe forms of RP. However, immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclosporine can be used for refractory cases [3,5,15]. Our patient developed severe transaminitis with a low dose of azathioprine, but interestingly was able to tolerate methotrexate well.\n\nMost published cases of RP have presented with auricular inflammation and/or respiratory symptoms, but only a few cases manifested idiopathic orbital inflammation [1,2,16,17,23]. Those cases were commonly associated with ANCA vasculitis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or Sjogren\u2019s syndrome; however, none have been reported with reactive arthritis [1,24]. Only few reported an association with HIV infection [11\u201314]. The mainstay of treatment in most cases was systemic corticosteroids with or without immunosuppressive agents [1,2,16,17,23].\n\nConclusions\n\nWe present a unique patient with HIV and stable reactive arthritis who developed unilateral auricular chondritis associated with contralateral ocular scleritis, and idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome in the setting of a negative infectious diseases work-up, leading to a diagnosis of RP. Systemic corticosteroids along with methotrexate resulted in a favorable outcome.\n\nFigure 1.

We present a retrospective analysis among 22 relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients who received CAR T-cell therapy with axicabtagene ciloleucel. Filgrastim was administered by physician discretion to seven patients (31.8%), and the median duration of neutropenia after lymphodepleting therapy was significantly shorter for those patients who received filgrastim (5 vs 15\u2009days, P = .016). Five patients (22.7%) developed infection in the 30\u2009days post-CAR T-cell therapy with three patients being Grade 3 or higher. There was no difference in the incidence and severity of infection based on filgrastim use (P = .274, P = .138). Among the seven patients that received filgrastim, six patients (85.7%) and four patients (57.1%) had evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), respectively. Among the 15 patients that did not receive filgrastim, 8 patients (53.3%) and 7 patients (46.7%) had evidence of CRS and ICANS, respectively. There was no significant difference in the incidence of developing CRS or ICANS between the group of patients that received filgrastim and those that did not (P = .193, P = .647). However, there was a significant increase in the severity of CRS for patients that received filgrastim compared to those that did not (P = .042). Filgrastim administration after CAR T-cell therapy may lead to an increase in severity of CRS without decreasing infection rates.\n\nTEXT:\nAbbreviations\nANCabsolute neutrophil count\n\nASTCTAmerican Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy\n\nCARchimeric antigen receptor\n\nCTCAECommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events\n\nDLBCLdiffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma\n\nG\u2010CSFgranulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor\n\nGM\u2010CSFgranulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor\n\nICANSimmune effector cell\u2010associated neurotoxicity syndrome\n\nIFNinterferon\n\nILinterleukin\n\nIQRinterquartile range\n\nRICErituximab/ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nWhile chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T\u2010cell therapy is an exciting advancement in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma (DLBCL), its application is limited by associated toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity and severe cytopenias, with 78% of patients developing Grade 3 or higher neutropenia in the ZUMA\u20101 trial.\n1\n Recombinant granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor (G\u2010CSF) has been widely used to shorten the duration of neutropenia and risk of infection in other settings, such as neutropenic complications after conditioning for hematopoietic cell transplant.\n2\n However, in CAR T\u2010cell therapy, myeloid growth factors have the potential to increase the incidence and/or severity of CRS and immune effector cell\u2010associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) by promotion of proinflammatory cytokine secretion from monocytes and macrophages.\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n Preclinically, monocytes and macrophages are the main source of interleukin (IL)\u20101 and IL\u20106 during CRS.\n4\n, \n5\n Surprisingly, CRS severity is mediated not by CAR T\u2010cell\u2010derived cytokines, but by those of monocytes and macrophages.\n4\n, \n5\n Therefore, we sought to determine if a relationship exists between filgrastim administration, which stimulates myelopoiesis and enhances granulocyte function, and CRS. There is currently a lack of evidence to guide clinicians on the benefits and risks of recombinant myeloid growth factor use in CAR T\u2010cell treatment.\n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nBetween March 2018 and May 2019, we reviewed 22 patients with DLBCL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel with or without concurrent use of filgrastim. Prior to CAR T\u2010cell infusion, all patients received standard lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine 30\u2009mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 500\u2009mg/m2/day on days \u22125 through \u22123, except for one patient that received reduced doses for chronic kidney disease Stage IV (fludarabine 15\u2009mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 375\u2009mg/m2/day). Prophylactic tocilizumab 8 mg/kg was given to all patients at 36\u2009hours after CAR T\u2010cell infusion, with additional doses of tocilizumab and/or steroids given for evidence of CRS/ICANS based on the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus grading system.\n6\n Filgrastim was administered at physician discretion after CAR T\u2010cell infusion at a weight\u2010based dose of either 300 or 480 mcg, and cumulative filgrastim dose was recorded within the first 30\u2009days. Toxicity after CAR T\u2010cell therapy was also assessed up to 30\u2009days postinfusion. Any patient with neutropenic fever was treated with broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics; no prophylactic antibiotics were given. Documented infections were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.\n7\n Antibiotics were also administered for any confirmed infections. Chi\u2010squared test or Cochran\u2010Armitage test were performed to examine association between cohort characteristics and the study variable of administration with or without filgrastim.\n\n3 RESULTS\nBaseline patient characteristics are displayed in Table 1. The median age at the time of CAR T\u2010cell therapy was 65.0\u2009years (interquartile range [IQR], 57.0\u201068.8). The majority (14 patients, 63.6%) had high\u2010grade DLBCL, while 5 patients had DLBCL not otherwise specified, 2 patients had transformed follicular lymphoma and 1 patient had Richter's transformation. Seven patients (31.8%) had refractory DLBCL, while 15 patients (68.2%) had relapsed DLBCL with a median number of relapses prior to CAR T\u2010cell therapy of 1.0 (IQR, 0.0\u20102.0). Thirteen patients (59.1%) had received greater than or equal to three prior therapies. Only one patient (4.6%) had received autologous hematopoietic cell transplant prior to CAR T\u2010cell therapy. Ten patients (45.5%) received bridging therapy for high disease burden before CAR T\u2010cell therapy, which included rituximab/gemcitabine\u2010oxaliplatin (7 patients), cytarabine/thiotepa (1 patient), rituximab/dexamethasone/cytarabine/cisplatin (1 patient), rituximab/ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (RICE, 1 patient) and rituximab/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone (1 patient). The number of cycles of bridging therapy ranged from 1 to 3 with a median of 2.\n\nTABLE 1 Baseline patient and disease characteristics\n\n\tAll patients (N = 22)\t\nAge at time of CAR T\u2010cell therapy (median, IQR)\t65.0 (57.0, 68.8)\t\n\u226565\t12 (54.6%)\t\n<65\t10 (45.5%)\t\nGender\t\t\nMale\t12 (54.6%)\t\nFemale\t10 (45.5%)\t\nEthnicity\t\t\nCaucasian\t12 (54.6%)\t\nHispanic\t7 (31.8%)\t\nAsian\t0 (0%)\t\nAfrican American\t1 (4.6%)\t\nOther\t2 (9.1%)\t\nDisease type\t\t\nDLBCL NOS\t5 (22.7%)\t\nTransformed follicular\t2 (9.1%)\t\nRichter's transformation\t1 (4.6%)\t\nHigh\u2010grade DLBCL\t14 (63.6%)\t\nCell of origin\t\t\nGCB\t10 (45.5%)\t\nNon\u2010GCB\t10 (45.5%)\t\nUnspecified\t2 (9.1%)\t\nRelapse or Refractory\t\t\nRelapse\t15 (68.2%)\t\nRefractory\t7 (31.8%)\t\nNumber of prior therapies\t\t\n<3\t9 (40.9%)\t\n\u22653\t13 (59.1%)\t\nASCT prior to CAR T\u2010cell therapy\t1 (4.6%)\t\nECOG at time of CAR T\u2010cell therapy\t\t\n0\u20101\t21 (95.5%)\t\n2\u20104\t1 (4.6%)\t\nBridging therapy given before CAR T\u2010cell therapy\t\t\nYes\t10 (45.5%)\t\nNo\t12 (54.6%)\t\nAbbreviations: ASCT, autologous stem cell transplant; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; DLBCL, diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; GCB, germinal center B\u2010cell; NOS, not otherwise specified.\n\nSeven of the 22 patients (31.8%) received filgrastim by physician discretion at a target dose of 5 mcg/kg/day with 3 patients receiving 300 mcg/day and 4 patients receiving 480 mcg/day. The median start day of filgrastim was 2\u2009days post\u2010CAR T\u2010cell therapy (range Day \u22122 to Day +7), and the median number of filgrastim doses was 6 (range, 3\u201018). The median duration of neutropenia after CAR T\u2010cell therapy was 5\u2009days (IQR, 4.5\u20108.5) for patients who received filgrastim compared to 15\u2009days (IQR, 8.0\u201030.0) for patients who did not receive filgrastim (P = .016; Table 2). Fourteen patients (63.6%) developed neutropenic fever after CAR T\u2010cell therapy, 6 of whom received filgrastim and 8 of whom had not (P = .193; Table 2). Five patients (22.7%) developed an infection in the 30\u2009days post\u2010CAR T\u2010cell therapy including Clostridium difficile colitis (one patient, Grade 3), Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia (one patient, Grade 4), pneumonia (one patient, Grade 3) and Herpes simplex virus (two patients, Grades 1 and 2). Among the seven patients that received filgrastim, three patients (42.9%) developed an infection and two patients (28.6%) developed a Grade 3 or greater infection. Among the 15 patients that did not receive filgrastim, 2 patients (13.2%) developed an infection and 1 patient (6.7%) developed a Grade 3 or greater infection. There was no difference in the incidence and severity of infection between patients who received filgrastim and those that did not (P = .274, P = .138; Table 2; Figure 1).\n\nTABLE 2 CAR T\u2010cell associated toxicity\n\n\tAll patients (N = 22)\tG\u2010CSF administered (N = 7)\tG\u2010CSF not administered (N = 15)\t\nP value\t\nMedian duration of neutropenia (days) (IQR)\t10 (6.0, 25.8)\t5 (4.5, 8.5)\t15 (8.0, 30.0)\t.016\t\nFebrile neutropenia\t\t\t\t\t\nNo\t8 (36.4%)\t1 (14.3%)\t7 (46.7%)\t.193\t\nYes\t14 (63.6%)\t6 (85.7%)\t8 (53.5%)\t\t\nNew infection\t\t\t\t.274\t\nNone\t17 (77.3%)\t4 (57.1%)\t13 (86.7%)\t\t\nAny grade\t5 (22.7%)\t3 (42.9%)\t2 (13.2%)\t\t\nCRS\t\t\t\t.193\t\nNone\t8 (36.4%)\t1 (14.3%)\t7 (46.7%)\t\t\nAny grade\t14 (63.6%)\t6 (85.7%)\t8 (53.3%)\t\t\nICANS\t\t\t\t.647\t\nNone\t11 (50.0%)\t3 (42.9%)\t8 (53.3%)\t\t\nAny grade\t11 (50.0%)\t4 (57.1%)\t7 (46.7%)\t\t\nSteroids given\t\t\t\t.648\t\nNo\t9 (40.9%)\t2 (28.6%)\t7 (46.7%)\t\t\nYes\t13 (59.1%)\t5 (71.4%)\t8 (53.3%)\t\t\nMore than one dose of tocilizumab given\t\t\t\t.074\t\nNo\t10 (45.5%)\t1 (14.3%)\t9 (60.0%)\t\t\nYes\t12 (54.6%)\t6 (85.7%)\t6 (40.0%)\t\t\nAbbreviations: CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; CRS, cytokine release syndrome; G\u2010CSF, granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor; ICANS, immune effector cell\u2010associated neurotoxicity syndrome.\n\nFIGURE 1 Severity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T\u2010cell associated toxicities based on granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor (G\u2010CSF) use.

Among the seven patients that received filgrastim, six patients (85.7%) had evidence of CRS and three patients (42.9%) had Grade 3 or higher CRS. Among the 15 patients that did not receive filgrastim, 8 patients (53.3%) had evidence of CRS and 1 patient (6.7%) had evidence of Grade 3 or higher CRS. ICANS was noted in 11 patients overall (50.0%), and 9 patients (40.9%) had Grade 3 or higher ICANS. Among the seven patients that received filgrastim, four patients (57.1%) had evidence of ICANS and three patients (42.9%) had evidence of Grade 3 or higher ICANS. Among the 15 patients that did not receive filgrastim, 7 patients (46.7%) had evidence of ICANS and 6 patients (40.0%) had Grade 3 or higher ICANS. There was no significant difference in the incidence of developing CRS (any grade) or ICANS (any grade) between the group of patients that received filgrastim and those that did not (P = .193, P = .647; Table 2). There was, however, a significant increase in the severity of CRS for patients that received filgrastim compared to those that did not (P = .042), but no increase in the severity of ICANS based on filgrastim use (P = .660; Figure 1).\n\nThirteen patients (59.1%) received corticosteroids after CAR T\u2010cell treatment at a median cumulative dosage of 666.7 mg prednisone equivalents (IQR, 445.0\u2010933.3), with the majority (9 patients, 69.2%) receiving steroids in the first 5\u2009days post\u2010CAR T\u2010cell infusion. Half of the patient cohort (12 patients, 54.6%) required at least one dose of tocilizumab in addition to the scheduled prophylactic dose. Among the seven patients that received filgrastim, 5 patients (71.4%) received corticosteroids and 6 patients (85.7%) received more than one dose of tocilizumab. Among the 15 patients that did not receive filgrastim, 8 patients (53.3%) received corticosteroids and 6 patients (40.0%) received more than one dose of tocilizumab. There was no association between filgrastim use and steroid use or administration of additional doses of tocilizumab (P = .648, P = .074).\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nAt our institution, filgrastim was administered after CAR T\u2010cell therapy at physician discretion with less than half of our patient cohort receiving filgrastim (seven patients, 31.8%). Importantly, although the median duration of neutropenia was significantly lower for patients who received filgrastim, there was no difference in the development or severity of infections (P = .274, P = .138). Instead, while patients given filgrastim were not more likely to develop CRS (P = .193), the severity of CRS was higher in those that received filgrastim (P = .042), as has been suggested by preclinical data modeling myeloid growth factors in combination with CAR T\u2010cells.\n4\n, \n5\n The development of CRS is related to activation of in vivo T\u2010cell expansion and the production of T\u2010cell effector cytokines, including IL\u20106, IL\u201010 and interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3,\n8\n which are also downstream products of myeloid cells stimulated by filgrastim. One preclinical study showed that higher levels of murine G\u2010CSF correlated strongly with CRS severity and survival.\n5\n Elevated systemic levels of IL\u20106 in particular have been associated with severe CRS, and IL\u20106 receptor blockade with the monoclonal antibody tocilizumab is an important agent used to reduce CRS toxicity.\n9\n, \n10\n Of all the cytokines analyzed in the ZUMA\u20102 study, only peak levels of granzyme B and granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM\u2010CSF, a closely related protein to G\u2010CSF) were associated with severe CRS and severe ICANS.\n11\n\n\n\nCAR T\u2010cell associated neurotoxicity has been associated with elevations in similar inflammatory markers to CRS (IL\u20106, IL\u201010, IFN\u03b3), in addition to higher serum levels of G\u2010CSF and GM\u2010CSF.\n12\n, \n13\n Mouse models of CRS and ICANS have suggested that the main driver of CAR T\u2010cell neurotoxicity is actually IL\u20101 secretion from activated macrophages.\n4\n, \n5\n Unlike its efficacy in CRS, tocilizumab did not protect mice from lethal neurotoxicity, a finding analogous in humans; however the IL\u20101 receptor antagonist anakinra abolished both CRS and neurotoxicity.\n4\n, \n12\n Interestingly, in addition to its stimulatory effects on granulocytes, filgrastim has immunomodulatory effects on other immune cells and can inhibit inflammatory cytokine production within monocytes or macrophages.\n14\n This may account for why we found no association with filgrastim and the development or severity of neurotoxicity (P = .647, P = .660). GM\u2010CSF, which induces both granulocytes and macrophages, may be more closely tied to neurotoxic effects and, in fact, GM\u2010CSF inhibition has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and prevent CRS.\n15\n\n\n\nThe guidelines on use of filgrastim and other growth factors with CAR T\u2010cell therapy are not standardized. While some recommend administration of myeloid growth factors once absolute neutrophil count (ANC) decreases to <500/\u03bcL and to continue until ANC increases to \u22651500/\u03bcL,\n16\n others recommend administration of filgrastim only if patients develop Grade 1 CRS at the same time as neutropenia or in the setting of neutropenic fever.\n17\n The use of myeloid growth factors across institutions employing CAR T\u2010cell therapy is also mixed. In an electronic survey on the current administrative, logistic and toxicity management practices of CAR T\u2010cell therapy across the United States by the ASTCT, out of 28 respondents, 46% used growth factor if allowed by product labeling, 29% never administered growth factor, 14% determined the use of growth factor on a patient\u2010specific basis and 11% administered growth factor to all patients.\n18\n\n\n\nAlthough our study is limited by its small sample size and retrospective nature, we suggest that myeloid growth factor administration be used with caution in patients undergoing CAR T\u2010cell therapy. We found an association between filgrastim use and CRS severity, suggesting that increasing the number of patients in the study would strengthen the association. However, the effect size of the association was small. Further studies are required to determine the safety of myeloid growth factors after CAR T\u2010cell therapy.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest.\n\nETHICS STATEMENT\nThis study was approved by the University of California Los Angeles Institutional Review Board.

We present a case of a 74-year-old gentleman who was being treated for COVID-19 pneumonitis and a concomitant segmental pulmonary artery thrombus with conventional treatment and anticoagulation. The patient developed significant haemoptysis during admission. A repeat computed tomography pulmonary angiogram revealed an 8 mm left upper lobe pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm. Anticoagulation was withheld and the pseudoaneurysm was successfully treated with endovascular embolisation with an Amplatzer\u00ae IV plug, leading to resolution of the haemoptysis. To our knowledge this is the first case of a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm secondary to COVID-19.\n\nTEXT:\n1 Introduction\n\nPulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms (PAPs) are an uncommon and potentially fatal cause of haemoptysis [1,2]. These are defined as a focal dilatation of a pulmonary artery branch, exclusively confined to the outer vessel layer known as the tunica adventitia. The aetiology of PAPs can be separated into idiopathic or acquired causes. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection with associated cavitation has traditionally been associated with development of PAPs and these are referred to as Rasmussen aneurysms. Additional causative factors include: trauma, vasculitis, neoplasia, pulmonary hypertension and Hughes-Stovin Syndrome [1]. Early recognition and treatment is crucial to reduce the high risk of mortality.\n\nThere is a breath of knowledge emerging in recent times regarding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, and its multi-systemic effects on the human body. There is evidence to support its link with vasculitic processes such as pulmonary vasculitis, Kawasaki\u2019s disease and cutaneous vasculitis [3]. In addition, COVID-19 infection has also been associated with increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, which is treated currently with anticoagulation [4]. Furthermore, there have been a scarce number of case reports highlighting an association of COVID-19 with cerebral aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [5].\n\nWe present a challenging case of a 74-year-old gentleman with COVID-19 pneumonitis who, during his admission to intensive care, was diagnosed with a left upper lobe PAP following an episode of life-threatening haemoptysis whilst on anticoagulation for a concomitant pulmonary thrombus. This was successfully treated with emergency endovascular embolisation. We highlight this rare finding and discuss the challenges of managing multiple coexisting pulmonary pathologies secondary to COVID-19.\n\n2 Case report\n\nA 74-year-old gentleman presented to the emergency department with a one week history of fever, shortness of breath, dry cough and fatigue. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and acid reflux. A chest radiograph on admission showed bilateral patchy consolidation with a peripheral predominance. The clinical and radiological features were in keeping with a likely diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonitis. The patient was tested positive for COVID-19 on nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab. He initially received a combination of dexamethasone and intravenous antibiotics. Unfortunately, 3 days into the admission, he clinically deteriorated and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for intubation and ventilation.\n\nOne week into ICU admission, due to persistently low saturations and a rising D-dimer, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed (Fig. 1). This revealed a non-occlusive pulmonary thrombus within the right lung middle lobe segmental pulmonary artery, on a background of diffuse lung parenchymal changes consistent with COVID-19 pneumonitis. He was initiated on subcutaneous treatment dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).Fig. 1 CTPA. A) Non-occlusive filling defect within the segmental branch of the middle lobe pulmonary artery within the right lung, in keeping with pulmonary embolus/immunothrombus (yellow arrow). B) Diffuse bilateral peripheral patchy ground glass attenuation, consolidation and subpleural reticulation consistent with COVID-19 pneumonitis. Note is made of bilateral pleural effusions, likely secondary to concomitant fluid overload (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.).\n\nFig. 1\n\nTwo months into his prolonged stay, the patient developed acute life-threatening haemoptysis and underwent a repeat CTPA. This illustrated an 8 mm left upper lobe pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm with an adjacent left apical pneumatocele (Fig. 2). Anticoagulation was withheld and the patient underwent emergency embolisation of the pseudoaneurysm in interventional radiology (Fig. 3). Pulmonary artery angiography was performed using a right common femoral vein access. Initially, a 4 French 11 cm (Cordis\u00ae) sheath was placed. The left main pulmonary artery was cannulated with a 4 French 100 cm multi-purpose A-2 (MPA2) catheter (Cordis\u00ae) and a 6 French 55 cm Flexor sheath (Cook Medical\u00ae) was placed into the pulmonary trunk. The left upper lobe pulmonary artery was selectively cannulated with a 6 French 100 cm Judkins right 4 (JR4) catheter (Cordis\u00ae) and measured 5 mm in diameter. A pulmonary angiogram, following administration of contrast, demonstrated an 8 mm pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm arising from the left upper lobe pulmonary artery branch. This was embolised with an 8 mm Amplatzer\u00ae IV plug (Abbot\u00ae), therefore having an upsizing of 60 %. A satisfactory post-procedure angiographic result was obtained. This was a technical and clinical success since the patient remained free of haemoptysis two weeks after the procedure. An interval CTPA demonstrated no contrast filling the previously seen pseudoaneurysm secondary to the successful placement of the Amplatzer\u00ae IV plug (Fig. 4).Fig. 2 Repeat CTPA.

They are often solitary and a large majority have a predilection to peripheral pulmonary artery branches [1]. Infection remains the leading cause of acquired PAPs and historical data demonstrates strong associations with tuberculosis and syphilis infection, both of which have significantly reduced in incidence due to the success of antibiotic therapy [1,6]. Rasmussen aneurysms are PAPs caused by direct local invasion secondary to an adjacent tuberculous cavity. This leads to weakening of the vessel wall, pseudoaneurysm development and an increased likelihood of rupture [1,6]. Furthermore, there have been reported cases of mycotic PAPs secondary to endovascular seeding from septic emboli in the context of infective endocarditis [7]. However, a main cause of PAP formation in the current era includes trauma or iatrogenic pulmonary injury for example: stab wounds, chest wall injury, lobectomy, lung biopsies and placement of pulmonary arterial catheters (Swan-Ganz catheterisation) [1,2,8].\n\nCT pulmonary angiography is the initial investigation of choice in which a focal dilatation of a branch of a pulmonary artery can be demonstrated with appropriate timing of intravenous contrast [1,9]. However, due to their uncommon presentation, the suspicion of PAPs amongst reporting radiologists is quite low and therefore,these can often be initially overlooked or detected on retrospective evaluation [1]. This can potentially have a profound negative impact on patient outcome which is why a careful correlation with the patient\u2019s clinical history and a high index of suspicion is required.\n\nEndovascular embolisation using coils, gelofoam or plugs is the preferred method of managing PAPs [1,9,10]. This has a good technical and clinical success rate. In our case, we utilised the Amplatzer\u00ae IV vascular plug which is a self-expandable and locally adaptable occlusion device which also has the advantage of selective positioning and repositioning prior to deployment within a vessel [11]. It is particularly useful for targeting distal and tortuous vasculature and has been extensively and successfully used for the treatment of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations [12]. Pre-procedural evaluation with CT pulmonary angiography can also assist with accurate, targeted embolisation and can help distinguish between a bronchial artery versus a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm [9].\n\nResearch into COVID-19 and its systemic effects has demonstrated a definitive increased risk of mortality secondary to diffuse alveolar damage and the development of immunothrombi in the pulmonary vasculature. In addition, COVID-19 has been directly linked to inflammatory and vasculitic processes affecting the skin, pulmonary vasculature and a Kawasaki-like disease phenomenon [3]. The proposed mechanisms for these include upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, complement activation, endothelial damage/dysfunction. Moreover, systemic vasculitides such as Behcet\u2019s syndrome have also been associated with the formation of PAPs which have been treated with both immunosuppressive treatments and endovascular embolisation in severe cases [13]. We therefore postulate that severe inflammation and pulmonary vasculitis secondary to COVID-19 may have contributed to the development of PAP in our case.\n\nFurthermore, there are several reports of iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic pneumatoceles forming in patients with advanced COVID-19 infection [14,15]. These are prone to rupture causing an increased risk of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and surgical emphysema [15]. In our case, a pneumatocele was present adjacent to the left upper lobe PAP. This along with the severe parenchymal inflammation, may have been associated with the development of the PAP in the first place, similar to Rasmussen aneurysms forming in the context of tuberculosis cavitation.\n\nTo our knowledge, we have reported the first case of a PAP on a background of COVID-19. There have however been a few case reports highlighting intracerebral aneurysm formation in patients with the infection [5]. As previously described, COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis and there is strong evidence to support poorer outcomes in patients who develop thrombotic complications [4]. Many institutions therefore adopt a pragmatic approach to anticoagulate patients early with LMWH. This poses a significant challenge to patient management since in the event of incidental pseudoaneurysmal formation, such as the one in our case, the increased risk of bleeding secondary to anticoagulation can potentially prove to be fatal. Clinicians should therefore recognise PAP as a possible complication of COVID-19 and aim to identify and treat this early. We recommend an individualised approach to anticoagulating patients with thromboembolic disease and COVID-19, with careful consideration of the risks of bleeding secondary to a possible underlying PAP.\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nWe describe an index case of a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm secondary to COVID-19 which was successfully treated with endovascular embolisation. Prompt recognition and treatment is vital to prevent mortality. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of this phenomena in the context of COVID-19, especially in patients anticoagulated for concomitant venous thromboembolism.\n\nEthical statement\n\nThe authors have obtained written, informed consent from the patient to publish details and images pertaining to the case.\n\nWe have ensured anonymity of all identifying information, including the clinical and pictorial data.\n\nFunding statement\n\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors report no declarations of interest.",

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nThe Diagnostic Conundrum of Retinitis and a Pigmented Scar.\n\nABSTRACT:\nWe report a finding of a pigmented chorioretinal scar with acute retinal necrosis (ARN) caused by herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection rather than toxoplasma, creating an initial diagnostic dilemma. A 53-year-old functionally monocular male presented with painless floaters and blurry vision in his seeing eye over a period of 4 days. An exam demonstrated anterior chamber (AC) reaction, vitritis, multifocal patches of whitening, and an occlusive retinal vasculitis. A superior pigmented chorioretinal scar with overlying contracted vitreous was noted in the periphery with no adjacent retinal whitening. The patient was treated for both ARN and toxoplasma chorioretinitis until PCR study of the vitreous and AC returned positive for HSV-2 and negative for toxoplasmosis. Management consisted of a dual therapy regimen of both oral and intravitreal antiviral agents as well as oral corticosteroids. The patient's clinical course was complicated by rhegmatogenous retinal detachment within 2 weeks after symptom onset, requiring pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil and intraoperative intraocular incubation with foscarnet. We review emerging evidence for pigmented chorioretinal scars in ARN specifically caused by HSV-2, as well as diagnostic and treatment dilemmas in the management of ARN and ARN detachments.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nAcute retinal necrosis (ARN) is defined by the following characteristics: one or more foci of retinal necrosis in the peripheral retina, rapid progression in absence of antiviral therapy, circumferential spread, occlusive vasculopathy with arterial involvement, and inflammatory reaction in the vitreous and anterior chamber (AC). Varicella-zoster virus is thought to be the most common cause of classic ARN, followed by herpes simplex virus (HSV), and only rarely other viral causes [1]. HSV-2 ARN is relatively less common than HSV-1 or VZV ARN, and pathogenesis is thought to be uniquely due to reactivation of virus acquired from perinatal contact with maternal genital lesions [1, 2]. Previous studies have identified HSV-2 as a cause of ARN in younger patients with the mean age at diagnosis of 24 years compared to mean age at diagnosis of 44 years for HSV-1 [3].\n\nARN has severe visual consequences, with 48% of affected eyes demonstrating a visual acuity of worse than 20/200 6 months after onset of symptoms [1]. Retinal detachment (RD), the most common complication of ARN, occurs in about 75% of patients; on average, detachments occur 2 months after symptom onset [3, 4]. In this report, we present a case of AC reaction, vitritis, mild disc edema, multifocal retinitis, and occlusive vasculitis with a pigmented chorioretinal scar, creating a diagnostic dilemma between ARN and toxoplasmosis chorioretinitis. PCR analysis of the vitreous chamber and AC identified HSV-2 as the causative pathogen.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 53-year-old male who emigrated from Senegal approximately 20 years ago, with a history of phthisical right eye of unclear etiology, presented with 4 days of painless blurry vision and floaters in the left eye. The patient was otherwise healthy with no history of any systemic infection or disease. Review of systems was negative for flashes of light, headache, fever, or other systemic symptoms.\n\nOn examination, visual acuity was no light perception in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 2 mm Hg in the right eye and 13 mm Hg in the left eye. Slit lamp examination of the right eye was consistent with a quiet, painless, phthisical eye. Exam of the left eye revealed diffuse conjunctival injection with granulomatous keratic precipitates across the inferior 50% of the cornea and 2+ AC cell. Posterior exam revealed 0.5+ anterior vitreous cell, 3+ posterior vitreous haze, mild disc edema, and multifocal patches of retinal whitening superior and temporal to the arcades, associated with vessel sheathing and rare hemorrhages. A superior pigmented chorioretinal scar with overlying contracted vitreous was noted in the periphery, with no focal overlying vitritis nor adjacent areas of retinal whitening (shown in Fig. 1a). Fluorescein angiography revealed severe occlusive vasculitis (shown in Fig. 1b).\n\nGiven the patient's emigration from Senegal, unknown immune status, and pigmented chorioretinal scar, the differential diagnosis included toxoplasma or tuberculosis uveitis and ARN. He underwent a vitreous chamber and AC tap, followed by intravitreal clindamycin and foscarnet injections. He was started systemically on trimethoprim 60 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg twice daily and valacyclovir 2 g three times daily. HIV, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing were negative. PCR of vitreous and AC fluid was positive for HSV-2 and negative for HSV-1, VZV, CMV, and toxoplasma.\n\nDue to the positive PCR results for HSV-2, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was stopped, and the patient was continued on valacyclovir. He received intravitreal foscarnet injections every 3 days for a period of 10 days. Due to worsening vitritis and stable to improving retinal whitening, he was started on 30 mg of oral prednisone daily 8 days after his initial foscarnet injection. The day after his fourth foscarnet injection (14 days after symptom onset), the patient presented with a large retinal tear and focal RD in the area of temporal necrosis (shown in Fig. 2a, b). The patient underwent perfluorooctane-assisted 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with temporal retinectomy, extensive 360\u00b0 endolaser, and intraocular tamponade with silicone oil. Prior to fluid-air exchange and silicone oil injection, a standard 2.4 mg/0.1 mL dose of foscarnet was injected into the balanced salt solution-filled vitreous cavity and incubated for 5 min before washout. Since foscarnet does not need activation, brief incubation is thought to be sufficient for viral inactivation [5]. He was continued on oral valacyclovir and prednisone postoperatively, with an attached retina and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/80+1 five weeks after surgery.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion\n\nA pigmented chorioretinal scar in the setting of posterior or panuveitis typically heralds toxoplasma as the inciting agent [6]. Our patient, however, also demonstrated classic signs of ARN, including multifocal retinal whitening and occlusive vasculitis [1]. A pigmented chorioretinal scar has rarely been reported in HSV-2 ARN, possibly as a consequence of asymptomatic perinatal retinal infection [3]. Unlike toxoplasma retinitis, where encystment of the organism typically causes reactivation at the site of the old pigmented chorioretinal scar, HSV-2 reactivation involves retrograde travel into the retina from neuronal ganglia, resulting in retinitis well away from the pigmented chorioretinal scar [6, 7]. In our patient, the temporal location of HSV-2 reactivation away from the superior pigmented scar was, in retrospect, a clinical clue favoring the diagnosis of HSV-2 over toxoplasma, despite the patient being significantly older than the average age of onset for HSV-2 ARN [3].\n\nSevere toxoplasma chorioretinitis can be mistaken for ARN, even absent a pigmented chorioretinal scar. Moshfeghi et al. [8] reported 22 patients with widespread chorioretinitis from toxoplasmosis, including some with retinal vasculitis. Half the patients were initially treated as ARN prior to definitive diagnosis. The advent of PCR-based diagnostics has greatly improved our ability to distinguish between toxoplasma and viral causes to necrotizing retinitis. The sensitivity of viral PCR from the aqueous or vitreous in ARN is high, ranging from approximately 80\u2013100% across several studies, with the largest case series reporting a 92% sensitivity [1]. In contrast, the sensitivity of aqueous PCR in ocular toxoplasmosis is approximately 53% [9]. Thus, when faced with a diagnostic dilemma between ARN and toxoplasmosis chorioretinitis, a negative PCR for ARN organisms can be very helpful in pointing toward toxoplasma as the causative organism. At present, there is scant data to suggest that diagnostic yields between vitreous and AC taps significantly differ [1]. In our case, both the AC and vitreous humors were positive for HSV-2.\n\nThe mainstay of ARN treatment is early induction of oral, intravenous, and/or intravitreal antiviral therapy, with intravitreal injections every 72\u201396 h until quiescence is achieved [1]. Repeated intravitreal injections in combination with systemic antiviral therapy may lead to better visual outcomes and fewer rhegmatogenous RDs than systemic antiviral therapy alone [10]. Intravitreal foscarnet has additional benefits over systemic valacyclovir or acyclovir. First, foscarnet does not require enzymatic activation and rapidly inactivates the virus after short exposure times [10]. Second, foscarnet covers CMV in cases where the cause of retinitis is ambiguous [11]. Finally, foscarnet works against acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV and VZV [5].\n\nThe use of corticosteroids in treatment of ARN remains a controversial topic. Retrospective observational case series on management of ARN with corticosteroids have shown conflicting evidence with regard to improvement in final visual acuity. Although reduction in the inflammatory response with use of corticosteroids may reduce severity of pathology, the time of introduction of corticosteroids is crucial since temporary immunosuppression itself may lead to ARN activation [12]. We started oral steroids 8 days after initial foscarnet injection due to worsening vitritis, with some resulting in mild improvement in the view to the fundus. The patient's retinal tear and associated detachment developed 2 days after start of systemic corticosteroids.\n\nLoss of visual acuity in ARN is commonly due to rhegmatogenous RD, occurring in about 75% of patients on average within 2 months of symptom onset [3, 4]. In our patient, RD occurred in the area of dense temporal retinal necrosis and within 12 h after a foscarnet injection, which was 14 days after symptom onset. Our patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy, retinectomy, endolaser, and silicone oil fill, with intraoperative injection of foscarnet while the posterior segment was filled with BSS. Continued intravitreal foscarnet therapy after silicone oil fill for RD presents risks. The drug presumably disperses only to the aqueous phase in the posterior segment in a silicone oil-filled eye, potentially elevating concentrations well above the intended final vitreous concentration. A case report in which 2 patients received half-dose foscarnet injections over a period of 6\u20138 weeks after silicone oil fill demonstrated retinitis regression without clear evidence of overt toxicity [11]. In our case, we closely monitored our patient with oral valacyclovir only after vitrectomy with silicone oil fill. He demonstrated no further progression of his retinitis over a 5-week postoperative period.\n\nWe present a case of HSV-2 ARN with a pigmented chorioretinal scar in which toxoplasma chorioretinitis was strongly considered during initial exam. The clinical presentation of HSV-2 ARN may partly mimic toxoplasma chorioretinitis due to presence of a pigmented chorioretinal scar. Apart from the pigmented chorioretinal scar, other unusual features of this case include the older age at presentation and the patient's rapid progression to RD.\n\nStatement of Ethics\n\nWritten informed consent for patient information and images to be published was provided by the patient.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\nFunding Sources\n\nJ.M.L.M. and C.D.C. are supported in part by the Heed Foundation.

Rare cases of subacute thyroiditis have also been described following vaccination. Recently, a few cases of subacute thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have also been reported. Here, we present two cases of cytological proven subacute thyroiditis after receiving the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We describe clinical, laboratory, imaging and cytological findings in two cases of subacute thyroiditis that presented in our department 2 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with Spikevax (Moderna Biotech, Spain) and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca; Sweden). Both cases did not have a previous history of thyroid disorders and presented with anterior and lateral neck pain. Clinical test results as well as cytological findings were consistent with subacute thyroiditis. Subacute thyroiditis may develop following a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and should be considered as a possible side effect in cases that present with thyroid pain.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nSubacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory thyroid disorder associated with viral infections. The disease is most prevalent in females. First symptoms usually appear a couple of weeks after an acute symptomatic or asymptomatic viral infection. Clinical presentation may include general signs of infection, front-neck pain, and thyroid dysfunction (1).\n\nNext to several viruses that have been reported as possible causative agents in thyroiditis, the occurrence of subacute thyroiditis has also been described following influenza or Hepatitis B vaccination (2\u20138). Recently, cases of subacute thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, China), Comirnaty (BioNTech, Fosun Pharma, Pfizer, Germany, and USA) and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca; Sweden) have also been described (5, 9\u201312).\n\nHere, we present two cases with subacute thyroiditis 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with Spikevax (Moderna Biotech, Spain) and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca; Sweden).\n\nCase Description\n\nCase 1: Subacute Thyroiditis Following Vaccination With Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca)\n\nA 26-year-old female patient presented in our thyroid outpatient department with distinctive worsening cervical pain that radiated to both ears. She further complained about fever and chills 2 weeks earlier over 2 days after receiving the first dose of vaccination with Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca, Sweden). She did not report any past medical history for thyroid diseases or recent upper respiratory tract infections. She did not have any family history of thyroid diseases.\n\nClinical examination showed tenderness in the thyroid region with pain on palpation. Ultrasound of the neck showed a normal-sized thyroid (12 ml) with heterogeneous echogenicity and bilateral hypoechoic areas with decreased blood flow on color-coded Doppler sonography (Figures 1A,B). Furthermore, cervical lymphadenopathy was detected.\n\nFigure 1 Thyroid ultrasound. (A) Case 1: transverse view of the right thyroid lobe with an ill-defined hypoechoic area (arrow). (B) Case 1: longitudinal view of the right thyroid lobe with decreased blood flow within the hypoechoic areas on color-coded Doppler sonography. (C) Case 2: transverse view of the right thyroid lobe with a distinct hypoechoic area (arrow). (D) Case 2: transverse view of the right thyroid lobe with decreased blood flow within the hypoechoic area on color-coded Doppler sonography.\n\nStandard thyroid function test revealed slightly elevated triiodothyronine (fT3), normal thyroxine (fT4), and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, and anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies were negative (Table 1). Further blood work demonstrated elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cells (WBC).\n\nTable 1 Patient characteristics and test results.\n\n\tCase 1\tCase 2\t\nAge\t26\t49\t\nSex\tF\tF\t\nVaccination\tVaxzevria (AstraZeneca, Sweden)\tSpikevax (Moderna Biotech, Spain)\t\nOnset of symptoms\t2 weeks\t2 weeks\t\nUltrasound\tDistinct ill-defined hypoechoic areas with decreased blood flow\tDistinct ill-defined hypoechoic area with decreased blood flow\t\nFNAC\tFollicular cells, mononuclear lymphocytic cells, granulomatous cells, and multinucleated giant cells\tFollicular cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells\t\nLaboratory test results\tInitial\tFollow-up (6 weeks)\tInitial\tFollow-up (4 weeks)\t\nTSH (0.35\u20134.94 mIU/l)\t1.75\t0.83\t0.5\t0.01\t\nfT3 (1.71\u20133.71 ng/l)\t3.72\t2.6\t3.25\t3.97\t\nfT4 (7.0\u201314.8 ng/l)\t9.3\t9.0\t9.4\t13.9\t\nAnti-TPO (<6 IU/ml)\tNeg\tNeg\tNeg\t33\t\nAnti-Tg (<14 IU/ml)\tNeg\tNeg\tNeg\tNeg\t\nTRAB (<1.75 IU/l)\tNeg\tNeg\tNeg\tNeg\t\nCRP (<5.0 mg/l)\t29.4\t1.0\t21.9\t22.4\t\nWBC (4.0\u201311.0 103/\u03bcl)\t14.3\t9.77\t7.86\t5.75\t\nFNAC, fine-needle aspiration cytology; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; fT3, triiodothyronine; fT4, thyroxine; Anti-TPO, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies; Anti-Tg, Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies; TRAB, anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies; CRP, C-reactive protein; WBC, white blood cells.\n\nIn order to rule out acute bacterial thyroiditis, fine needle aspiration cytology was performed and provided evidence of mononuclear lymphocytic infiltrate and multinucleated giant cells consistent with subacute thyroiditis.\n\nTherefore, the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis was made and the initial treatment effort was an oral medication with ibuprofen 600 mg. Due to a lack of symptomatic improvement the medication was changed to prednisolone 50 mg/d. The patient's symptoms completely resolved within 2 weeks and fT3, CRP and WBC became normal at follow-up. Corticosteroid therapy was gradually tapered. The 6-week follow-up showed full recovery with no clinical residues.\n\nCase 2: Subacute Thyroiditis Following mRNA-Vaccination With Spikevax (Moderna Biotech, Spain)\n\nA 49-year-old female presented with a 3-week history of sore throat after having received her first dose of the Moderna mRNA vaccine 1 month before. Initially, the symptoms were characterized by headaches and difficulty in concentrating. One week later, she experienced a right cervical sore throat with radiation to the ear. She presented to her primary care physician, who performed an ultrasound on the neck and detected, in addition to thyroid nodules in the left lobe, a newly appeared, large, hypoechoic, and indistinct structure in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Furthermore, the patient was seen by an otolaryngologist, which revealed no findings other than the sonographic abnormality in the thyroid gland. Therefore, the patient was presented to our thyroid outpatient clinic for further diagnostics and clarification of a possible fast-growing malignant nodule.\n\nThe patient did not have any past medical history for autoimmune thyroid diseases or recent upper respiratory tract infections. Family history included benign thyroid nodules on the paternal side. The patient's medication consists of a birth control pill and Gynokadin (estrogen for hormone replacement therapy).\n\nThe thyroid gland presented with mild pressure pain. Sonography showed a normal-sized thyroid (10 ml) with land-map-shaped, hypoechoic, confluent areas with decreased vascularity almost filling the right thyroid lobe (Figures 1C,D). Laboratory exams revealed an elevated CRP of 21.9 mg/l.\n\nThyroid function test showed euthyroidism with a TSH in the lower normal range. A complete blood count, especially the leukocyte count was unremarkable (Table 1).\n\nResults pointed to a subacute thyroiditis. However, the patient asked for further clarification of the hypoechoic area in the right thyroid lobe. In order to exclude malignancy and to prove the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis, fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed and showed lymphocytic infiltrates, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells consistent with subacute thyroiditis.\n\nThe patient received symptomatic therapy with 600 mg ibuprofen daily. Due to gastrointestinal intolerance, the patient's private practitioner changed the medication to diclofenac 50 mg/d, and symptoms improved after 2 weeks. However, the patient discontinued the treatment on her own authority after another week and at the 4-week follow-up, thyroid function test showed thyrotoxicosis and positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and symptoms worsened again. Therefore, the medication was changed to prednisolone 20 mg/d. Her symptoms disappeared within a couple of days. The patient is still being followed-up on treatment with prednisolone during tapering.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSubacute thyroiditis is a self-limiting benign thyroid disorder commonly associated with upper respiratory tract viral infection. The pathogenesis of subacute thyroiditis is unknown so far, but an association with several HLA-genotypes, mainly HLA B35, has been described. It is assumed that viral infiltration of follicular cells leads to T-cell mediated cytolytic disruption of follicles and dysfunction of follicular cells (13).\n\nSeveral viruses have been reported as possible agents in subacute thyroiditis including adenovirus, enterovirus, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, Epstein Barr virus, Coxsackie virus, and measles virus (4). Furthermore, some cases of subacute thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been published so far (14). It is assumed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 that allow SARS-CoV-2 to infiltrate human cells might also play a crucial role in the development of subacute thyroiditis as these receptors are highly expressed in follicular cells (15\u201317).\n\nNext to SARS-CoV-2 infection, cases of subacute thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported recently (9\u201312). Iremli et al. (10) reported a small series of three cases that developed subacute thyroiditis following the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, China). Two more cases have been described after vaccination with the mRNA-based Comirnaty (BioNTech, Fosun Pharma, Pfizer, Germany, and USA) (9, 12). Very recently Oyibo (11) presented a case of subacute thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca; Sweden). One of the two cases presented here also developed subacute thyroiditis following the vector-based vaccine Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca; Sweden) while the other case is the first known patient that developed subacute thyroiditis following the mRNA-based vaccine Spikevax (Moderna Biotech, Spain). Vaccinations might trigger thyroid alterations in predisposed patients mediated by an immune response comparable to the T-cell reaction to viral agents. These alterations might be independent of the mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as described patients received mRNA-based vaccines as well as inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and vector-based vaccines. A possible cross-reactivity between thyroid cell antigens and the spike protein of the coronavirus that is produced by the mRNA vaccines has also been assumed (11, 18). Furthermore, development of subacute thyroiditis following other kinds of vaccinations as influenza or hepatitis B has also been rarely described in the literature. To our knowledge, five cases of subacute thyroiditis following influenza vaccination and one case following Hepatitis B vaccination have been published so far (2, 3, 5\u20138). However, the mechanism of the development of post-vaccination subacute thyroiditis remains unknown.\n\nOverall, further data are needed in order to study the association between subacute thyroiditis and SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations or other virus disease vaccinations.\n\nHowever, initial reviews of different SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations showed a satisfactory efficacy against the virus highlighting the importance of mass vaccination and the continuation of vaccination programs worldwide. Common side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations as pain or swelling at the injection site, fever, headache, chills, or nausea as well as rare side effects like subacute thyroiditis are reasonable regarding the risk of Covid-19 infection that led to millions of deaths and patients with long-term consequences worldwide. Therefore, the importance of vaccination against this devastating disease outweighs the minor risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.\n\nBased on the presented cases and data on other cases reported in the literature, subacute thyroiditis should be considered as a possible side effect in all cases that present with thyroid pain following a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\nEthics Statement\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patients for the publication of any potentially identifiable images or data included in this article.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nSevere Late-Onset Grade III-IV Adverse Events under Immunotherapy: A Retrospective Study of 79 Cases.\n\nABSTRACT:\nBackground: For several decades, PD-1 has been a target in malignant melanoma (MM). PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and anti-CTLA-4 (CD152) (ipilimumab) have revolutionized cancer therapy. PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition leads to prolonged lymphocyte effects, which explains the cytotoxicity underlying immune-reaction-based adverse events (irAEs). Most irAEs occur in the first cycle of treatment at a median of 40 days. IrAEs of any grade have been observed in 68.2% of patients, with 10% of patients experiencing severe grade III/IV irAEs. Data on late-onset irAEs are lacking. Methods: Data on patients with advanced melanoma (N = 1862) from March 2016 to March 2021 were obtained from the RicMel database, a French national multicentric biobank dedicated to the follow-up of MM patients. Patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy or a combination therapy and experienced grade III-IV irAEs were selected and analyzed at 7 months, one year and two years after treatment was initiated. Results: Superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) and previous oncological drug administration before immunotherapy are significant risk factors for late-onset irAEs over 2 years after beginning immunotherapy in the univariate and multivariate analysis. The other parameters-sex, mutational status, association of immunotherapy (PD-1i and CTLA-4i) and overall response-were not significantly associated with late-onset irAEs. In our real-life data study, the median onset time of grade III-IV irAES was 128 days after the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy. Conclusions: Our study, using real-life data, suggests that patients with SSM and those who have received previous oncological treatments are more likely to experience late-onset grade III-IV irAES. Further multicentric studies with wider recruitment of patients should be performed to confirm our findings, potentially leading to changes in the recommended treatment for carefully monitored at-risk patients.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1. Introduction\n\nMalignant melanoma (MM) develops from pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes [1] and represents 2 to 3% of cancers [2]. The incidence rate of MM increased the most among all cancers (+371%) between 1990 and 2018, with 15,513 cases in France in 2019.\n\nEvidence suggests that a functional immune system can act in a self-perpetuating mechanism to eliminate or durably control melanoma [3,4]. Immune checkpoints regulate the outcome of lymphocyte engagement with antigen-presenting cells and tumor cells [5], downmodulating the intensity of adaptive immune responses, which provides a spectrum of potential new targets for cancer immunotherapy.\n\nProgrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) is a key inhibitory receptor expressed by activated T and B cells. PD-1 inhibits the proliferation of immune cells that downmodulate effector functions [4,6] and promote self-tolerance. [1]. PD-L1 (B7-H1) is expressed in nonlymphoid tissues [7], whereas its expression is upregulated in MM [8]. Engagement of PD-1 by PD-L1 leads to the inhibition of T-cell receptor\u2013mediated lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion [7], consequently increasing tolerance. The blockade of PD-1\u2013PD-L1 interaction is an effective approach for MM treatment [9]. PD-1 inhibitors, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab [10] and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 or CD152), also block prototypical T-cell checkpoints and have revolutionized cancer therapy [11,12].\n\nPD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition lead to continued and prolonged lymphocyte effects, which explains the cytotoxicity underlying immune-reaction-based adverse events (irAEs). Most adverse events occur in the first cycle of treatment at a median of 40 days [13]. Gastrointestinal, skin and potential irAEs leading to hyperglycemia and thyroid, hepatic and musculoskeletal disorders have been observed following nivolumab and pembrolizumab therapy [14]. IrAEs of any grade have been observed in 68.2% of patients with nivolumab, whereas potentially severe grade III/IV irAEs have been found to be experienced by approximately 10% of patients [15,16].\n\nPD-1i treatment is stopped if a one-year complete response is achieved or tumor resistance occurs. Despite licensing for long-term use, optimal treatment duration is unknown even if some studies propose to stop the treatment for melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy who are progression-free (confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET), coupled or not with tomodensitometry (TDM) at 12 months and with normal LDH) to avoid life-changing and life-threatening immune-mediated toxicities [17]. Nevertheless, some patients receive treatment for several years and data on late-onset irAEs are lacking.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate severe late-onset irAEs, i.e., grade III-IV irAEs, and patient characteristics in the context of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment or combination therapy in real-life settings.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nData on patients with advanced melanoma (N = 1862) from March 2016 to March 2021 were obtained from the RicMel database, a French national multicentric database dedicated to the follow-up of MM patients. Patients who received intravenous anti-PD-1 therapy or a combination of PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 were selected, and the occurrence of irAEs, the number of perfusions and overall survival rates were analyzed.\n\nThe RicMel database (Clinical Trials n\u00b0. NCT03315468) gathers data from 49 participating centers in different French regions. It received ethics committee approval on February 9th, 2012 (no. 12.108) from the Independent Ethics Committee in Paris and received authorization from the French Data Protection Agency (CNIL, DR-2012-259, 28 May 2012).\n\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows:- Patients with unresectable stage IV MM;\n\n- Patients treated with anti-PD-1 or combination therapy\n\n- Patients who experienced grade III-IV irAEs with the administered IT.\n\nRicMel is a declarative French database. All irAEs have been previously studied by local pharmacovigilance surveys to rule out the imputability of immunotherapy from the medical field.\n\nAfter screening the RicMel database, complementary medical data were collected for the included patients at the Nantes University Hospital. We reported 79 grade III/IV irAEs due to PD-1i according to standard guidelines, such as the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). The grading of irAEs was determined by treating physicians (dermatologists and/or oncologists) and reviewed by a physician from the RicMel database. All baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\n\nDetails of 79 grade III/IV irAEs are listed in Table 2.\n\nDetails of 15 grade III/IV irAEs occurring after at least one year of ICI initiation are listed in Table 3 with details on the management of irAEs and recovery time.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nWe performed a Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis of severe grade III-IV irAEs (event of KM curve) to confirm that most of these events occurred during the first months of treatment. We initially analyzed all grade III-IV irAEs and subsequently focused on late-onset irAEs, i.e., irAEs arising after 6 months. Thus, we performed statistical analyses of irAEs at 7 months, 1 year and 2 years.\n\nAll significant parameters in the univariate analysis were further analyzed using a multivariate analysis to determine if the parameters were independent of each other.\n\n3. Results\n\nThe median onset time of our 79 grade III-IV irAES was 128 days after the initiation of ICI therapy. Irrespectively of delay appearance, the most common irAEs we reported were hepatogastroenterologic (n = 37, 47%), dermatologic (n = 12, 15%) and pneumological (n = 5, 6%). Most of the events were grade III irAES (n = 70, 88%), with only 9 (12%) grade IV irAEs.\n\nThe KM curve analysis (Figure 1) revealed that most events (i.e., grade III-IV irAEs due to immunotherapy) occur before 7 months, with 75% of events occurring before 214 days (7 months). At 7 months, 1 year and 2 years, we observed 20, 15 and 4 events, respectively. [Figure 1 near here]\n\nFour late-onset irAEs occurred over 2 years in our cohort of 79 cases:- One SSM wild-type patient experienced grade IV myocarditis that occurred with nivolumab 759 days after the initiation of immunotherapy;\n\n- One ALM NRAS patient experienced grade III pruritus with pembrolizumab that occurred 900 days after the initiation of immunotherapy;\n\n- One SSM NRAS patient experienced grade III optic neuritis with nivolumab that occurred 1249 days after the initiation of immunotherapy;\n\n- One SSM wild-type patient experienced grade IV hepatitis with nivolumab that occurred 1375 days after the initiation of immunotherapy.\n\nAll factors associated with late-onset events (7 months, 1 year, 2 years), as identified by the univariate analysis, are summarized in Table 4.\n\nSSM was significantly associated with irAEs at 7 months (OR = 3.42; p = 0.023), 1 year (OR = 4.40; p = 0.016) and 2 years (OR = 5.33; p = 0.156). The results at 2 years are not significant due to poor outcomes. ALM was significantly associated with irAEs at 2 years (OR = 24.7; p = 0.037) and was not significantly associated with irAES at 1 year (OR = 4.50; p = 0.298) and 7 months (OR = 3.05; p = 0.438). These results were omitted from Table 3 due to the small sample size (two ALM melanoma patients).\n\nThere was a significant risk for late-onset irAEs if patients had received previous oncological treatments (irrespective of whether these treatments were immunotherapy) at 7 months (OR = 8.13; p = 0.008), 1 year (OR = 5.06; p = 0.043) and 2 years (OR = 1.89; p = 0.589).\n\nThe other parameters\u2014sex, mutational status, association of immunotherapy (PD1i and CTLA4i) and overall response\u2014were not significantly associated with late-onset irAEs. We then pooled patients in two groups, those under 75 years of age and those over 75 years of age. The respective ORs at 7 months, 1 year and 2 years were 0.52, 0.61 and 0.59, but these results were not significant. The results were similar when 70 years of age was used as the cutoff.\n\nThe results were not significant with an OR = 1.57 (0.19\u201310.6) and p = 0.390 at 7 months, an OR = 1.28 (0.41\u20133.96) and p = 0.670 at 1 year and an OR = 1.42 (0.56\u20134.34) and p = 0.733 at 2 years when comparing nivolumab administered at 3 mg/kg and at a flat dose of 480 mg.\n\nAll significant parameters in the univariate analysis were subsequently analyzed by a multivariate analysis. The results are summarized in Table 5.\n\nSSM was confirmed to be a significant risk factor by the multivariate analysis (aOR = 4.46 p = 0.012 at 7 months and aOR = 5.23 p = 0.01 at 1 year). Previous oncological drug administration before immunotherapy remained a risk factor in the multivariate analysis. Due to a lack of data, no results are available for irAEs at the 2-year time point.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur study shows that SSM and previous oncological drug administration before immunotherapy are significant risk factors for late-onset irAEs, i.e., irAEs that arise over 2 years after beginning immunotherapy.\n\nThe Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis revealed that the median onset time of grade III-IV irAES is 128 days after the initiation of ICI therapy; in contrast, 91 days is reported in the literature [18] to be the median onset time of all-grade irAEs. Adverse events are commonly observed in melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy, and almost 20% of patients experience grade III-IV treatment-related adverse events [4,6]. The most common AEs are hepatogastroenterologic complications (AST or ALT increased, diarrhea, colitis, hepatitis) or pneumonitis [15,19]. In our real-life data study, the notable grade III-IV adverse events observed were colitis (n = 15, 19%), hepatitis (n = 13, 16%), cholangitis (n = 7, 9%) and pneumonitis (n = 4, 5%), which is consistent with those observed in a meta-analysis of clinical trial data [19]. Some studies have reported that fewer adverse events are associated with nivolumab [20,21,22], but these results were not statistically significant.\n\nFour late-onset irAEs occurred over 2 years in our cohort of 79 patients. One patient experienced pruritus and another experienced hepatitis, which are well-known and frequently described irAEs associated with PDis. Additionally, one patient experienced myocarditis and one experienced optic neuritis. An extensive physical examination revealed no etiology underlying the patient\u2019s pruritus apart from immunotherapy. Neurologic or cardiac irAEs in patients treated with ICIs are uncommon (<1%) but usually severe, with high morbidity and mortality rates [23]. We identified a patient with grade III irAE optic neuritis that occurred 1249 days after the initiation of immunotherapy. There were no indications of PD1i-induced Vogt\u2013Koyanagi\u2013Harada disease (VKH), which consists of uveitis, optic neuritis and choroiditis [24]. There are a few cases reported in the literature of profound vision loss due to optic neuritis occurring 4 months after immunotherapy initiation [25]. We identified a patient with grade IV irAE myocarditis that occurred 759 days after the initiation of immunotherapy. Autoimmune myocarditis secondary to the immune infiltration of CD4+ T cells into the heart [26] is a rare but often fatal event associated with checkpoint-inhibitor immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies have focused on late-onset irAEs; however, some case reports exist regarding late-onset cardiological irAEs [27,28], late-onset pneumonitis [29] and gastroenterological events [30]. All late-onset irAEs occurred with PD1i and none with combination therapy. The combination of PD1i-CTAL4i is more likely to provide acute irAEs than late-onset irAES, especially because it is administrated only for the first four regimens (i.e., for 9 weeks). After that, patients are treated with nivolumab only.\n\nOur study revealed that there is a significant risk for late-onset irAEs if patients have received previous oncological treatments (irrespective of whether these were immunotherapies), indicating that cumulative exposure to treatment agents increases the risk of irAEs. A significant dose-dependent increase in PD1i-associated adverse events has been reported [21,31]; however, no similar results are available comparing a 3 mg/kg nivolumab dose (n = 46) to a flat nivolumab dose (n = 18) OR = 1.42 (0.56\u20134.34); p = 0.733, probably due to an imbalance in patient recruitment between these two groups. Given the mechanism of action of immune-checkpoint inhibitors, which promote T-cell activation and enhance T-cell activity, specific adverse events that are mostly of immunologic origin typically arise. This explains why there are more late-onset irAEs with a cumulative dose of PD1i, whereas early irAEs are more dose-dependent, rather than related to the drug mechanisms.\n\nIn addition, our results indicate that there is no association between late-onset irAEs and an initial favorable response since the ODs are 1, 0.69 and 1.54 at 7 months, 1 year and 2 years, respectively. These results are in agreement with those previously reported [32], in which irAE occurrence, irrespective of early or late onset, was found to be associated with improved PFS outcomes and better OS rates. This observation was similar regarding radiologic immune-mediated adverse reactions (i.e., colitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis) [33].\n\nDespite the immune senescence and immune system deregulation that affects antigen-presenting cells, T lymphocytes and effector molecules in the geriatric population [34], immunotherapy treatment seems to be effective and safe for patients over 80 years of age [35]. Some researchers have reported that older patients have a better response and fewer irAES than younger patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors [36]. Others have revealed that response rates and toxicity outcomes in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors are not altered with increasing age or comorbidity [37]. The number of comorbidities and ECOG status, or WHO performance status, are variables not associated with severe irAEs [38]. In our study, we observed a trend indicating that age over 75 years could be a protective factor (OR 0.52, 0.61 and 0.59 at 7 months, 1 year and 2 years, respectively); however, the results were not significant.\n\nMost melanomas result from the inability of a skin phototype to repair the intracellular damage induced by UV radiation. Sunburn episodes in early childhood appeared to be more strongly related to SSM than to other variants [39]. The results of a recent study showed that helioderma could be a predictive clinical biomarker of a favorable PD-1i response [40]. Our study confirmed that SSM melanoma is a risk factor for irAEs at 7 months (OR = 3.42; p = 0.023), 1 year (OR = 4.40; p = 0.016) and 2 years (OR = 5.33; p = 0.156). These results could be explained by the long horizontal growth pattern of SSM, enabling it to achieve closer and longer contact with the immune environment than other melanomas, allowing for more contact with cytotoxic lymphocytes. Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRM cells) promote a durable melanoma\u2013immune system equilibrium that is confined to the epidermal layer of the skin [41]. This explains the higher incidence of irAES associated with SSM on the one hand; on the other hand, it leads to better PFS and OS outcomes among SSM patients.\n\nAs this was a monocentric study, our results are not powerful enough to make recommendations. However, our results confirm the necessity of performing a larger multicentric cohort study analyzing data from all participating centers from the national RicMel database.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nOur study suggests that patients with SSM and those who have received previous oncological treatments are more likely to experience late-onset grade III-IV irAES. No other study using real-life data has been performed to investigate late-onset irAES. Further multicentric studies with a wider recruitment of patients should be performed to confirm our findings.\n\nThe long-term safety of PD-1i was determined to be acceptable, since we reported very few late-onset irAEs. However, the potential for grade III-IV irAEs justifies stopping immunotherapy after achieving a one-year complete response to avoid these adverse events.\n\nIt could be relevant to modify how clinicians monitor irAEs, especially in young patients with melanoma and a long treatment duration. Even after achieving a one-year complete response, these patients should be closely followed over the long-term to quickly identify and address potential adverse events.\n\nOngoing prospective clinical trials will further assess the impact of immunotherapy on all grade III-IV late-onset adverse effects and provide information on how to carefully monitor individual patient risk.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, B.D. and A.K.; methodology, J.-M.L.; software, J.-M.L.; validation, B.D. and A.D.; formal analysis, J.-M.L. and E.V.; investigation, J.-M.L.; resources, B.D. and A.K. and E.V.; data curation, E.V.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.-M.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.-M.L.; visualization, J.-M.L.; supervision, B.D. and A.D.; project administration, B.D.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\n\nFunding\n\nThis research received no external funding.\n\nInstitutional Review Board Statement\n\nThe RicMel database (Clinical Trials n\u00b0.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nDisseminated Histoplasmosis in an Immunocompetent Patient After COVID-19 Pneumonia.\n\nABSTRACT:\nDisseminated histoplasmosis can occur in immunocompromised patients such as in HIV disease and patients with medication-induced immunosuppression. Most of these patients present with fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. There are increasing reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia associated with fungal infections including aspergillus and mucormycosis. It is not typical for immunocompetent patients to present with disseminated fungal disease. We herein report a case of a 50-year-old immunocompetent male with a recent recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with fever and pancytopenia. Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated new-onset right upper lobe lung mass, subcarinal lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Mediastinal lymph nodes and bone marrow biopsies were performed, and the patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis. The association between COVID-19 pneumonia and fungal infections is increasingly reported. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, especially in immunocompetent patients.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia-associated fungal infections are well documented with risk factors including ICU prolonged length of stay, neutropenia, hematological malignancies treated with chemotherapy, transplantation, and other immunocompromised states like HIV [1,2]. Disseminated histoplasmosis is often seen in immunosuppressed patients, and can present with multisystem involvement including the lungs, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and bone marrow [3-5]. Disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with post-COVID-19 pneumonia is rare and is difficult to diagnose [6]. A disseminated disease requires treatment and with amphotericin B for one to two weeks followed by azole antifungal therapy [7].\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 50-year-old male\u00a0that lived in the Ohio River Valley\u00a0with a history of mild intermittent asthma\u00a0well controlled on albuterol and fluticasone-salmeterol and no recent requirement of oral corticosteroids\u00a0was admitted for\u00a0daily\u00a0cyclical fevers after COVID-19 pneumonia. One month before admission, the patient was treated\u00a0on the medical-surgical floor\u00a0for COVID-19 pneumonia with a five-day course of remdesivir and a 10-day course of dexamethasone. The patient recovered and he was discharged home without oxygen. Two weeks after discharge, he developed fever and myalgias. The patient had two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 testing that both were negative. On hospital admission, COVID-19 PCR testing was also negative. His blood work on admission revealed WBC 7.9 x 103 uL, hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, and platelets 146 x 103 uL. A non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT) revealed interval improvement of ground-glass opacities, a new 3.9 cm mass-like density in the right upper lobe (RUL), mildly enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and moderate-severe hepatosplenomegaly (Figures 1, 2). The patient was started on\u00a0vancomycin and cefepime and transitioned to linezolid, levofloxacin, voriconazole, and piperacillin-tazobactam after no\u00a0improvement in his fevers as high as\u00a039.9\u00b0C.\u00a0The patient continued to be febrile daily until hospital day 14 despite antipyretics.\u00a0He was first noted to have pancytopenia on hospital day 7 with a possible cause due to Linezolid which was stopped on hospital day six.\u00a0His repeat blood work revealed WBC 2.8 x 103 uL, hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL, platelets 50 x 103 uL, and ferritin 2,934 ng/mL. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound and transbronchial needle aspiration of subcarinal lymph node and biopsy of the RUL mass. Fine needle aspiration of the subcarinal lymph node showed budding yeast suggestive of histoplasmosis on the Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) stain (Figure 3).\u00a0The Histoplasma galactomannan urine antigen was positive at 1.6 ng/mL (reference range < 0.2 ng/mL).\u00a0The patient\u2019s serum cryptococcal antigen and antibody and blastomyces antibody were negative. The bronchial alveolar lavage and tissue biopsy of the right upper lobe mass isolated Histoplasma capsulatum.\u00a0Bone marrow biopsy revealed extensive granulomatous inflammation consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis. His cyclic fevers ceased, and pancytopenia improved with amphotericin-B. He was discharged from the hospital one week after starting treatment with a plan of two weeks of therapy and transition to oral fluconazole.\n\nFigure 1 CT of the chest with right upper lobe (RUL) mass.\n\nFigure 2 CT of the chest with subcarinal lymph node enlargement.\n\nFigure 3 Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) stain with budding yeast.\n\nDiscussion\n\nRisk factors for most of the reported cases of disseminated histoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients include living in a rural setting due to the likely exposure to histoplasma in the soil [8]. Most of these patients experienced fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, elevated ESR, elevated hepatic transaminases, and had bone marrow involvement [8,9]. An immunocompromised state, including HIV/AIDS and chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression, is a known risk factor for disseminated histoplasmosis. There is a reported case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with HIV/AIDS after COVID-19. This patient presented with an initial CD4 count of 113 cells/mm3 and a viral load of 38,503 RNA copies/ml. One week after the initial presentation, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and with suspected disseminated histoplasmosis based on a positive histoplasmosis antigen and CT scan with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly [6]. Another patient with underlying asthma and diabetes mellitus presented with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by pulmonary embolism and prolonged hospitalization was diagnosed with pulmonary histoplasmosis based on positive Histoplasma capsulatum complement fixation titers [10].\u00a0\n\nCo-infecting pathogens with COVID-19 are well documented, and patients are more likely to die than those without a co-infection [2]. Initial reports included both viral and bacterial causes [2,11]. Fungal co-infections are increasingly reported after COVID-19 and are also known to increase mortality as well [12]. Most reported cases include aspergillus with a prevalence as high as 8.5% in retrospective studies and 9% in a meta-analysis [2]. Risk factors not mentioned previously for aspergillosis include antibiotics, particularly azithromycin (cumulative dose >/= 1500 mg) [13]. Many of these patients may be treated with Voriconazole to avoid the potentially nephrotoxic liposomal amphotericin B [12]. Candida, which is often isolated in the respiratory tract, is usually not thought to be pathogenic [1,2] and the reported cases of candida bacteremia were thought to be related to central line infections [14]. Other reported non-disseminated fungal co-infections include coccidioidomycosis, mucormycosis, and cryptococcosis [1,11].\n\nAcute pulmonary histoplasmosis presents with either asymptomatic disease, flu-like symptoms, caseating or noncaseating granulomatous disease, or mediastinal adenopathy. Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis presents with an either cavitary or noncavitary disease with associated nodules, infiltrates, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Disseminated disease is often seen in immunosuppressed patients. Manifestations can include skin involvement with polymorphic plaques, nodules, and erosions, gastrointestinal involvement with hepatosplenomegaly and colonic ulcerations, and bone marrow suppression [3,4].\n\nDiagnosis of disseminated disease is complex as many tests take weeks. Cultures often take two to four but up to eight weeks with the greatest yield occurring in those with disseminated disease. Complement fixing antibodies may appear two to six weeks following acute infection and may persist for years following infection. Immunodiffusion antibody assay tests for the presence of M and H precipitin bands. M bands develop with acute infections and persist for months to years. H bands appear after an M band and may disappear earlier than M bands. These may indicate active histoplasmosis [3]. Antigen testing may be more effective in acute disease and immunocompromised patients who cannot amount an antibody response with improved sensitivity utilizing both serum and urine testing. A polymerase chain reaction is available but still needs further standardization [3,15].\n\nTreatment for the mild asymptomatic acute pulmonary disease is often unnecessary. Moderate to severe acute pulmonary disease requires treatment with amphotericin B followed by azole antifungal therapy for weeks. Chronic pulmonary disease is treated with azole antifungal therapy for 12-24 months. The disseminated disease requires treatment with amphotericin B for one to two weeks followed by azole antifungal therapy for at least 12 months [7].\u00a0\n\nConclusions\n\nWe presented a case of disseminated histoplasmosis after COVID-19 pneumonia effectively treated with amphotericin-B and fluconazole. The patient was eventually discharged home with resolution of his cyclic fevers and pancytopenia. Fungal infections are increasingly reported in association with COVID-19 pneumonia. Although not able to prove, prolonged courses of dexamethasone may be a risk factor for disseminated fungal infections. Clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of disseminated fungal diseases even in immunocompetent patients.\n\nHuman Ethics\n\nFigure 2 provided by Dr. Ali Ismail MBBS, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine 2021.\n\nThe authors have declared financial relationships, which are detailed in the next section.\n\nKarim El-Kersh declare(s) personal fees from United Therapeutics, Actelion, Acceleron Pharma.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nRemoval of COVID-19 Spike Protein, Whole Virus, Exosomes, and Exosomal MicroRNAs by the Hemopurifier\u00ae Lectin-Affinity Cartridge in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 Infection.\n\nABSTRACT:\nCoronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout the world resulting in a significant amount of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in therapy, social distancing, masks, and vaccination many places in the world continue to see an increase in the number of cases and deaths. Viremia is commonly present in severely ill patients with COVID-19 infections and is associated with organ dysfunction and poor outcomes. Exosomes released by activated cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. We report the experience of two cases of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with the Hemopurifier; a lectin affinity cartridge designed to remove mannosylated viruses and exosomes. Both patients tolerated the Hemopurifier sessions without adverse effects. In the first patient removal of exosomes and exosomal microRNAs was associated with improved coagulopathy, oxygenation, and clinical recovery, while in a second patient removal of COVID-19 by the Hemopurifier cartridge was observed. The Hemopurifier is currently under further investigation in up to 40-patients in a safety and feasibility study in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nOn November 17, 2019, the first case of COVID-19, a severe respiratory infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was described in Wuhan, China. The virus rapidly spread across the globe with ~167,391,920 million cases and 3.47 million deaths as of May 25, 2021 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Fortunately, with mitigation measures, treatments and vaccinations, cases and deaths have decreased in many locales, yet many disease hotspots remain. A need to explore additional treatments, particularly in those most desperately ill, remains.\n\nEarly in the pandemic the magnitude of viremia and its clinical importance was underappreciated. A recent meta-analysis has revealed the presence of viremia in 34% of COVID-19 infected patients with higher rates occurring in the critically ill. The presence of viremia was associated with disease severity, and the development of multi-organ failure (1). COVID-19 itself is a prothrombotic virus which activates thrombus formation via endothelial damage and leads to the development of a COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) (2) Exosomes, extracellular vesicles ranging in size from 50 to 150 nm are released by activated cells in response to stimuli. Exosomes are involved in cell to cell signaling via cargo including proteins, receptors cytokines, and genetic material such as non-coding microRNAs (3). Exosomes have recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of severe infection including during COVID\u221219 infection (4). Viral proteins have been found in exosome cargo suggesting that COVID-19 may utilize endocytosis in cell to cell spread. MicroRNAs are involved in mRNA degradation and inhibition of protein translation (5). Differential upregulation of microRNAs during COVID-19 infection is associated with coagulation and inflammation (6, 7).\n\nThe Hemopurifier\u00ae (HP) cartridge (Aethlon Medical, Inc., San Diego, CA) is a hollow fiber plasma separator filled with an affinity resin containing the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) from the Galanthus nivalis plant (the common snowdrop) (8). GNA has a high affinity to mannose-rich glycoproteins which are present on enveloped viruses as well as exosomes (9, 10). A recent in-vitro study demonstrated near complete the removal of the SARSCoV2 spike protein by a mini-Hemopurifier within 30 min (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 The Hemopurifier captures SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. This experiment was performed by circulating a solution spiked with the S1glycoprotein of SAR5-COV-2 over the mini-Hemopurifier column in vitro. Briefly, 10 mlof a 1 \u03bcg/ml solution of SAR5-COV-2 S1 in phosphate buffered saline was circulated over a Hemopurifer column containing 0.7 g of affinity resin at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. The rate of viral S1 capture, expressed as a percentage of S1 remaining in solution vs. time, was established by removing fluid samples at defined time intervals. The control consisted of S1 kept on the benchtop for the duration of the experiment (i.e., not run through the device).\n\nHere, we describe the emergency use of the Hemopurifier in two cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection. The report contains details of the treatments, clinical course, as wells as changes in laboratory values, plasma COVID-19 viral load and total exosome and exosomal miRNA concentrations following treatment. This report is novel in that is the first attempt to remove both virus as well as exosomes from patients with COVID-19 infection.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nHemopurifier Lectin-Affinity Treatment\n\nTwo patients were treated with the Hemopurifier for 6 h daily. The cartridge was operated via a standard dual lumen veno-venous hemodialysis catheter. Blood entered the cartridge where plasma was forced through the pores (\u2248200 nm) of the hollow fiber membrane due to the pressure gradient established. Blood cellular elements remained in lumen of the hollow fibers. Plasma entered the extracapillary space where the lectin-affinity resin resides. Glycosylated molecules were bound by the lectin and prevented from re-entering the circulation. The pressure gradient was reversed along the course of the hollow fibers allowing the plasma to flow backward through the hollow fibers to recombine with the blood before re-entering the circulation (Figure 2) (11).\n\nFigure 2 Mechanism of Action of Hemopurifier Lectin-Affinity Cartridge.

Blood samples for plasma COVID viral load measurement and exosomal analysis were collected in EDTA blood collection tubes prior to and after each Hemopurifier session. Plasma was isolated, deactivated with viral lysis buffer, and shipped frozen to Aethlon Medical for further analysis. The used Hemopurifier cartridge was sealed and refrigerated and then sent back for viral elution by the following methodology. First, used Hemopurifiers were flushed with a 200 ml solution of 0.5 M alpha-methylmannoside (\u03b1-MM), a lectin binding competitor (12), to gently elute a portion of the blood components bound to the resin. Subsequently, Hemopurifier cartridges were flushed with 200 ml of TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher) to elute any remaining blood components, proteins, and nucleic acids still bound to the GNA lectin. A spin column capture methodology was used to isolate RNA eluted in the Trizol solution. Briefly, 1 ml of the Trizol-eluent (frozen at \u221280\u00b0C) was thawed and mixed with 200 \u03bcl of chloroform, vortexed for 15 s and incubated at room temperature on the benchtop for 2\u20133 min. The mixture was then spun at 12,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 15 min and 600 \u03bcl of the upper aqueous phase collected and transferred to a new tube. This was mixed with 1.5 \u00d7 volumes (900 \u03bcl) of 100% EtOH and then added to the QiaAMP Viral RNA extraction column (Qiagen, cat#52906). The remaining RNA isolation procedure from the column was performed as instructed by the manufacturer, and purified RNA was eluted in 45 \u03bcl of AVE Buffer. A one-step RT-qPCR methodology (13) was used for detection of the SARS-nCoV2 virus with the Taqman 2019 nCov Assay Kit (Thermofisher Scientific, Cat# A47532) targeting three unique SARS-nCoV2 genome sequences (N-protein, S-protein, and ORF1ab) and the Taqman Fast Virus 1-step master mix (Thermofisher, Cat#4444434). An estimate of the viral copy number captured on the hemopurifier was calculated by relative comparison to measurements of the positive control standard (Thermofisher Scientific, #A47533).\n\nPlasma COVID viral load testing was accomplished using the same viral RNA detection techniques. The biological specimens, plasma samples (with EDTA anticoagulant) were collected from each pre- and post-Hemopurifier therapy session, and 140 \u03bcl from each plasma specimen was processed in buffer AVL (Qiagen) to isolate nucleic acids using the QiaAMP Viral RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA samples were collected in 30 \u03bcl of AVE Buffer and 5 \u03bcl were used in each RT-qPCR to quantify SARS-nCoV2 viral copy numbers. For comparative analysis of viral loads among distinct plasma samples, calculations were further normalized to the quantity of Ribonuclease P (RNAse P) measured in each sample, a recommended methodology to control for differences in SARS-nCoV2 sample collection and processing techniques (14).\n\nExosomes were purified from patient plasma using an established methodology (15). Briefly, 1 ml of patient plasma was pre-cleared through a two-step centrifugation process (2,000 g for 10 min; 10,000 g for 30 min) to remove larger plasma particles, then filtered through a 0.2 uM PES membrane, and loaded onto a 10 ml Sepharose CL-2B column. Exosomes were isolated from the rest of the plasma components through size exclusion chromatography by adding 1 ml increments of PBS to the Sepharose column until the Fraction #4 eluent, containing plasma exosomes was collected. Exosome quantification data was collected using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) techniques as previously described (16), using a Nanosight LM10 instrument. In order to obtain reliable quantification measurements, plasma exosome samples had to be diluted in 0.2 \u03bcM filtered PBS to a concentration of ~108-109 exosomes/ml. Approximately 20\u2013100 particles could be observed in the Nanosight field of view once exosome samples had been diluted to the appropriate concentration range. Enhanced detection of smaller exosome populations isolated from the COVID plasma was achieved using a Camera Level of 12 and a Detection Threshold of 3 measurement parameters. Three 30 s capture videos of different segments of the homogenous exosome sample were evaluated with the NTA 3.3 software to obtain particle quantification and sizing measurements.\n\nMicroRNA was isolated from the COVID plasma exosomes using the miRNAeasy Serum/Plasma RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, cat#217184) and incorporating an exogenous miRNA spike-in control (5.6 \u00d7 108 copies cel-miR-39-3p miRNA/sample) to control for variability introduced during the sample preparation process. miRNA was reverse transcribed to a cDNA template using the Taqman Advanced miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Cat#A28007). Specific miRNA targets were amplified on a Quant 3 qPCR machine using specific Taqman Advanced miRNA primer/probe sets (hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-16-2-3p, Cat#A25576). Quantification of miRNA sequences was done by normalization to the exogenous spike-in cel-miR-39-3p miRNA control, using \u0394\u0394Ct methods (17). MicroRNAs associated with coagulation, inflammation and acute lung injury were measured.\n\nResults\n\nCase 1\n\nThe patient was a 59-year-old female with a past medical history notable for obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, alcohol abuse, and mechanical aortic valve replacement on warfarin. She was admitted in July 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia and admitted to the general medical ward for oxygen and other therapies. She received a course of dexamethasone and was subsequently given convalescent plasma on hospital day (HD) 8. She developed progressively worsening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) despite high flow nasal cannula O2 followed by bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) therapy. She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on HD 11 for intubation. After intubation, mechanical ventilation and prone positioning, her oxygenation did not improve. She was not considered a candidate for Remdesivir because of the duration of her disease, but she did receive a course of tocilizumab on HD 12 and was also administered high dose methylprednisolone. Despite all interventions, her PaO2/FIO2 ratio continued to decline to the point that she could not maintain adequate oxygenation, while paralyzed on Rocuronium and in the prone position on 1.0 FiO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cm H2O. She was also treated with epoprostenol (EPO) and initially could be supinated while on it but subsequently failed supination even on EPO. She was evaluated for possible extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and deemed to not be a candidate.\n\nOn hospital day 21 the attending physician and an independent physician determined that the patient had failed maximal medical treatment for COVID-19. A written request was made to Aethlon Medical, Inc. for single patient emergency use of the Aethlon Hemopurifier. In accordance with federal regulations governing emergency use, all regulatory documentation was obtained including signed informed consent as well as IRB approval. On HD 22 the patient received her 1st Hemopurifier treatment. Prior to her 1st HP treatment, she was on maximal ventilatory support (FiO2 1.0, PEEP 14 cm H2O, proned). The venous side of the double lumen internal jugular catheter clotted 20 min into the first Hemopurifier treatment. Patency was restored with TPA. The treatment was re-started with a fresh Hemopurifier cartridge, and she successfully completed the prescribed 6-h treatment. She received a 6-h HP treatment once daily 4 days over hospital days 22\u201325. The patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of allergic reaction, thrombotic complications, or hemolysis.\n\nThe clinical impression of the attending physician following the four treatments was that there was a slight improvement in her clinical status. A review of the patient's laboratories (Table 1) reveals that, prior to treatment, she had evidence of COVID-induced coagulopathy (CAC) with thrombocytopenia and a markedly elevated D-dimer level. The patient also had marked respiratory impairment as indicated by a low PaO2/FIO2 ratio, systemic inflammation as indicated by hyperferritinemia and tissue damage as indicated by an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). On HD 27, essentially 2 days after the first 4 HP treatments, the patient had improvements in her markers of coagulation and oxygenation as well as decreases in her ferritin and LDH.\n\nTable 1 Laboratory values over time in emergency use case #1.\n\nDate\tD-dimer (ng/ml)\tPlatelet (cells/mcl)\tPT/INR\tFerritin (ng/ml)\tLactate (mmol/l)\tPaO2 /FIO2 ratio\tFI02\tTidal Volume\tPEEP\tALC (absolute lymphocyte count) (cells/mcl)\tLDH (U/L)\t\nHD 14\n(8 days prior to therapy)\t\t\t\t3599.5\n(systemic inflammation)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2370\n(tissue injury)\t\nHD16\n(6 days prior to therapy)\t>7,650\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHD 18\n(4 days prior to therapy)\t\t115,000\t\t\t3.6\n(tissue hypoxia)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHD 22\n(Day 1 therapy)\t\t\t1.2\n(13.6 s, prolonged)\t\t\t93\t0.70\t400\n(~6 mkl/kg)\t20\t780\n(lymphopenia)\t\t\nHD 23\n(Day 2 therapy)\t\t\t\t\t2.3\t98\t1.0\t400\n(~6 mkl/kg)\t20\t\t\t\nHD 24\n(Day 3 therapy)\t\t\t\t\t\t75.5\t0.90\t400\n(~6 mkl/kg)\t20\t\t\t\nHD 25\n(Day 4 therapy)\t\t\t\t\t\t88.57\t0.70\t400\n(~6 mkl/kg)\t20\t\t\t\nHD 27\n(Day 5 therapy)\t3703\t162,000\t1.0\n(11.3 s, improved)\t622.4\t0.8\n(normal)\t136.25\t0.80\t400\n(~6 mkl/kg)\t20\t1180\t978\n(improved)\t\nHD 30\n(8th day of therapy)\t\t\t\t\t\t127\t0.60\t380\t20\t\t\t\nHD 35\n(5 days after therapy completed)\t\t\t\t\t\t175\t0.6\t380\t20\t\t\t\nHD 42\n(12 days after therapy completed)\t\t\t\t\t\t198\t0.5\t380\t20\t\t\t\nHD 49\n(19 days after therapy completed\t\t\t\t\t\t152\t0.5\t380\t10\t\t\t\n\nGiven the signs of clinical improvement, as well as the thinking that exosomes may still be contributing to the patient's ongoing critical illness, the decision was made to continue the HP treatments for 4 additional days. The patient received 4 additional 6-h treatments from HD 27 through 30. The patient received a low tidal volume (~6 ml/kg) mechanical ventilation strategy for ARDS throughout her ICU stay. Following the last Hemopurifier treatment the patient's FIO2 was able to be weaned to 0.60. She subsequently required a tracheostomy on HD36. The patient's PaO2/FIO2 ratio continued to improve during her hospitalization. She was discharged to a long-term care on hospital day 58 with an O2 saturation of 98% on pressure support ventilation with an FIO2 of 0.45 and 5 of PEEP.\n\nThroughout the Hemopurifier treatment the patient had plasma samples stored for retrospective analysis of plasma COVID viral load as well as exosomal analysis. Blood samples were collected before and after the emergency-use Hemopurifier treatment (6 h/treatment) conducted on 8 different days. The patient's COVID-19 plasma viral load was undetectable at the onset of treatment with the Hemopurifier. Over days 2\u20137 of the HP treatment the total exosome concentrations decreased from pre- to post-HP treatment. Interestingly, the total exosome concentration increased during treatment on Days #1 and #8 (Figures 3, 4). A consistent pattern of decreasing exosomal miR-424 concentrations from pre- to post-HP treatment was observed over the 8 Hemopurifier treatments coinciding with the improvement in coagulopathy. The concentration of exosomal miR-16 dropped over the first 4 Hemopurifier treatments and then stayed at low levels as the patient's acute lung injury improved (Figures 3, 4).\n\nFigure 3 Exosome and Exosomal miR-424 quantification over time in Case 1.\n\nFigure 4 Exosome and Exosomal miR-16-3-3p quantification over time in Case 1.\n\nCase 2\n\nThe patient was a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of tetralogy of Fallot repair, coronary artery disease, and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. He presented to the hospital in January 2021 with a 1-week history of cough and shortness of breath. He was found to be COVID-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) and was admitted to the hospital. The patient was also noted to have acute kidney injury. Despite treatment with Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, Baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and full dose anticoagulation, the patient developed worsening multiple organ system failure. He was on mechanical ventilation with an FIO2 of 100% and 12 of PEEP, a single vasopressor for hypotension and CRRT for acute renal failure. Given the patient's deterioration despite maximal medical support, the treating physician requested the single patient emergency use of the Aethlon's Hemopurifier on HD 8. In accordance with federal regulations governing emergency use, all regulatory documentation was obtained including signed informed consent as well as IRB approval.\n\nThe Hemopurifier treatment was performed on hospital day 9. Prior to the treatment the patient required two vasopressors for hypotension as well as prone position ventilation with an FIO2 of 0.90 and a PEEP of 8 to maintain oxygenation. The pre-treatment SOFA score was markedly elevated at 13 indicating a predictive mortality of > 80%. The patient received 6 h and 15 min of Aethlon Hemopurifier treatment in series with CRRT. The patient had fluctuations in his oxygenation and blood pressure during the completed HP session. The patient was disconnected from the Hemopurifier without incident. An examination of the Hemopurifier cartridge did not reveal changes suggesting clotting or hemolysis and his haptoglobin level was normal.\n\nAn examination of the patient's post-Hemopurifier session labs revealed evidence of clinical worsening with a C-Reactive Protein test (CRP) that had increased from 7.9 to 16.2 mg/dl. The d-dimer level and LDH both increased to beyond the upper limit of detection. Following disconnection of the Hemopurifier the attending physicians elected to change out and reinitiate his CRRT circuit. Approximately 15 min after the new CRRT circuit was placed the patient's blood pressure began to drop. The patient developed refractory shock and refractory hypoxia and expired due to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.\n\nThe Hemopurifier cartridge used on the patient was saved for analysis, and plasma samples for viral load testing were collected before and after the Hemopurifier session. PCR testing done on eluent from the Hemopurifier demonstrated viral capture by the cartridge. Additionally, the plasma COVID viral load normalized for RNAse P decreased by 58% in the sample collected at the end of the Hemopurifier treatment compared to the pre-treatment sample (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Hemopurifier viral capture and change in plasma viral load in case 2.\n\n\t1 PCR R \u00d7 n\tTotal RNA\tTotal trizol\t\tHemo purifier Total\t\nEstimate hemopurifier capture\t\n\t5 ul/r \u00d7 n\t60/5 ul\t200/1 ml\t\tEluted copies\t\nHP-P2Eluent\t242.1\t\u00d712\t\u00d7200\t\t5.8E + 5\t\n\t1 R \u00d7 n\tTotal RNA\tPlasma\tRNAsep\tPlasma\t\nPlasma viral copies normalized to RNAsep\t\n\t5 ul\t45/5 ul\t1/0.14 ml\tNormalization\tCopies/ml\t\nPre-plasma\t24.3\t\u00d79\t\u00d77.14\t\u00d71\t1558.6\t\nPost-plasma\t29.5\t\u00d79\t\u00d77.14\t\u00d70.34\t648.1\t\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this publication we describe the first use of a Hemopurifier lectin-affinity plasmapheresis cartridge in two critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 infection. A total of 9 Hemopurifier sessions were tolerated by these two patients despite multi-organ system failure. The cases build on our experience in a critically ill patient with Ebola where viral removal and clinical improvement was observed following a Hemopurifier treatment (11). Previously the Hemopurifier had been studied in 29 ambulatory patients with > 90 Hemopurifier exposures in clinical studies involving patients with either Hepatitis C (18) or HIV. The safety profile was benign in these subjects with a side effect profile that is typical for other extra-corporeal therapies.\n\nThe first of the two reported cases is notable for the clinical course following Hemopurifier treatments observed in a patient without demonstrable COVID-19 viremia. The absence of viremia was not unexpected given that the patient received her first Hemopurifier treatment on hospital day #22. Following the initial 4 treatments the patient had evidence of improvement in COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), lung injury, inflammation, and tissue injury. We hypothesize that these improvements were due to the removal of exosomes with noxious microRNA cargo by the Hemopurifier. In our patient we observed decreases in total exosomal concentration from pre to post-Hemopurifier treatment over days 2\u20137. A rise in exosomes was noted on the first and eighth day of treatment. We hypothesize that the rise on the first day may have been related to the clotting in the hemodialysis catheter. The rise on total exosome concentration of the eighth day is unexplained and requires further investigation. The net rise in total exosome concentration could possibly be driven by production of exosomes carrying reparative microRNA cargo.\n\nWe specifically examined the microRNA cargo of the exosomes during the Hemopurifier treatments. A decrease in miR- 424 following the initial 4 days of HP treatment at a time when the patient's coagulopathy improved. Gambardella and colleagues found that exosomal miR-424 was upregulated in COVID patients with coagulation activation as indicated by elevated D-dimer levels vs. COVID-19 infected patients with normal D-dimer levels (6). We also noted decreases in miR-16 concentrations throughout the treatment period at a time when the patient's oxygenation was improving. In a rat LPS challenge model of acute lung injury, transfection with an miR-16 overexpression virus was associated with an increased wet/dry ratio of lung tissue and higher NFkappa B levels compared to rats transfected with an empty vector (19). These finding suggests that benefits from the Hemopurifier in COVID-19 may extend beyond viral removal and may be a result of the elimination of mannosylated exosomes.\n\nThe second case is novel in that we demonstrate for the first time the in vivo removal of COVID\u221219 from the bloodstream in an infected patient by the Hemopurifier. We were able to elute COVID-19 from the used Hemopurifier cartridge as well as demonstrate a 58% reduction in plasma COVID-19 viral load following the single 6-h treatment. Unfortunately, this patient's disease was quite advanced at the onset of the Hemopurifier therapy, and he succumbed to multi-organ failure. It is possible that viral load reduction earlier in his course of COVID-19 might have provided a clinical benefit in this patient. In a study by Bermejo-Martin and colleagues, the presence of viremia was associated with a dysregulated immune response and development of coagulopathy (20). Post-mortem studies have demonstrated viral dissemination and seeding of organs including the bone marrow, heart, and gastrointestinal tract (21). In a Swedish cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients, the presence of viremia was associated with the need for renal replacement therapy and poor clinical outcome (22).\n\nIn summary, we describe the first two cases of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with the Hemopurifier lectin-affinity plasmapheresis cartridge. The two patients tolerated a total of nine 6-h Hemopurifier treatments without side effects. The first patient experienced a thrombus within the dialysis catheter at the beginning of the 1st Hemopurifier treatment which was likely precipitated by COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC). For the first time, we demonstrate the removal of COVID-19 from a viremic patient by the Hemopurifier. Additionally, total exosome concentrations and noxious exosomal microRNAs associated with coagulopathy and acute lung injury decreased with Hemopurifier treatments and was associated with clinical improvement in one patient.\n\nThe authors acknowledge limitations to our case series. The paper describes the treatment of only two patients with the Hemopurifier and lacks a control arm. In the 1st case where the patient improved from acute lung injury it should be acknowledged that a low tidal volume mechanical ventilation strategy was used. In a randomized clinical trial in patients with ARDS this mechanical ventilation strategy was shown to improve mortality (23). We examined only a limited number of microRNAs which could impact the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection in our present study. As an example, we did not measure the concentration on miR-98-5p which inhibits the expression of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which has been implicated in the pathogenicity of COVID-19 (24). Important unanswered questions regarding the Hemopurifier cartridge include the optimal timing of the intervention as well as the number and duration of Hemopurifier sessions necessary to see a benefit during COVID-19 infection. An IDE safety and feasibility study enrolling up to 40 ICU patients with COVID-19 (NCT04595903) is currently underway.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\nEthics Statement\n\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Scripps Mercy Chula Vista Hospital and Hoag Hospital Newport Beach.

On physical examination, the patient had significant facial edema. Nasal fiber-optic visualization revealed extensive airway edema involving the supraglottic region and the arytenoids. The patient was successfully intubated through the collective teamwork of ENT, anesthesia, and critical care teams. He was managed in the intensive care unit until recovery. Workup for markers for allergic causes of angioedema were within normal limits. Further investigation revealed that symptoms developed following the initiation of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) inhibitor. The angiotensin-converting enzyme and DPP-IV play a significant role in the metabolism of bradykinin and substance P to their inactive metabolites. The complex interplay between the enzymes in the high-molecular-weight kininogen (HWMK) system may increase the risk of angioedema in patients with a known history of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema when placed on a DPP-IV inhibitor. This case report highlights the pathophysiology involved.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nPostmarketing surveillance reports show that the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) inhibitor is associated with angioedema development. Angioedema occurs as a result of an allergic or nonallergic reaction to the medication. Although a rare adverse effect, the DPP-IV inhibitor\u2013associated angioedema could be severe and life-threatening. Nonallergic angioedema results due to a disruption in the high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) system.\n\nEnzymes including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), and DPP-IV works to metabolize bradykinin and substance P.\n\nThe complex interplay of the enzymes on the HMWK system may result in an increased risk of angioedema when medications inhibit the pathway like ACE inhibitors and DPP-IV inhibitors.\n\nCase Presentation\n\nThe patient was a 69-year-old male with a past medical history of intellectual disability, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department (ED) with difficulty breathing and tongue swelling. The patient lived in a group home that provided the skilled support he needed for day-to-day activities.\n\nThe patient was transferred due to acute difficulty breathing, accompanied by facial swelling. His symptoms started an hour before the presentation.\n\nInitial vital signs in the ED revealed a temperature of 99 \u00b0F, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 164/88 mm Hg, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) 98% on room air.\n\nOn physical examination, the patient had significant facial and tongue edema resulting in tongue protrusion. The airway was difficult to visualize as a result of the edema. Cardiac examination was unremarkable, with S1/S2 present and absent murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The abdomen was soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds. His extremities also showed equal pulses bilaterally.\n\nThe nasal fiber-optic visualization revealed severe edema of the supraglottis, arytenoids, and aryepiglottic folds resulting in airway obstruction. The patient was transferred to the operating room for emergent intubation.\n\nIn the operating room, an endotracheal tube was inserted through the right naris to the level of the oropharynx with the aid of a fiber-optic scope. The fiber-optic scope was placed in the endotracheal tube as it was inserted through the true vocal cords, visualized between the severely edematous aryepiglottic folds and arytenoids. The endotracheal tube was then passed over the laryngoscope into the trachea and secured.\n\nFollowing successful nasotracheal intubation, the patient was placed on a ventilator and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.\n\nThe patient was started on intravenous fluid hydration, methylprednisolone, and epinephrine to decrease angioedema. Bloodwork for serum levels of C1 inhibitor, tryptase, and histamine was performed to evaluate the origin of the patient\u2019s angioedema. Results revealed C1 inhibitor, tryptase, and histamine levels within normal ranges.\n\nFurther discussion with the group home staff revealed that the patient had a similar episode 2 years ago. He was brought to the hospital and received supportive treatment. During that hospitalization, allergic reaction markers were not elevated. His angioedema was suspected to be a result of ACE inhibitor medication, which was recently prescribed at the time. His symptoms resolved following discontinuation, and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up.\n\nThe group home staff also described that patient recently started on sitagliptin\u2014a DPP-IV inhibitor for better glycemic control.\n\nGiven this new information, sitagliptin was discontinued, and management continued in the ICU.\n\nThe patient remained intubated until he had a positive leak test, suggestive of a marked reduction in airway edema. Sedatives were titrated off, and he was extubated once alert, responsive, and low rapid shallow breathing index of 40.\n\nThe patient\u2019s hospitalization was complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia, which resolved with antibiotic treatment. He was then transferred to the medical floor, from where he was discharged with instructions to avoid the use of DPP-IV inhibitor and ACE inhibitor and a medical appointment for outpatient follow-up.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAngioedema is tissue edema that occurs as a result of increased vascular permeability. 1 It is a severe and fatal adverse reaction associated with several medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and ACE inhibitors.\n\nThe angioedema effect from ACE inhibitors has been well documented for years. It occurs due to substance P and bradykinin accumulation as a consequence of the direct inhibition of the ACE.\n\nIn the HMWK system, the ACE and NEP are essential enzymes in the metabolism of bradykinin and substance P. 2 However, the system is redundant as several other enzymes metabolize both bradykinin and substance P, though to a lesser extent.1,2\n\nThe level of activities of these various enzymes on bradykinin and substance P vary. Some have a higher affinity for bradykinin with less affinity for substance P and vice versa. For instance, enzymes like DPP-IV metabolize both substance P and bradykinin. Its main activity is on substance P, sequentially cleaving it to SP3-11, and SP5-11, less potent metabolites.1,3 However, the DPP-IV metabolism of bradykinin is minor.\n\nThe DPP-IV inhibitors are a class of medications used for glycemic control in diabetic patients.4,5 They work by inhibiting the degradation of incretin (like GLP-1 and GIP), which usually stimulate insulin release from the pancreas. 5\n\nPostmarketing reports show that gliptins, particularly sitagliptin, are associated with an increased risk of angioedema.6,7 The mechanism is a result of an allergic reaction, nonallergic reaction, or both. In allergic angioedema, allergic reaction markers like histamine and tryptase are elevated. Our patient\u2019s normal levels of serum histamine and tryptase levels ruled out angioedema of allergic origin.\n\nConversely, nonallergic angioedema results from the disruption of the metabolism of vasoactive substances like bradykinin and substance P, resulting in angioedema.8-10\n\nPatients on DPP-IV inhibitors have an increased risk of angioedema due to the accumulation of substance P and bradykinin. This risk is further increased when patients are concurrently on DPP-IV inhibitors and ACE inhibitors.8,11\n\nOur patient\u2019s case is unique in that he initially developed angioedema following exposure to an ACE inhibitor. However, his angioedema reoccurred after a DPP-IV inhibitor was initiated.\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been hypothesized as to why this could occur. Reports show that the sera of patients with a history of ACE inhibitor\u2013associated angioedema compared with that of patients on ACE inhibitor without angioedema have an innate decrease in DPP-IV enzyme activity in these patients.8,12,13\n\nAdditionally, Beaudouin et al show that serum levels of ACE, aminopeptidase P, and carboxypeptidase N decreased to 17%, 42%, and 64%, respectively, of reference range values and remained chronically inhibited for at least a year after the inhibition by DPPIV and ACE inhibitors.8,14 The chronic inhibition from a history of ACE inhibitor exposure combined with possible innate enzyme deficiency further increases bradykinin and substance P levels, thus increasing the risk of angioedema.14,15\n\nConsequently, given these different pathophysiologies, patients with a history of angioedema from either an ACE inhibitor or DPP-IV inhibitor could be at risk of recurring angioedema when subsequently initiated on either medication.16-18\n\nTherefore, a history of angioedema from either ACE or DPP-IV inhibitors could potentially be predictive of an increased risk of recurrence.19-21\n\nTreatment of angioedema is mainly supportive; corticosteroids and epinephrine help decrease inflammation and edema. Intubation should also be considered for airway protection in cases of severe angioedema.\n\nGiven the high mortality rate associated with angioedema, early recognition and management are crucial to improving outcomes.\n\nConclusion and Learning Points\n\nPatients with a history of ACE inhibitor angioedema may be at risk of recurring angioedema when placed on a DPP-IV inhibitor. Careful monitoring of these patients is essential to decrease the fatality rate from angioedema. Permanent cessation of these medications may be necessary to mitigate the future risk of angioedema.\n\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nFunding: The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nEthics Approval: Our institution does not require ethical approval for reporting individual cases or case series.\n\nInformed Consent: Verbal informed consent was obtained from the patient for their anonymized information to be published in this article.\n\nORCID iD: Chidinma Ejikeme https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1989-9779",

There is rising concern that patients who recover from COVID-19 may be at risk of reinfection. Another potential concern is the uncommon clinical scenario of a patient having persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA test over 3 months after the initial COVID-19 infection, as the patient presented. Whether presenting as a long-term infection (12 weeks) or reinfection, patients with COVID-19 will continue to have a severe inflammatory and prothrombotic state that could carry potential life-threatening thrombosis.\n\nTEXT:\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs a novel coronavirus, information regarding persistent or reinfection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the pandemic is limited. Further, data on the effects of prolonged or recurrent viremia in patients with thrombophilia are scarce. This case report presents this unusual but clinically relevant scenario and highlights the critical need for further investigation in this setting.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nA 33-year-old truck driver, male patient who developed symptoms of fever, chills, and dry cough in the month of March 2020. He was evaluated in an urgent care in the state of Florida. A few days prior to developing symptoms, the patient had been in New York City delivering a truck load. His nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive on March 28, 2020. He was advised by the Florida Department of Health to self-isolate for 14 days and did so at their recommendation. The patient subsequently improved in 5 days. He did not undergo repeat testing at 14 days. The patient did not receive medications after obtaining results 5 days later as his symptoms had already resolved. On June 06, 2020, he presented to a hospital in Georgia due to right lower extremity pain. He was diagnosed with extensive right iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis. The patient underwent US access of right popliteal vein, venogram of the right lower extremity, chemical thrombolysis, and percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy. The patient was discharged on apixaban.\n\nThe patient was evaluated in the ED at our institution on June 26, 2020, due to complains of bilateral lower extremity swelling. Lower extremity US disclosed bilateral extensive deep venous thrombosis. The patient reported being compliant in taking apixaban as prescribed. He denied fever, chills, viral prodrome, cough, dyspnea, or exposure sick persons. On physical examination, vital signs were normal with oxyhemoglobin saturation of 98% on room air. The only positive finding on physical examination was bilateral lower extremity swelling with evidence of edema. A repeat nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test done on June 28, 2020 was again positive. The admission inflammatory markers were elevated including C-reactive protein 6.59 mg/dL, ferritin 1283 ng/ml, and lactate dehydrogenase of 473 IU/L. Quantitative D-dimer was 35200 ng/dL. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram chest was negative for pulmonary embolism. The CT scan of the chest disclosed clear lungs.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody collected on 07/08/2020 was positive \u22651.4. In order to try to understand if the patient was reinfected after 12 weeks of his initial COVID-19 infection diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 IgM Antibody was ordered on July 7, 2020 and was negative. During this 3-month period, the patient was unaware of infecting any close contacts. Since the patient had no pulmonary complaints and did not require oxygen therapy at this visit, he did not receive steroids or antivirals.\n\nThe patient was started on anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin drip. He was evaluated by interventional radiology and underwent bilateral lower extremity venogram and placement of bilateral thrombolysis infusion catheters from the superficial femoral veins into the inferior vena cava. Hypercoagulable work up showed that the patient has a heterozygous factor V Leiden. Subsequently, the patient developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with both positive PF4-heparin antibody and serotonin release assay. The patient was discharged on Fondaparinux. He continued to follow as outpatient in the hematology clinic. Since the RT-PCR has a high specificity, the test was not repeated a third time.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe WHO characterized COVID-19 infection as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 was initially recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. One of the most important diagnostic tools to detect the infection is the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test. It has been noticed that in some cases viral RNA has been detected by RT-PCR even beyond week 6 following the first positive test.[1] There are also reported cases of recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the convalescent period.[2] The patient described has a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test after 12 weeks of initial diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.\n\nClinical recurrences of COVID-19 symptoms have been reported after recovery, most described as pneumonia.[34] The patient described was found to have extensive deep venous thrombosis 3 months after his initial COVID-19 infection, with significant elevation in inflammatory markers and thrombophilia. This type of presentation along with a repeated positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test raises one more time the question of reinfection versus viral relapse.\n\nCOVID-19 infection can be detected indirectly by measuring IgM and IgG. ELISA-based IgM and IgG antibody tests have greater than 95% specificity for diagnosis of COVID-19. In the confirmed patients with COVID-19, sensitivity of IgM is 77.3% and negative predictive value is 80%.[5] Our patient had a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and positive IgG. The IgM was negative despite of the significantly elevated inflammatory markers and clinical thrombosis (thrombophilia). It is not completely clear whether the negative IgM represented a false negative result. Further research including the potential measurement of quantitative viral load could be beneficial to answer this question.\n\nThis is the first report of positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test 3 months after an initial diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 results in a unique, profoundly prothrombotic milieu leading to both arterial and venous thrombosis.[6] Thrombotic events have been observed in outpatients with COVID-19 infection, but data on the incidence are not available. Whether presenting as a potential long-term infection (up to 3 months as this case) or reinfection, patients with COVID-19 will continue to have a severe inflammatory and prothrombotic state that could carry potential life-threatening thrombosis.\n\nInformed consent was obtained from this patient to present this case report.

This is the first case report in the published literature to describe the diagnosis and management of a patient with both conditions.\nA 49-year-old female with a history of HOCM and recently diagnosed scleroderma presented to the clinic with progressive dyspnoea. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction at rest, and elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressure.

Initial history and examination were remarkable for prior Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, a crescendo systolic murmur that increased with the Valsalva manoeuvre and hand telangectasias without sclerodactyly. The patient had been diagnosed with obstructive HOCM 6\u2009years earlier and was treated with metoprolol succinate 100\u2009mg daily and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention. She was recently referred to a rheumatologist for evaluation of possible scleroderma.\n\nTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with a maximal septal thickness of 2.2\u2009cm (Figure\u00a01), systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve (Video 1), and a dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 56\u2009mmHg at rest and 125\u2009mmHg with Valsalva (Figure\u00a02). Right ventricular (RV) function was mildly reduced, and the pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure was estimated at 75\u2009mmHg. Subsequently, left and right cardiac catheterization (RHC) revealed normal coronary arteries, provocable LVOT gradient of 150\u2009mmHg, PA pressure of 88/32 (52) mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 12\u2009mmHg, transpulmonary gradient (TPG) 40, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 14.8 Woods units (Wu), and a cardiac index (CI) of 1.6\u2009L/min/m2. Anti-centromere antibodies were positive. Computed tomography of the lungs, pulmonary function tests, and a ventilation-perfusion scan were unremarkable.\n\nFigure 1 Parasternal long-axis view demonstrating septal thickness.\n\nFigure 2 Apical three-chambers view demonstrating Doppler estimation of the provocable left ventricular outflow tract gradiet during valsalva manoeuvre.\n\nThe differential diagnosis included combined pre- and post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) from her longstanding HOCM, with the scleroderma features being incidental. Alternatively, limited scleroderma involving the pulmonary vasculature and contributing to her PH was considered.\n\nThe patient was started on tadalafil but this was stopped because of increased dyspnoea and gastric reflux symptoms. Surgical myectomy was considered but given the increased risk in the presence of severe PH, the decision was made to proceed with alcohol septal ablation (ASA). Over the months following the ASA, the patient had a modest initial improvement in her symptoms, but then the dyspnoea worsened. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed 6\u2009months after ASA showed significant improvement of the provocable and resting gradients across the LVOT. To further optimize her prior to starting PAH-specific medications, her ICD was reprogrammed to pace the RV apex to induce left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony, which led to abolition of the resting LVOT gradient, and further reduction of the provocable gradient to 32\u2009mmHg.\n\nGiven the resolution of gradients, it was felt that her dyspnoea was due to progression of scleroderma-associated World Health Organization (WHO) 1 PAH. Repeated RHC showed a PA pressure mean 61\u2009mmHg, PVR 34.1 Wu, and CI 1\u2009L/min/m2 in the setting of a PCWP of 4\u2009mmHg. Vasodilatory testing with nitric oxide (NO) showed improvement in the PA mean pressure 56\u2009mmHg, PVR 20.9 Wu, and CI 1.4\u2009L/min/m2, and minimal increase of the PCWP (6\u2009mmHg). However, the improvement in the patient\u2019s haemodynamics did not meet the threshold for considering calcium channel blocker treatment (non-responder). She was subsequently started on intravenous treprostinil, a direct vasodilator acting through the prostacyclin pathway, and macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist. The combination therapy of treprostinil and macitentan was well tolerated by the patient. Three months after initiation of PAH-specific medication, she reports a significant improvement in dyspnoea and overall energy. Follow-up TTE demonstrated improved PA systolic pressure from 76 to 63 mmHg and improved RV function, with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion increasing from 1.4 to 1.8\u2009cm. Accordingly, the treprostinil dose was uptritrated from 25 to 45\u2009ng/kg/min.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is the most common genetic cardiac condition with a prevalence of up to 1:200 in the general population.1 Up to two-thirds of HCM patients show evidence of dynamic LVOT obstruction related to SAM of the mitral valve with septal contact.2 Obstructive physiology and diastolic dysfunction can lead to progressive heart failure symptoms. In several series of HCM patients, a PA systolic pressure >35\u2009mmHg, has been identified in 18\u201338% of patients, with higher prevalence seen in the obstructive HCM phenotype.3,4 Interestingly, in one series, 9% of the HCM patients with PH had a PCWP \u226415\u2009mmHg with high PVR, raising the possibility of co-existent combined pre and post-capillary PH.5 PH was found to be an independent predictor of HCM morbidity3 and mortality4 in non-obstructive and obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients who did not undergo septal reduction therapy (SRT).\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension WHO group 1 is a rare condition with a prevalence of 15\u201350 cases per million.6 It is defined as a mean PA pressure \u226525\u2009mmHg, a PCWP <15\u2009mmHg, and a PVR of >3 Wu. Pulmonary arterial hypertension has complex pathophysiology characterized by an imbalance of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator peptides leading to remodelling of the pulmonary arterioles. Pulmonary arterial hypertension can be associated with connective tissue disease, especially in scleroderma patients, with a prevalence of up to 19%.7 The prognosis of scleroderma associated PAH is poor with 3-year survival of approximately 60%.8\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with concurrent HOCM and WHO group 1 PAH-scleroderma, two disease states that are rising in prevalence due to heightened awareness and screening. Although PH had been reported in patients with HOCM (WHO group 2), a very high TPG and PVR should raise the possibility of another contributing process.\n\nThe haemodynamic interaction of these two pathologies poses several challenges. While several vasoactive agents are indicated in the treatment of WHO group 1 PAH, vasodilation of the pulmonary arterioles in the setting of elevated left atrial pressure due to LVOT obstruction and diastolic dysfunction from HOCM can lead to pulmonary oedema. Paradoxically, increased pre-load to the left ventricle as a result of PAH medications could potentially improve SAM and LVOT obstruction and decrease the PCWP. In this case, the use of pulmonary arterial vasodilators (tadalafil) prior to optimization of HOCM physiology lead to significant dyspnoea and early discontinuation of the medication.\n\nHCM-related LVOT obstruction that is resistant to medical therapy can be relieved by SRT. These treatments also improve diastolic dysfunction in patients with HOCM over time.9 Surgical myectomy is the preferred approach in most young patients, particularly with massive LVH and very large gradients. In this case, severe PH made induction of general anaesthesia high risk for acute haemodynamic collapse. In addition, a minimally invasive SRT, as in ASA, is more reasonable in patients with concomitant PAH and limited life expectancy.\n\nOptimization of her HOCM physiology alone was not associated with improvement in dyspnoea, suggesting that her scleroderma-associated severe PAH was contributing to her progressive symptoms. The NO challenge administered during the RHC, 6\u2009months after optimization of the HOCM physiology, decreased PA pressure and increased CI without increasing the PCWP. NO is a potent pulmonary arterial vasodilator that increases PA flow to the left ventricle. The lack of significant elevation of PCWP after the NO challenge reflects the success of the ASA in relieving the LVOT obstruction, and normalization of the left atrial and the diastolic LV pressures. The NO challenge helped predict that the patient is likely to tolerate PAH medications and the associated increase in the PA flow. Therefore, the ASA was pivotal in improving the LV ability to tolerate increases in preload from pulmonary vasodilator treatment. Frequent assessment of her symptoms will be necessary, as there may come a point where the improved PVR may lead to eventual elevated PCWP and shortness of breath, requiring augmented diuretics. An additional practical consideration in patients with severe PH and RV dysfunction is that they may not tolerate beta-blockers. However, in her case, some degree of negative chronotropy and contractility may be necessary for any residual LVOT gradient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis case describes the management dilemma in caring for patients that have two uncommon, yet increasingly recognized diseases. Since the prognosis of untreated PAH-scleroderma is very poor, a multidisciplinary treatment approach is needed to rapidly and safely optimize the background of HCM with obstruction in order to permit the use of PAH-specific medications.\n\nLead author biography\n\nAhmed Hassanin, MD, MPH is a cardiovascular disease fellow at Westchester Medical Center in New York.

It can be associated with the development of autoimmune diseases being more prevalent among adults though the exact pathophysiology is not fully defined. In this paper, we report the case of a young patient suffering from nephrotic syndrome secondary to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis associated with IgAD. To the best of our knowledges, this is the first report of such association in a young adult.\n\nCase Presentation\n\nOn December 2013, a 19-year-old man was referred to our Unit due to the sudden development of nephrotic syndrome manifesting with leg edema and ascites. Blood arterial pressure was 140/70 mmHg, heart rate 70 bpm, and body weight 74.5 kg. Renal ultrasound showed kidney enlargement and cortical hyperechogenicity. Laboratory tests revealed reduced renal function (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, urea 38 mg/dL), hypoproteinemia (4.1 g/dl), hypoalbuminaemia (1.96 g/dL), and dyslipidemia (total cholesterol 290 mg/dL, triglycerides 250 mg/dL). Urinalysis documented heavy proteinuria (300 mg/dL) with microhematuria and leucocyturia. Immunological investigations showed an isolated reduction of complement factor (C) 3 (26.7 mg/dl) and of immunoglobulin (Ig) G (447 mg/dL) and IgA (<7.8 mg/dL); C4, IgM, IgG subclasses, and IgE in the normal range; negative search for ANA, ENA, c-ANCA, p-ANCA, thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin antibodies, HBV and HCV serologic analyses. We performed a percutaneous kidney biopsy that revealed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (Figure 1) associated with a marked immunostaining positivity for C3 in a diffuse granular manner and mild mesangial segmental focal total IgG positivity. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone, 60 mg i.v. for 1 week, followed by 64 mg per os, and with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) lisinopril (20 mg/day), until February 2014, when he was readmitted due to weight gain (79 kg). We resumed methylprednisolone iv therapy for 7 days, followed by methylprednisolone 32 mg per os. During hospitalization, normalization of kidney function was achieved (serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, serum urea 35 mg/dL) with persistence of proteinuria (dipstick 300 mg/dL). Partial remission was observed in June 2014, and methylprednisolone therapy was gradually tapered until suspension in September 2014. Molecular analyses of the complement CFH, CFI, MCP, C3, CFB genes were also performed. As regards to factor H (which is composed of 20 SCR, Short Consensus Repeat), mutation screening was carried out by next-generation sequencing: no mutations were identified in any SCRs 1\u201320, in the gene promoter or in the signal peptide. As regards factor B, screening for mutations by next-generation sequencing was carried out in the 18 exons that make up the CFB gene and no mutation was identified. Regarding factor I, screening was conducted in the 13 exons that make up the CFI gene and no mutation was identified, as was found for the 41 exons that make up the C3 gene.\n\nFrom December 2014 until September 2016, at follow-up checks we found normal kidney function (creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, urea 32 mg/dL), mild hypoproteinemia (6.2 g/dL), a mild C3 reduction (78.6 mg/dl), and proteinuria (30\u201350 mg/dL). At that time the patient was on therapy with ACEi only.\n\nIn October 2016, we again observed reduced kidney function (creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, urea 26 mg/dL) associated with an increase in proteinuria (at dipstick, 150 mg/dL), hypoproteinemia (5.9 g/dL) and C3 reduction (79 mg/dL). Thus, in the light of these data, methylprednisolone 32 mg per os was started again, and gradually tapered until August 2017. However, despite the steroid therapy, we observed a further deterioration of kidney function (creatinine values progressively increasing from 1.5 mg/dl to 2.2 mg/dl) associated with persistence of proteinuria and C3 reduction. Hence, we readmitted our patient and in January 2019 performed a second kidney biopsy (Figure 2), which disclosed disease progression with presence of sclerosis (4/14 glomeruli) and a marked diffuse immunostaining positivity for C3, like the previous biopsy. Electron microscopy confirmed the diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (Figure 3). We decided to restart methylprednisolone therapy 32 mg, which the patient continued for six months before it was progressively reduced until definitive suspension. The latest kidney function values show creatinine 2.5 mg/dL, proteinuria (100 mg/dl).\n\nSince this was a retrospective case report in which the patient was not identified, the requirement for institutional approval to publish the case details was waived. Written informed consent from the patient for publication of the study was obtained. Figure 1 Kidney biopsy performed in 2013.

IgA deficiency patients are often asymptomatic and diagnosis is incidental. However, the defect may be associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections, malignancies (particularly of gastrointestinal tract and lymphoid) and autoimmune diseases.1 Autoimmunity is more prevalent in adults (median age 29 years) and in females. There is reported to be an increased percentage of autoantibodies in children suffering from IgAD without necessarily any clinical manifestations.2 However, preexisting selective IgAD significantly contribute to the development of two different autoimmune disorders (type 1 diabetes, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) complicating SARS-Cov-2 infection.3 Moreover, Naito et al observed that the frequency of selective IgAD has a strong positive correlation with the prevalence of COVID-19 per population.4\n\nOur discussion focuses on kidney diseases, especially glomerular diseases, associated with IgAD.\n\nIgAD and Glomerulonephritis in Children and Adolescents\n\nIn children and adolescents, there are few reports about glomerulonephritis and IgAD. Liu et al described a child with nephrotic syndrome secondary to diffuse and generalized mesangiopathic glomerulonephritis and a medical history of asthma, chronic otitis media and IgAD.5 Kawasaki et al described a child suffering from nephrotic syndrome secondary to diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis stage 1 and IgAD.6 Ichikawa et al reported a probably multimodal autoimmune disorder producing juvenile alopecia, autoimmune encephalitis (Rasmussen syndrome) and membranous nephropathy, based on congenital IgAD.7 Again, Martini et al reported the case of a 9-year-old girl with clinical signs and symptoms resembling Henoch-Schonlein syndrome and IgAD, the renal biopsy indicating mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with diffuse granular deposits of C3 on immunofluorescence without IgA. However, the authors believed that this case represented an unusual variant of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis characterized by mild systemic vasculitis.8\n\nRecently, Di Genova et al reported 2 cases of children suffering from nephrotic syndrome and IgAD, not biopsied due to ethical issues associated with severe relapses during corticosteroid therapy. However, these patients obtained a positive outcome with human monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab and ofatumumab, respectively).9 The most recent case refers to a 5-year-old girl with selective IgAD and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis related to streptococcal infection and treated with benefit multidrug therapy.10\n\nIgAD and Glomerulonephritis in Adults\n\nThe association between glomerulonephritis and IgAD is better documented in adults. It is supposed that IgAD, which predisposes to infections, may contribute to the onset of glomerulonephritis, especially in chronic infectious patients.11 There are also reports of elevated levels of circulating immune complexes containing IgG and IgM, which may mediate some cases of vasculitis. A review by Huang et al reported 18 cases of glomerulonephritis associated with IgAD: the most common renal pathology associated with IgAD is mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.12 Camilleri et al reported the case of a 59 years old woman with IgAD associated with oligoarthritis and glomerulonephritis mediated by immune complexes.13 John et al reported a case of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis in a 55-year-old woman with IgAD and serum antinuclear antibodies who presented with nephrotic syndrome without a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.14 Also described is a case of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis in a Japanese woman who had been diagnosed with IgAD 12 years previously; however, the patient had also been diagnosed with generalized epilepsy and received phenytoin and valproic acid for at least 15 years, which are known to cause IgAD.15\n\nThe pathogenesis of glomerular diseases in IgAD is still poorly understood. In our case, we did not find direct evidence of a pathogenic linkage between IgAD and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. One may only speculate on an association with circulating immune complexes, which are present in 50\u201360% of patients with selective IgAD.16\n\nConclusions\n\nAs far as we know, there is one sole case in the literature reporting an association between immunoglobulin deficiency and a mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis pattern: this is a 55-year-old man presenting with a fainting attack.17 By contrast, our patient presented only IgAD, IgG reduction being related to nephrotic syndrome. Our patient has no causes of secondary IgAD; moreover, we twice sampled IgA titers, in 2013 and 2019, and we found them very low on both occasions. He had a mild response to corticosteroid therapy but no infectious diseases during this therapy, as one might expect due to IgAD.\n\nDisclosure\n\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.",

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nExtravasation of Epirubicin chemotherapy from a port-a-cath causing extensive breast necrosis: Sequential imaging findings and management of a breast cancer patient.\n\nABSTRACT:\nExtravasation of chemotherapy is rare with an estimated incidence of 0.01%-7% but can cause significant morbidity, delay in cancer treatment and potential mortality. We present a case of 55-year-old woman with a metastatic right axillary lymph node with no identifiable breast primary, commenced on chemotherapy as per multidisciplinary team decision. Extravasation of 25 mls of Epirubicin chemotherapy at the porta-a-cath (site) caused extensive inflammatory change in the breast parenchyma and chest wall with a necrotic ulcerating skin-defect. Even with ensuring port or peripheral catheter patency and position, extravasation can occur. This is the first case report to describe the use of MRI to help plan management, identifying the extent of the tissue damage and vascular compromise which could impair healing. In this case the necrotic ulcer was managed with surgical debridement and human ADM matrix (Matriderm dermal matrix) which has not been described in the literature previously.\n\nTEXT:\npmcCase report\n\nA 55-year-old woman attended the accident and emergency department at a tertiary referral centre with extensive skin necrosis of the right breast and was referred to the Breast Unit for management.\n\nShe had initially presented to a regional hospital three weeks prior, with a one-month history of a mass in the right axilla. Clinical examination at that time identified a 40 mm mobile axillary mass with normal breast examination. Digital mammograms identified a 30 mm well defined dense rounded mass overlying the right axilla (M3), only partially imaged on the medial lateral oblique view (Fig.\u00a01). Ultrasound (US) of the right axilla confirmed a well-defined lobulated hypoechoic mass 45 mm x 31 mm in keeping with a right level one axillary lymph node which was suspicious for malignancy (U4) (Fig.\u00a02). Histology of the US guided core biopsy (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016 gauge) of the axilla identified a metastatic lymph node of ductal carcinoma type, grade 3, oestrogen receptor (ER) positive (8/8), progesterone receptor (PR) positive (8/8) and Herceptin 2 receptor positive.Fig. 1 A: Right MLO mammogram identified a 30 mm well defined dense rounded mass overlying the right axilla (M3). B: The mass was not identified on the CC view as too posterior and superior on this view. No mass identified on the CC view as the mass was too posterior and superior.\n\nFig 1\n\nFig. 2 Right axilla US of a well-defined lobulated hypoechoic mass 45 mm x 31 mm in keeping with a right level one axillary lymph node U4.\n\nFig 2\n\nTo determine if there was an occult breast cancer, a dynamic contrast enhanced breast MRI was performed, but the MRI did not demonstrate abnormal enhancement in either breast, confirming only a solitary enlarged right level one axillary lymph node in keeping with biopsy-proven axillary metastatic disease (Fig.\u00a03).Fig. 3 (A): T2W MRI confirmed the right unifocal level one axillary mass (white arrow). (B): Dynamic post contrast fat saturated breast MRI with no suspicious enhancement identified in the breast.\n\nFig 3\n\nA right port-a-cath had been inserted one day prior to chemotherapy with no complications recorded and an image intensifier image confirmed the correct location of the venous line placement, with the tip projected over the superior vena cava (Fig.\u00a04). On the first day of neoadjuvant chemotherapy after administration of 25 mls of Epirubicin the patient experienced pain at the port-a-cath site and chest wall and the infusion was stopped as it was recognised that the drug had been delivered outside the port-a-cath. The extravasation was managed expectantly without saline washout, surgical intervention or the use of an antidote.Fig. 4 Image intensifier image of the post placement of the right port-a-cath with the tip overlying the superior vena cava and the line appearing intact.\n\nFig 4:\n\nFig. 5 (A): STIR sequence of the post extravasation breast MRI. There was extensive high signal intensity oedema of the pectoralis muscles bilaterally (long white arrows), extensive oedema and skin thickening of the right breast (short white arrow) and mild medial skin thickening and oedema of the left medial breast (asterix). (B): STIR images with the extent of the high signal intensity inflammatory changes extending on to the lower chest wall (short white left arrow) and long the right lateral chest wall and serratus anterior (long white arow).\n\nFig 5\n\nThe left upper chest wall (and contiguous breast) became increasingly painful, red and swollen; four days later an MRI was performed to identify the extent of the tissue damage from the extravasated chemotherapy and to guide decision making regarding the need for tissue debridement and/ or mastectomy.\n\nOnly limited images without contrast were obtained due to the patient's chest wall pain, but this identified extensive oedema of the pectoralis muscles bilaterally, extensive oedema of the breast parenchyma and skin of the right breast and mild medial skin oedema of the left medial breast (Fig.\u00a05). Due to the degree of inflammatory changes, she was prescribed high dose oral steroids, oral morphine and skin dressings.\n\nAt the tertiary center, there was a joint assessment by a plastic surgeon and oncological breast surgeon. She was noted to have a BMI of 47 with a prior history of hypothyroidism and congenital heart defect. Examination identified the entire chest wall was inflamed with extensive necrosis of the breast and eschar formation typical for consequences of an extravasation injury (Fig.\u00a06).\n\nThe following challenges were identified at this time: the patient had an aggressive breast cancer in the right axillary lymph nodes adjacent to an area of skin necrosis, no effective treatment had been started 10 weeks following the initial presentation, a surgical axillary clearance in an area of compromised skin and soft tissues had the potential to result in further extensive breakdown and the patient had a BMI of 47, which can make surgery challenging.\n\nMultidisciplinary discussion recommended a further breast MRI to plan management. The post contrast MRI identified oedema and skin thickening of the right breast and the right pectoralis major and minor but normal enhancement of the vessels with the lateral thoracic, internal mammary, perforators and intercostal perforators all preserved. The right axillary mass was stable in size and no new breast or axillary lesions were identified (Fig.\u00a07).Fig. 6 (A) and (B): Clinical photographs of the right breast at presentation to the tertiary referral center, 3 weeks post extravasation injury.\n\nFig 6\n\nFig. 7 (A): Post contrast, fat saturated T1w image demonstrating skin thickening of the right breast (white arow heads), oedema of the right breast (short white arrow) and the right pectoralis major and minor (long white arrow). (B): Post contrast MIP images which demonstrated the intact vascularity of the breasts and internal mammary vessels (arrows).\n\nFig 7\n\nBased on the imaging demonstrating the lack of extensive breast necrosis or abscess, further conservative management was continued and Letrozole was initiated to start cancer treatment. A surgical wash out of the wound but no significant wound debridement was performed with removal of the port-a-cath. The surgeon did not identify any break in the line and the venous catheter was a fully intact on inspection.\n\nTreatment with Paclitaxel, Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab with Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) cover was commenced four weeks later (delayed by wound infection and fever). Wound management continued with input from the tissue viability service and a vacuum dressing applied once the chemotherapy restarted. It was felt by the plastic surgeons in the Oncoplastic MDT that since no cancer had been identified in the breast and the ulcer was contiguous with the axillary metastasis, topical negative pressure therapy (vacuum dressing) was not contraindicated.\n\nFollowing completion of chemotherapy, the axillary mass clinically had not reduced significantly in size and therefore a breast MRI was performed to plan surgery and a PET-CT to exclude metastatic disease. The dynamic post contrast breast MRI identified partial response of the right axillary mass (from 45 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a031 mm to 37 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a026 mm) with no suspicious enhancement in the right breast. There was decreased skin thickening and decreased breast oedema with no significant oedema of the pectorialis muscles. The residual cavity in the upper inner right breast had reduced and was barely visible on MRI. There were no new suspicious lymph nodes. There was normal vascularity of the breast and chest wall (Fig.\u00a08) further validating the MRI-guided decision not to perform debridement or resection of the breast tissue underlying the skin ulceration let alone perform a mastectomy.Fig. 8 (A), post contrast, fat saturated T1w image demonstrated partial response of the right axillary mass, decreased skin thickening, decreased breast oedema with no significant oedema of the pectoralis muscles (arrows). (B) demonstrates the normal vascularity of the breast and chest wall.\n\nFig 8\n\nPET-CT showed no evidence of distant metastases with only the axillary mass present and the skin defect from the port site (Fig.\u00a09). An axillary clearance was performed, and the skin defect in the right superior chest wall closed with human acellular dermal matrix (ADM, Matriderm dermal matrix from MedSkin Solutions, Germany) akin to a split skin graft (Fig.\u00a010). Final histopathology of the right axillary clearance identified 1 positive lymph node from a total of 21 lymph nodes with extensive infiltration of node with metastatic carcinoma measuring 24 mm, ER, PR, Herceptin 2 receptor positive. Further MDT discussion advised further oncological treatment consisting of a trial with trastuzumab emtansine and Zoledronic acid. The patient is currently well post-surgery and the treatment is ongoing for final wound closure with a meshed split skin graft of the ever-decreasing wound. It has been possible to preserve her breast which is no longer indurated, is soft and mobile.Fig. 9 18F-FDG PET-CT demonstrated avid uptake in the right axillary mass (short white arrow) with mild uptake around the remaining ulceration and defect in superior breast (long white arrow) due to granulation tissue.\n\nFig 9\n\nFig. 10 (A), pre-operative photograph of the skin necrosis and superior defect. (B), post- operative photograph of the oncoplastic procedure with acellular dermal matrix in situ.\n\nFig 10\n\nDiscussion\n\nExtravasation events detected during chemotherapy are well described in the literature with an estimated incidence of 0.01%-7% [1]. These can cause significant morbidity, delay to cancer treatment and potential mortality. Schulmeister describes four major mechanisms by which extravasation injury can occur: perforation, catheter fracture, incorrect needle placement and thrombus formation [2]. Extravasation is a serious complication of chemotherapeutic agents administered intravenously, and it is vital that signs of extravasation are recognized promptly and treated immediately. These signs include sensory changes, pain, swelling, blanching and erythema [3]. The consequences of extravasation can range from pain, delay in treatment, impairment of mobility and psychological distress from the extensive tissue damage. Certain patient factors may be associated with a greater risk of extravasation such as age, underlying vascular disease, and history of multiple intravenous therapies [3]. A high body mass index has been shown to be associated with all the patients that experienced extravasation in a study by Halsik [4].\n\nEpirubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy agent used commonly for the treatment of breast cancer, acting as a topoisomerase inhibitor. Anthracyclines are classified as DNA-binding vesicants and if extravasation occurs can induce large blisters and tissue injuries, leading to necrosis and ulceration [1].\n\nCentral venous access is used for administration of chemotherapy as it minimizes its toxic effects of extravasation [5]. Extravasation injury is rarer with central administration than peripheral routes [6] however, central venous devices such as Port-a-Cath have shown extravasation rates of up to 6% in the literature [4,7]. There have been several reports of extravasation with the use of central venous access devices with rates from 0.26% to 4.7% [8,9].\n\nThe most cohesive current guidelines on the treatment of extravasation are by the European Society of Medical Oncologists [1]. These suggest the best treatment is dictated by the class of chemotherapy agent. For vesicants early localisation with a cold compress every 20 minutes, four times a day for 24-48 hours and treatment ideally within 6 hours with intravenous dexrazoxane and topical Dimethyl sulfoxide [10]. This is reflected in several case reports where the systemic use of dexrazoxane has resulted in favorable outcomes during extravasation injury involving central venous catheters [11,12,13]. The earlier the extravasation is detected, the more beneficial interventions such as a surgical \u201cSubcutaneous Wash-Out Procedure\u201d are [14].\n\nMulti-center studies have shown that surgical treatment is the last resort, as timely treatment can prevent surgery in a large proportion of patients if intravenous infusion of dexrazoxane is given within 6 hours of the extravasation incident [15]. If the port removal is delayed, surgical management such as debridement and flap coverage may be required to manage the necrotic area [8,9]. Innovative techniques such as vacuum-sealing have also been described in the literature as per the case herein reported. This however has the potential to further stimulate tumor growth when used in the vicinity of a cancer [16].\n\nThis case illustrates that even after a small volume of epirubicin extravasation severe tissue damage can occur. The literature suggests that early administration of treatments as per ESMO guidelines can reduce the impact of the tissue damage. This is the first case report to describe the use of MRI to help plan management, identifying the extent of the tissue damage and vascular compromise which could impair healing. The serial MRIs also served to assess any progression in tissue damage and thus prevented potentially mutilating surgery (by radical debridement of necrotic tissue) or a mastectomy and the consequent need for flap reconstruction. This was especially important in someone who was a high surgical risk on account of her very high BMI. In this case the necrotic ulcer was managed with limited surgical debridement followed by dressing changes and topical negative pressure (vacuum therapy). Once the ulcerated area was clean and had no residual necrotic / sloughy tissue and had formed sufficient granulation tissue, the now superficial ulcer was resurfaced with human ADM matrix which has not been described in the literature previously. Although the take from this was less than ideal the patient went on to have skin grafting of a now favorable bed.\n\nIn conclusion clinicians must be aware of the grave implications of extravasation injuries to cancer patients and involve the multidisciplinary team, including radiology, to obtain the best outcomes.\n\nPatient consent\n\nPatient has agreed to a case report being written based on her images. This has been entered onto the patient records (EPIC) on the 15/10/2020.\n\nCompeting interests: Chien Lin Soh, Dr Penelope Moyle, Mr Parto Forouhi and Professor Charles Malata declare that they do not have any conflict of interest.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of metachronous gastric SCC occurring at three years after curative resection of pancreatic cancer.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is most frequently found in skin, head and neck region, oral cavity, esophagus, lung, cervix, and anus. Cells lining stomach and pancreas are glandular epithelium. Thus, adenocarcinoma is the most common histopathologic type. It has been reported in up to 90% of all gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer[1,2]. Gastric SCC is very rare, accounting for about 0.04% to 0.2% of all gastric carcinomas[3-5]. About 100 cases have been reported since its first report in 1905[6,7]. Pancreatic SCC is another rare neoplasm. About 50 cases have been reported, accounting for about 0.5% to 5% of all pancreatic neoplasms[8]. For both gastric SCC and pancreatic SCC, clinicopathologic characteristics and pathogenesis of are poorly understood. Therefore, currently there is no established standard treatment for them. The prognosis is known to be very poor for both gastric SCC and pancreatic SCC[6-8].\n\nMetachronous cancers are defined as those occurring more than 6 mo later after the first primary cancer. Since both pancreatic SCC and gastric SCC are very rare, there has been no report of metachronous occurrence of these cancers. Here, we report an unusual case of metachronous gastric SCC that occurring three years after the diagnosis of pancreatic SCC.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\n\nChief complaints\n\nA 75-year-old female with complaint of abdominal pain visited our hospital in August, 2015.\n\nHistory of present illness\n\nAbdominal pain was mainly located on the epigastric area which started three months ago accompanied by dyspepsia. She denied diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and fever.\n\nHistory of past illness\n\nThe patient had hypertension and diabetes. She had no history of surgery.\n\nPersonal and family history\n\nShe had no prior history of smoking or drinking alcohol. No family history was noted.\n\nPhysical examination\n\nHer vital sign was stable, with blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, and body temperature of 36.8 \u2103. Physical examination of the abdomen revealed sharp tenderness at the epigastric area.\n\nLaboratory examinations\n\nRoutine laboratory test showed slight elevation of white blood cell (13600/mm3), C-reactive protein (5.199 mg/dL), and tumor marker CA 19-9 (488 U/mL). Other laboratory test results were within reference ranges. Her aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels were also within reference ranges.\n\nImaging examinations\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scan was done to further evaluate the cause of pain. It revealed a 3.3 cm sized mass at the tail of the pancreas (Figure 1A). Under clinical impression of resectable pancreatic cancer, she underwent distal pancreatectomy. Histopathologic finding of the surgical specimen was moderately differentiated SCC with papillary growth pattern and clear resection margin (Figure 1B). Immunohistochemical staining showed that tumor cells were positive for p63 (Figure 1C) but negative for CK7 and CK20.\n\nFigure 1 Images of the pancreas. A: Computed tomography showing 3.3 cm sized mass (arrow) at the pancreas tail with enhancement; B: Hematoxylin & eosin stain of distal pancreas showing moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with papillary growth pattern (\u00d7 200); C: Tumor cells were diffuse positive for p63 by immunohistochemical staining (\u00d7 40).\n\nHospital course\n\nThe patient recovered without complications after surgery. She was discharged from our hospital. After discharge, she needed periodic outpatient follow-up to check for recurrence. However, she no longer visited the hospital.\n\nThree years later, in 2018, she received a gastroscopy for regular check-up at another hospital. She was referred to our hospital with clinical impression of gastric cancer. Gastroscopy showed a single, 2 cm sized, ill-defined irregular flat and hyperemic mass at the greater curvature side of high body with mucosa friability (Figure 2A). Biopsy was performed. Moderately differentiated SCC was noted in the biopsy specimen (Figure 2B). Tumor cells were positive for p63 (Figure 2C) but negative for CK7 and CK20. These histopathologic findings in the stomach were consistent with those of the pancreas that had previously undergone surgery. CT scan & positive emission tomography CT scan for staging work-up revealed multiple hepatic and peritoneal metastasis.\n\nFigure 2 Images of the stomach. A: Gastroscopy showing 2 cm sized ill-defined irregular flat and hyperemic mucosa at high body; B: Hematoxylin & eosin stain of stomach biopsy showing moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (\u00d7 200); C: Tumor cells were positive for p63 by immunohistochemical staining (\u00d7 100).\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS\n\nThe final diagnosis of the presented case was metachronous gastric SCC that occurred after the diagnosis of pancreatic SCC.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nUnder the clinical diagnosis of advanced stage gastric SCC, she received combination chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin.\n\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\nAfter receiving three cycles of combination chemotherapy, CT scan for response evaluation showed a stable disease. During additional chemotherapy, she wanted to stop the chemotherapy due to chemotherapy induced mucositis and general weakness. Since then, she received conservative treatment for symptom control. She died 6 mo later in 2019 from disease progression.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIt has been suggested that patients diagnosed with one type of cancer have higher likelihood of developing another type of cancer compared to the general population[9]. Although the reason is yet to be identified, factors to be considered include more frequent screening methods, recent improvement of imaging modalities, exposure to radiotherapy and hormonal therapy, environmental factors, and genetic factors. We report the first case of metachronous gastric SCC following pancreatic SCC.\n\np63 is a known marker of squamous differentiation. It is normally found in progenitor cells of stratified epithelia. Expression of p63 is diffuse in SCC. Pancreatic SCC is a rare neoplasm accounting for up to 5% of pancreatic neoplasms[3-5]. The pathogenesis of pancreatic SCC is unclear. Proposed theories include squamous metaplasia from chronic inflammation leading to malignant transformation, transition from previous adenocarcinoma to SCC, or arising from precursor progenitor cell[8]. Although there is no standardized treatment for pancreatic SCC, treatment options include surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy[10]. The biologic behavior of pancreatic SCC from published literature highlights its propensity to affect elderly patients, metastasis at the time of diagnosis, poor response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and an extremely short survival period[11]. Several studies have suggested an improved survival with chemotherapeutic agents using a combination of 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and vinblastine, gemcitabine, or nanosomal paclitaxel[11-14]. Prognosis still remains dismal with most cases undergoing dissemination at the time of diagnosis. The median overall survival for patients who had undergone curative resection and those who had not were 7 mo (range: 6-16 mo) and 3 mo (range: 0.25-9 mo), respectively[10].\n\nGastric SCC is another rare disease accounting for 0.04% to 0.2% of all gastric carcinomas[3-5]. According to the Japanese classification, primary gastric SCC can be diagnosed if all tumor cells are identified as squamous cell and if there is evidence that carcinoma arises from gastric mucosa[13]. Although the pathogenesis of gastric SCC is yet to be elucidated, hypothesis includes squamous differentiation of existing adenocarcinoma, squamous metaplasia of gastric mucosa prior to malignant transformation, differentiation from multipotent stem cells, translocation of ectopic squamous cell in gastric mucosa, gastric vascular endothelial cell, and effect of viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and human papilloma virus. Similar to pancreatic SCC, there is no established standardized treatment. For cases with resectable gastric SCC, radical resection is recommended to improve survival[14]. However, it is usually impossible as most gastric SCCs are found at advanced stages. For metastatic gastric SCC, chemotherapy may be considered as a treatment option. Single or combination regimens of agents such as 5-fluorouracil, platinum, and taxane is usually used[15-17]. However, currently there is no established optimal regimen. Overall survival of metastatic gastric SCC has been reported to be 7 mo[16], which is shorter than that (12-16 mo) of gastric adenocarcinoma.\n\nThe patient had received curative resection for pancreatic SCC. Three years later, she was diagnosed with gastric SCC which had metastasized to the liver and the peritoneum. As direct invasion from pancreatic SCC to the stomach has been reported[18,19], it can be argued that the gastric SCC might be relapsed lesion of the previous pancreatic SCC. We think it is more reasonable to judge it as a metachronous case for the following reasons. First, given the aggressive nature of pancreatic SCC, median overall survival of patients with curative resection of pancreatic SCC is 7 mo (range: 6-16 mo), with 1 year survival rate of 4.8%[8]. However, our patient survived for 3 years after the diagnosis of PSCC. Second, according to gastroscopy findings, it is a single mucosal lesion in the stomach, not a direct invasion of other organs or multiple mucosal lesions. Third, stomach is an unusual site for metastasis. Primary origins of cancers associated with metastasis to the stomach are known to be lung, breast, esophagus, and melanoma.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor pancreatic SCC and gastric SCC, each of them is an extremely rare and aggressive tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of metachronous SCC on stomach occurring after the diagnosis of pancreatic SCC. Based on the rare incidence of this histologic subtype in the pancreas and the stomach, there is a need for ongoing research on their diagnosis and treatment options.\n\nInformed consent statement: We could not receive written informed consent for publication as the patient had already passed away.\n\nConflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\nCARE Checklist (2016) statement: The authors have read the CARE Checklist (2016), and the manuscript was prepared and revised according to the CARE Checklist (2016).\n\nManuscript source: Unsolicited manuscript\n\nPeer-review started: July 13, 2021\n\nFirst decision: August 19, 2021\n\nArticle in press: September 10, 2021\n\nSpecialty type: Gastroenterology and hepatology\n\nCountry/Territory of origin: South Korea\n\nPeer-review report\u2019s scientific quality classification\n\nGrade A (Excellent): A\n\nGrade B (Very good): B\n\nGrade C (Good): 0\n\nGrade D (Fair): 0\n\nGrade E (Poor): 0\n\nP-Reviewer: Li JL, Zhao J S-Editor: Yan JP L-Editor: A P-Editor: Xing YX",

The downside of using such molecules is the potential risk of developing immune-related adverse events. Factors that trigger these autoimmune side effects are yet to be elucidated. Although any organ can potentially be affected, kidney involvement is usually rare. In this case report, we describe the first known instance of a patient being treated with an inhibitor of programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1, a checkpoint inhibitor) who develops acute tubulointerstitial nephritis after contracting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nA 62-year-old patient, on immunotherapy treatment for stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma, presents to the emergency department with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. Severe acute kidney injury is discovered with electrolyte imbalances requiring urgent dialysis initiation. Further testing reveals that the patient has contracted the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nA kidney biopsy was performed and was compatible with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was treated with high dose corticosteroid therapy followed by progressive tapering.\nRapid and sustained normalization of kidney function was achieved after completion of the steroid course.\nWe hypothesize that the viral infection along with checkpoint inhibitor use has created a proinflammatory environment which led to a loss of self-tolerance to renal parenchyma. Viruses may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in this patient population than was previously thought.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nOver the last decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have created exciting new therapeutic options for cancer treatment.1 Unfortunately, stimulating the immune system to fight malignancy comes with the potential risk of developing various immune-related adverse events (irAE).2 One of the most frequently encountered irAE that pertains to the kidney is acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN). While the specific pathophysiology remains obscure, proposed mechanisms include auto-immune hypersensitivity reactions, ultimately leading to parenchymal inflammation with consequent decline in kidney function.3\n\nViruses are a known cause of ATIN as well as other autoimmune diseases. However, whether they are implicated in triggering irAE is still uncertain. A potential link has been recently discovered between Epstein-Barr virus and autoimmune encephalitis in a patient on immunotherapy.4 Here, we describe the first clear temporal association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the development of ATIN in the context of immunotherapy.\n\nA 62-year-old female, known for poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary origin with lymph node metastases and peritoneal carcinomatosis, had been undergoing investigational treatment with durvalumab (1500 mg monthly) since May of 2017. In September of 2019, she developed a generalized rash and was thoroughly investigated by dermatology. The final diagnosis retained was a lichen or bullous pemphigoid-like eruption which was ultimately attributed to the immunotherapy, possibly triggered by concomitant use of celecoxib. The patient has last used celecoxib in September of 2019 and has since not taken any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There was no kidney involvement or other systemic toxicity noted at that time. Durvalumab was temporarily discontinued and restarted in January of 2020 while the patient remained on prednisone 10 mg daily indefinitely.\n\nPresenting Concerns\n\nIn mid-May of 2020, 3 weeks following her last durvalumab infusion, the patient developed dry cough, dyspnea and fever. Approximately 10 days later, she presented to the emergency department (ER) with a deterioration of her symptoms and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction.\n\nClinical Findings\n\nThe patient weighed 68 kg with a body mass index of 24.4 kg/m2 on admission and had no significant weight fluctuations during her hospitalization. Initial investigations revealed severe rapidly progressive acute kidney injury with refractory hyperkalemia for which the patient required conventional intermittent hemodialysis within 24 hours after initial presentation. Urinary output was preserved with an average of 50 ml per hour over 24 hours calculated via catheter before start of first dialysis session. A single dose of furosemide 40 mg intravenous was given for hyperkalemia within the first hour. The patient had normal kidney function prior to admission with a baseline serum creatinine of 50 \u03bcmol/L, did not have a prior history of kidney disease and had not taken any medications known to potentially cause kidney injury including over-the-counter drugs and herbal medicine. Her home medications included acetaminophen, atorvastatin, prednisone, calcium, vitamin D, pregabalin, and levothyroxine. She was however treated in March of 2020 with cloxacillin 1g 3 times per day for 7 days total for an infectious lymphadenitis with excellent clinical response and with 2 normal documented serum creatinine values (50 \u03bcmol/L and 45 \u03bcmol/L) in the month following treatment. No new rash or arthritis was found on physical examination during her stay. Her blood pressure remained stable without any significant fluctuations, including during her dialysis sessions; we defined significant hypotension as blood pressure < 90 mmHg systolic and hypertension as > 180 mmHg systolic). While multiple bilateral ground-glass opacities were present on chest X-ray, she did not require supplementary oxygen. Absolute lymphocyte count fluctuated significantly during her hospitalization with a nadir of 0.52 x 109/L without eosinophilia. Urinalysis revealed leukocyturia (11-100 white blood cells per high power field [HPF]), microscopic hematuria (11-100 red blood cells per HPF) and significant proteinuria (protein/creatinine ratio: 0.441 g/mmol) but without other clinical features of a nephrotic syndrome. Eosinophiluria was not tested. There were no casts on microscopic urinalysis. C3 and C4 complement levels were normal. A low antinuclear antibody titer (1/160) was present, but anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane and anti-DNA were absent. C-reactive protein was elevated on admission (271.5 mg/L). A computed tomography of the kidneys was performed on the first day, showing no signs of hydronephrosis, hypertrophy or other abnormalities. A dedicated kidney ultrasound was not done.\n\nDiagnostic Focus and Assessment\n\nThe left kidney was biopsied on day 7 of admission and revealed a histological pattern compatible with severe ATIN (Figure 1). In-situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 did not show the presence of the virus within the tissue.\n\nFigure 1. (A) Renal histopathology revealing a severe diffuse neutrophil-rich tubulointerstitial inflammatory infiltrate on periodic acid-Schiff staining, and (B) Tubulitis is also present (*) with areas of focal necrosis (black arrow).\n\nNote. Within tubules, necrotic debris and inflammatory cells are noted without casts. Mild mesangial hypercellularity was also present within the glomeruli (not shown). Immunofluorescence did not reveal immunoglobulin or complement deposition within the glomeruli or tubulointerstitial compartment.\n\nTherapeutic Focus and Assessment\n\nOral prednisone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day was initiated on day 11 of hospitalization and rapidly tapered to 1 mg/kg/day on day 17 upon recovery of kidney function, permitting discontinuation of hemodialysis treatments (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Evolution of serum creatinine over time in relationship with clinical events.\n\nNote. Hemodialysis sessions are denoted by * N.B. there are no creatinine values available between her baseline value (<60 \u03bcmol/L) and the rise noted a few days before admission (131 \u03bcmol/L).\n\nFollow-Up and Outcomes\n\nThe patient returned to her baseline clinically and was discharged 17 days after admission. Follow-up assessment revealed rapid and sustained continuous improvement in kidney function.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis is the first report describing a temporal association between a viral respiratory infection, in this case SARS-CoV-2, and the development of severe ATIN in association with ICI use. Although the criteria required to demonstrate direct invasion of the virus remain uncertain,5-7 the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 within the kidney tissue by immunochemistry suggests that development of ATIN was not related to direct infection of kidney parenchyma by the virus. One possible hypothetical explanation is an immune regulation dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2 as described in other organs8 and amplified in the setting of anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) therapy.\n\nThe majority of ATIN induced by ICI are seen within the first year of treatment, typically within 6 to 12 weeks for anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) and within 3 to 12 months for anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1).9 In this case, ATIN occurred 3 years after starting immunotherapy, although treatment was temporarily interrupted for cutaneous toxicity. It is important to note, however, that drug-induced bullous pemphigoid has been associated with acute interstitial nephritis10 and may indicate increased individual susceptibility to autoimmune toxicities.\n\nAcute kidney injury is a frequent complication of COVID-19 and the spectrum of kidney disease associated is vast. There is, however, little literature currently available that describes acute interstitial nephritis in patients with COVID-19. One recent case that has been reported shows granulomatous acute interstitial nephritis in a patient with COVID-19 but with many other confounding factors such as use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid during development of the acute interstitial nephritis along with eosinophilia and maculopapular rash. In that patient, the response to corticosteroids was also noted to be rapid and efficacious.11 According to our clinical experience, interstitial nephritis caused by ICI toxicity respond very promptly to corticosteroid therapy. Although the median time to creatinine improvement was not described, the most comprehensive study on the phenomenon reports a complete recovery rate of 40%.12 In conclusion, we believe that a viral infection, in this case SARS-CoV-2 has acted as a trigger in the development of ATIN through an immunoregulatory disbalance in a susceptible individual despite systemic corticosteroid treatment. The use of cloxacillin in the past months might have also contributed to the disruption in immunomodulation and further increased the individual\u2019s susceptibility toward ATIN. The pro-inflammatory effect of a systemic viral infection may tip the delicate balance between self-tolerance and immunity in the setting of ICI therapy leading to cross-reactivity and subsequent ATIN. It has been shown that numerous autoimmune disorders can potentially be precipitated by the hyperinflammatory state caused by SARS-CoV-2.13 Furthermore, in organ transplantations, some viral infections may also lead to acute rejections. It is possible that there is some pathophysiologic overlap between these allograft dysfunctions and what we have observed,14,15 It is currently unclear if this represents a frequent mechanism leading to irAE in clinical practice but may warrant increased clinician surveillance of patients treated with ICIs in the setting of viral illnesses, especially relevant in today\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEthics Approval and Consent to Participate: This case report is waived from institutional review board approval.\n\nConsent for Publication: We obtained written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case report.\n\nAvailability of Data and Materials: Not applicable.\n\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nFunding: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: WBS is supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Qu\u00e9bec en Sant\u00e9.\n\nORCID iDs: Dimitry Buyansky https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4470-1522\n\nWilliam Beaubien-Souligny https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3030-8703",

Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) without an anticoagulant because of hemorrhagic status, showed the effectiveness for severe respiratory failure by DAH with AAV. A 44-year-old woman developed DAH with bowel bleeding following the onset of AAV, with positive anti-proteinase-3 (PR3) antibodies. Although ventilator management could not support her respiratory status, VV-ECMO was performed. The patient was given immunosuppressive therapy comprising a steroid pulse, plasma exchange, and cyclophosphamide. After about 10 days of VV-ECMO and immunosuppressive therapy, VV-ECMO was withdrawn, and on day 12, ventilator support was stopped. Although a thrombus developed within the inferior vena cava (IVC), which required IVC filtration, the patient was discharged on day 51. VV-ECMO support was effective for treating DAH in this patient with new-onset AAV, which takes some time to achieve remission with immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1 Introduction\n\nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a frequent complication of interstitial lung disease (ILD). It has been reported that 46%\u201371% of patients are positive for anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies and 0\u201329% are positive for anti-proteinase-3 (PR3) antibodies. Besides AAV sometimes develop diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) as a complication [1]. In recent years, the 5-year survival rate of AAV has increased from 12% to 70%, but AAV as a complication of ILD is a risk factor for poor outcomes [2]. DAH occurs in 8%\u201336% of patients with AAV, and 57% of patients are positive for PR3 antibodies [3]. Moreover, 56% of patients with DAH and AAV require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for the treatment of respiratory failure using invasive or noninvasive ventilators [4]. Here, we report a patient with DAH complicated with AAV who was positive for PR3 antibodies. The patient developed severe respiratory failure and was unable to tolerate conventional ventilator support. Anticoagulant-free venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was necessary to maintain her respiratory function.\n\n2 Case presentation\n\nA 44-year-old woman with hemoptysis, hematuria, and epistaxis, and positive for PR3 antibodies, was scheduled to be hospitalized for renal and nasal biopsies. However, because the patient's respiratory status worsened, tracheal intubation with ventilator support was necessary. Although two days of steroid pulse therapy (1 g/day methylprednisolone) was started, her respiratory status did not improve within 2 days, and the patient required ventilator support with nearly 100% oxygen. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the ICU at our hospital with a suspected diagnosis of new-onset DAH with AAV (Fig. 1). On admission to the ICU, her oxygen partial pressure was 67.8\u00a0mmHg and her carbon dioxide partial pressure was 46.3\u00a0mmHg while on 100% oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure. Laboratory tests revealed the following: PR3 antibody titer, 28.2 IU/mL; white blood cell count, 16,100/\u03bcL; hemoglobin, 6.1 g/dL; platelet count, 187,000/\u03bcL; albumin, 2.1 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 23.7 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.44 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 34 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 19 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 779 U/L; total bilirubin, 1.1 mg/dL; creatinine phosphokinase, 657 U/L; C-reactive protein, 9.67 mg/dL; prothrombin time, 70.5%; activated partial thromboplastin time, 23.6 s; as well as hematuria and proteinuria.Fig. 1 Imaging findings upon admission to our intensive care unit. (a) Computed tomography revealed diffuse consolidation and atelectasis due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage affecting both lungs. (b) Bronchoscopy of the carina showing diffuse hemoptysis. (c) Bronchoscopy of the right upper bronchus showing an ulcer and hemoptysis.\n\nFig. 1\n\nAnticoagulant-free VV-ECMO was initially started using a heparin-coated circuit and it was planned to introduce anticoagulant gradually. However, bowel bleeding occurred on day 2 of admission. Because a colonoscopy showed multiple ulcers, an anticoagulant was not used for almost the entire duration of VV-ECMO. An anticoagulant (nafamostat) was trialed on day 9, but it needed to be stopped due to recurrent bowel bleeding.\n\nTo treat AAV, the patient was given a steroid pulse for 1 day followed by 1.0 mg/kg/day of prednisolone, and daily plasma exchange (7 times in 8 days). Additionally, 500 mg of cyclophosphamide was infused on day 6 (Fig. 2). After starting VV-ECMO support, oxygen partial pressure was maintained more than 150\u00a0mmHg by VV-ECMO with 100% oxygen gas and 3.5\u20134.0 L/min flow. On day 11, bilateral diffuse infiltration shadow by DAH was decreased on chest X-ray, after checking more than 250\u00a0mmHg of P/F ratio with clamping ECMO oxygen gas (no oxygen), VV-ECMO was withdrawn. On day 12, P/F ratio showed more than 400\u00a0mmHg, therefore, ventilator support was stopped and the patient was extubated. Only one VV-ECMO circuit could be completed without anticoagulant within a 10-day course without circuit exchange. However, deep vein thrombosis in the inferior vena cava (IVC) was diagnosed by computed tomography on day 12, which required IVC filtration management for 17 days, afterwards there was no recurrence of thrombus.Fig. 2 Clinical course. CRP = C-reactive protein; mPSL\u00a0=\u00a0methylprednisolone; PSL\u00a0=\u00a0prednisolone; PR3\u00a0=\u00a0anti-proteinase-3; VV-ECMO\u00a0=\u00a0venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n\nFig. 2\n\nThe patient was transferred from the ICU to a general ward on day 13, and discharged from hospital on day 51, after four infusions of cyclophosphamide (500 mg) by every two weeks. After a total of six infusions of cyclophosphamide, AAV was relapsed and the patient was prescribed rituximab (500 mg) by every two weeks, started 71st day from discharge, combined with 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisolone.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nIn the present case, although steroid pulse therapy was started after the diagnosis of DAH with AAV, the patient's respiratory failure could not be managed with conventional ventilator support at a previous hospital. After being transferred to our hospital, plasma exchange, steroid pulse, and cyclophosphamide were started, and we also decided to use VV-ECMO support. It took about 10 days to treat her DAH and suppress hemorrhage, after which VV-ECMO support was successfully withdrawn.\n\nSome papers have reported the use of VV-ECMO support for managing respiratory failure caused by DAH with AAV [5,6]. These papers showed that VV-ECMO could support the respiratory function until the initial immunosuppressive therapies had elicited a sufficient effect, especially in new-onset AAV cases. Prior cases were 13\u201365 years old, included males and females, and VV-ECMO support lasted 5\u201321 days. Our case required VV-ECMO support for 10 days, which is within the expected range for the immunosuppressive therapy to elicit clinical effects in new-onset AAV.\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 7% of cases of AAV [7]. Our case experienced bowel bleeding and colonoscopy revealed multiple ulcers in her colon. This symptom is likely to be related to AAV and improved following immunosuppressive therapy. However, bowel bleeding and DAH precluded the use of an anticoagulant. Therefore, VV-ECMO was managed using a heparin-coated circuit, without an anticoagulant. A previous report described the use of VV-ECMO without or with a low dose of heparin for cases with a high risk of bleeding. The frequencies of thrombotic and bleeding complications did not differ from those of full-dose heparin [8]. In our case, to maintain the lifetime of anticoagulant-free VV-ECMO, we tried to maintain the pump flow above 4 L/min. Consequently, VV-ECMO could be continued for 10 days, but an IVC thrombus developed that required treatment.\n\nIn a single-center historical cohort, Cartin-Ceba et al. reported that DAH occurred in 8.3% of patients with AAV, who were then treated with plasma exchange, corticosteroid, rituximab, and/or cyclophosphamide. VV-ECMO support was not performed. The length of ICU stay was 6.1 days and 11% of patients died [4]. Because our patient received VV-ECMO support, her ICU stay was longer, at 13 days.\n\nReddy et al. reported the review article about ECMO support for DAH and diffuse alveolar damage. The review contained 38 cases with 84.2% of DAH, VV-ECMO for 73.7% and venoarterial-ECMO for 13.2%, median duration of ECMO support was 9.5 days, hospital mortality was 10.5% (VV-ECMO was 7.1%), ECMO circuit thrombus was occurred in 10.5% (rate of using anticoagulant was unknown) [9].\n\nVV-ECMO support for DAH with AAV was successfully performed without an anticoagulant owing to the patient's risk of bleeding, although an IVC thrombus occurred. Although the length of ICU stay is expected to be longer, VV-ECMO support can be a useful strategy for severe DAH with AAV, especially for new-onset cases that require longer immunosuppressive therapy to achieve remission.\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nThis case of DAH with AAV was treated with conventional immunosuppressive therapies combined with anticoagulant-free VV-ECMO support. This strategy could be useful for managing patients with severe respiratory failure, especially those with new-onset DAH with AAV, who have not received any specific therapies.\n\nAuthor Declaration of No Conflict of Interest.\n\nAuthors have no financial or non-financial interest.\n\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\n\nBoth RE and TK have authorship contribution and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nHypogammaglobulinemia and Infections in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Rituximab.\n\nABSTRACT:\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine the frequency of hypogammaglobulinemia and infections in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) receiving rituximab (RTX).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis prospective observational study included all consecutive PwMS receiving RTX at the university hospital of Marseille, France, between 2015 and 2020. Patient visits occurred at least every 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 188 patients (151 with relapsing-remitting MS; the mean age was 43.4 years [SD 12.9], median disease duration 10 years [range 0-36], median Expanded Disability Status Scale 5 [range 0-8], median follow-up 3.5 years [range 1-5.8], and median number of RTX infusions 5 [range 1-9]). Overall, 317 symptomatic infections and 13 severe infections occurred in 133 of 188 (70.7%) and 11 of 188 (5.9%) patients, respectively. After 4 years, 24.4% of patients (95% CI 18.0-33.1) were free of any infection and 92.0% (95% CI 87.1-97.1) had not experienced a severe infection. At RTX onset, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was abnormal in 32 of 188 (17%) patients. After RTX, IgG level was <7, <6, <4 and <2 g/L for 83 (44%), 44 (23.4%), 8 (4.2%) and 1 (0.53%) patients, respectively. The risk of infection was associated with reduced IgG levels (multivariate Cox proportional hazards hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98, p = 0.03). The risk of reduced IgG level <6 g/L increased with age (HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.05-1.75, p = 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn PwMS receiving RTX, reduced IgG level was frequent and interacted with the risk of infection.\n\nTEXT:\npmcB-cell depleting therapy is highly effective against relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).1,2 Nonetheless, among disease-modifying therapies for MS, B-cell depleting therapy is associated with the highest risk of infection.3 Treatment-induced hypogammaglobulinemia contributes to infections in patients with rheumatologic and hematologic diseases and neuromyelitis optica disorders treated with B-cell depleting therapy.4-6 We do not know whether treatment-induced hypogammaglobulinemia could also be involved and be harmful in patients with MS (PwMS), who are generally younger and with fewer comorbidities than those with other diseases. Pivotal studies1,7 have demonstrated that hypogammaglobulinemia is infrequent in PwMS during the first years of treatment, but little is known about its potential medium-term incidence in nonselected patients nor about its interaction with the risk of infection.\n\nWe report the incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia and infections in PwMS receiving rituximab (RTX) in the MS center of Marseille, France, and followed since their first infusion.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Population\n\nWe started to use RTX off-label for PwMS in the MS center of Marseille in 2015. All consecutive patients were prospectively included in an observational study. The induction treatment consisted of 1,000 mg infused twice at 2-week intervals. The maintenance regimen consisted of a single infusion of 1,000 mg administered every 6 months until 2018. After 2018, our department changed the clinical practice concerning the dosing interval used for off-label RTX in relapsing-remitting MS (see reference 8 for more details). We extended the interval between 2 infusions beyond 6 months and up to 24 months, maintaining clinical visits every 6 months and MRI monitoring at least annually.\n\nMedical Visits\n\nPatients visited the center for each RTX infusion, in case of relapse or adverse events, and at least every 6 months. In case of fever, patients had to inform our department at any time. All examinations were performed by the same neurologist of our department (A.R., C.B., A.M., J.P., or B.A.) and included a standardized screening for infection, the most frequent potential adverse event associated with RTX. All infections were graded by using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0: grade 1, asymptomatic; grade 2, localized or noninvasive intervention indicated; grade 3, intravenous antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral drugs indicated, interventional radiology or surgical intervention indicated; grade 4, life-threatening events; and grade 5, death. To be retained as a symptomatic infection (grade \u2265 2), a clinical event must be characterized by physical signs suggestive of infection and fever or positive radiographic or positive laboratory findings.\n\nSerum Levels of Immunoglobulins\n\nImmunoglobulin (Ig) levels were measured before RTX onset and at least every 6 months. Four categories of IgG levels were defined: normal level, \u22657 g/L; reduced IgG level 1, 6\u20137 g/L; reduced IgG level 2, 4\u20136 g/L; reduced IgG level 3, 2\u20134 g/L; and reduced IgG level 4, \u22642 g/L. Corresponding levels for IgM were <0.4 g/L and for IgA <0.7 g/L.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nMultivariate Cox proportional hazard models for recurrent events were used to assess the risk of symptomatic infection. Variables tested were age, disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, sex, and levels of Igs. To account for intraindividual correlation of observations, we included patient ID as a cluster variable. We investigated the occurrence of reduced Ig levels during RTX treatment with similar multivariate models. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were computed for the following variables: age, sex, and disease-modifying therapy with an immunosuppressive action before RTX. We used the Schoenfeld test to check for possible violations of the proportional hazard model. R v4.0.2, including the survival package, was used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nStandard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents\n\nThe authors obtained ethical approval of the institutional review board of the university hospital of Marseille, France (approval no.: RGPD/Ap-Hm 2021-19), to conduct this study.\n\nData Availability\n\nAll data analyzed during this study will be shared anonymized by reasonable request of a qualified investigator to the corresponding author.\n\nResults\n\nStudy Population\n\nIn total, 188 patients received RTX and were followed in our department since 2015; 151 (80.5%) had relapsing-remitting MS, 20 (10.5%) secondary progressive MS, and 17 (9%) primary progressive MS. RTX was used as first-line therapy in 18 patients; 159 (84.6%) patients received at least 1 disease-modifying therapy with an immunosuppressive action before RTX. At RTX onset, the mean age of patients was 43.4 years (SD 12.9), sex ratio 1.7 (F/M; 118/70), median disease duration 10 years (range 0\u201336), and median EDSS score 5 (range 0\u20138). The median follow-up after the first RTX infusion was 3.5 years (range 1\u20135.8), and the median number of RTX infusions 5 (range 1\u20139).\n\nEleven patients stopped RTX during the follow-up because of severe infection (n = 5), hypogammaglobulinemia (n = 1), psoriasis (n = 1), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 1), stroke (n = 1), myocardial infarction (n = 1), and toxidermia (n = 1). Eight patients were lost to follow-up.\n\nFrequency of Reduced Levels of Igs\n\nBefore and after RTX onset, 32 (17%) and 83 (44%) of the 188 patients showed reduced IgG level <7 g/L, 14 (7.4%) and 44 (23.4%) reduced IgG level <6 g/L, 1 (0.53%) and 8 (4.2%) reduced IgG level <4 g/L, and none and 1 (0.53%) reduced IgG level <2 g/L (Figure). At baseline, 26 (14.1%) patients had an IgM level <0.4 g/L, but no patient had a level <0.2 g/L. During the follow-up, 16 (8.6%) patients had an IgM <0.2 g/L and 67 (35.8%) from 0.2 to 0.4 g/L. Reduced IgA level <0.7 g/L was uncommon at baseline (n = 10, 5.4%) and during the follow-up (n = 23, 12.3%).\n\nFigure Time in Years to First Infection or Hypogammaglobulinemia and Predictors\n\nTime in years to first symptomatic infection (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0, grade \u22652) (A) first severe infection (grade \u22653), (C) first reduced serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) level <6 g/L, (D) and first reduced serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) level <0.4 g/L in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with rituximab (RTX) (G). Predictors of symptomatic infections, (B) severe infections, (D) hypogammaglobulinemia of IgG and IgM after RTX onset, (F) and (H) respectively. Reduced IgA level <0.7 g/L was uncommon at baseline and during the follow-up (figure not reported). A similar model for IgM did not detect any association between the serum level and infections (figure not reported). Data in B, D, F and H are hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs). AgeDec = age per decade; EDSS = Expanded Disability Status Scale score; SEXM = sex male; TRT_IS_preO = treatment with an immunosuppressive action before RTX onset.\n\nFrequency of Infections After RTX Onset\n\nAfter RTX onset, 133 of 188 (70.7%) and 11 of 188 (5.9%) patients had 317 symptomatic infections (grade \u22652) and 13 severe infections (grade \u22653), respectively, with a median number of symptomatic infections per patient of 1 (range 0\u201316) (Table). Half of the patients had at least one infection after 1.5 years. After 4 years, 24.4% of patients (95% CI 18.0\u201333.1) were free of any infection and 92.0% (95% CI 87.1\u201397.1) had not experienced a severe infection.\n\nTable Symptomatic Infections (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 grade \u2265 2), Including 13 Severe Infections (grade \u22653), After Rituximab (RTX) Treatment\n\nPredictors of Symptomatic Infection and Hypogammaglobulinemia After RTX\n\nHigh IgG level was associated with the reduced risk of infection (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.75\u20130.98, p = 0.029), with no predictive value of age (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.75\u20131.05, p = 0.162), EDSS score (HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.64\u20131.07, p = 0.143), male sex (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.60\u20131.24, p = 0.415), or interaction between IgG level and EDSS score (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.99\u20131.05, p = 0.122). Similar models for IgM did not detect any association between serum levels and infections. The risk of reduced IgG level <6 g/L increased with age (HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.06\u20131.75, p = 0.016) but was not associated with sex (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.52\u20132.11, p = 0.902) or history of immunosuppressive treatment (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.46\u20133.02, p = 0.742). IgM level <0.4 g/L was more common in men vs women (HR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.28\u20133.04, p = 0.002) but was not associated with age (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.90\u20131.28, p = 0.421) or history of immunosuppressive treatment (HR = 1.33, 95% CI 0.69\u20132.56, p = 0.392). All patients with IgA level <0.7 g/L had a history of immunosuppression, but sex and age were not associated. All HRs were stable over time.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn our study, 23.4% and 4.2% of PwMS, who received a median number of 5 RTX cycles (range 1\u20139), showed reduced IgG level <6 and <4 g/L. During this period, 70.7% of patients experienced at least 1 symptomatic infection and 5.9% at least 1 severe infection. Importantly, we demonstrate that IgG level interacted with the risk of infection.\n\nRecently, data were published from the open-label extension of the phase 3 study testing ocrelizumab in relapsing-remitting MS.9 The study revealed that at 5 years, 5.4% of the patients who completed the study had an IgG level <5.68 g/L. However, the authors did not compare the incidence of reduced IgG level between patients who received ocrelizumab from the study onset (5 years) or after 3 years. Moreover, the frequency of hypogammaglobulinemia reported at 5 years may be underestimated owing to a potential high incidence of reduced IgG level in patients who did not complete the study. In a recent retrospective study of a large sample of PwMS receiving RTX or ocrelizumab, 3.7% showed a reduced IgG value < 5 g/L after a mean exposure of 29.7 months (SD 21).10 As we demonstrated, this study found that IgG level interacted with the risk of infection.\n\nThe observational design of this study and the absence of a control group prevent firm conclusions about the incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia and infections directly related to treatment. Moreover, the rather short observation time might have restricted the ability to detect an increase in risk of hypogammaglobulinemia with longer treatment duration. However, the present findings highlight the need to regularly monitor Ig levels in PwMS receiving B-cell depleting therapy to potentially reduce the risk of infection.\n\nStudy Funding\n\nThe authors report no targeted funding.\n\nDisclosure\n\nAll authors report no disclosures relevant to the manuscript.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nPsoriasis, Vitiligo, and Biologic Therapy: Case Report and Narrative Review.\n\nABSTRACT:\nPsoriasis and vitiligo are 2 multifactorial immune-mediated diseases, partially sharing pathogenetic underpinnings. Their coexistence in the same patient, although uncommon, is documented in the literature. Further, several cases of vitiligo induced by biological drugs in psoriatic patients are reported. However, improvements in psoriasis and pre-existing vitiligo after the introduction of biological therapy are also described. To date, anti-TNF-alpha is the most cited group of biological drugs that induce new-onset vitiligo or progression of pre-existence vitiligo in psoriatic patients. Even anti-IL-12/23 class would seem to induce vitiligo (as in our case) or even worse it. Anti-IL-17 drugs induce a progression of pre-existing vitiligo while, to date, no cases are reported in literature considering anti-IL-23 class.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nSeveral cases of vitiligo induced by biological drugs in psoriatic patients are reported in the literature. However, improvements of pre-existing vitiligo after the introduction of biological therapy are also described. This relationship is not still clear. Based on the case of a young Italian male suffering from psoriasis, who developed a progression of a pre-existence vitiligo after treatment with ustekinumab, we explore the association between psoriasis, vitiligo, and biological therapy. We evaluated all the cases and studies reported in the literature, elaborating a narrative review to define, to date, which biological drugs are more involved in the progression/onset of vitiligo in the psoriatic patient.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 32-year-old male outpatient came for a visit in April 2008 in our Dermatology department for the worsening of his psoriasis. He has suffered from plaque psoriasis, localized at the genitalia, elbows, and scalp, since the age of 11. The patient was treated with various topical therapies without success and followed up regularly. In November 2012, vitiligo patches appeared in the subaxillary area and subsequently on the perioral area (shown in Fig. 1). The thyroid function was investigated and was normal; furthermore, celiac disease was excluded. Therapy with methotrexate (10 mg/week IM) followed by folic acid 24 h later was started in February 2016. After 24 months, it was suspended for intolerance and inefficacy. In April 2018, his clinical state worsened. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was 15, while the hypopigmented patches were stable. Having appropriate screening exams, he started biologic therapy with ustekinumab (Stelara\u00ae) 90 mg SC (followed by injection after 4 weeks and every 12 weeks for maintenance). His psoriasis improved after 8 weeks (from PASI 15 to PASI 5) but a vitiligo patch appeared on the penis shaft (shown in Fig. 2a, b), close to the resolved psoriasis patches. After 6 months, the penis vitiligo patch increased (shown in Fig. 3) in size while the subaxillary patches remained unchanged. At the last control, performed 12 months later the hypopigmented lesions had stabilized.\n\nMethodology of the Literature Search\n\nLiterature searches in the PubMed database were conducted using the following search terms: \u201cpsoriasis\u201d and \u201cvitiligo\u201d and \u2018biologic therapy or \u201canti TNF-Alpha\u201d or \u201canti IL-12/23\u201d or \u201canti IL-17\u201d or \u201canti IL-23\u201d or \u201cinfliximab\u201d or \u201cadalimumab\u201d or \u201cetanercept\u201d or \u201ccertolizumab pegol\u201d or \u201custekinumab\u201d or \u201csecukinumab,\u201d or \u201cixekizumab\u201d or \u201cbrodalumab\u201d or \u201cguselkumab.\u201d The inclusion criterion was the English language. Articles not focused on psoriasis (i.e., biologic treatment not used to treat specifically psoriasis) were excluded.\n\nResults\n\nThe search yielded 10 publications, described as follows, and summarized in Table 1.\n\nVitiligo and Anti-TNF-Alpha Class\n\nSix articles reported vitiligo associated with TNF-alpha inhibitors in psoriatic patients. Adalimumab is the most represented drug and reported in 4 articles. Except for one paper by Campanati et al. [2] wherein vitiligo and psoriasis improved after 24 months of treatment with etanercept, all publications described new-onset vitiligo or a progression of a pre-existence vitiligo. Lu et al. [1] described a case of nonsegmental vitiligo that appeared following infliximab infusion. The disease has been regressing for 1 year after drug interruption. Palazzo [3] described the case of a patient who suffered from vitiligo in correspondence of the psoriatic lesions after the treatment with adalimumab which resolved in 1 year switching to secukinumab. Tirado-S\u00e1nchez and Bonifaz [4] reported a case of new-onset vitiligo and bullous pemphigoid disease associated with adalimumab treatment for psoriasis. Smith and Heffernan [5] reported a case of new-onset vitiligo (nonsegmental type) that appeared in correspondence of resolute psoriatic plaques after adalimumab therapy. The lesions remained stable during biological therapy.\n\nFor certolizumab pegol, 2 cases of de novo vitiligo are reported. The disease for which the patient used the drug is not indicated [8]. According to a cohort study [10], adalimumab and infliximab seem to be the anti-TNF-alpha inhibitors with the highest risk to develop vitiligo. Overall, in the literature, the use of anti TNF-alpha drugs in repigmentation is considered ineffective [11]. Until now, no case of golimumab-induced vitiligo has been reported.\n\nVitiligo and Anti-IL-12/23 Class\n\nData from the literature are limited and reported in only 3 papers. In fact, a case of vitiligo improvement was reported in a psoriatic patient treated with ustekinumab [7]. Instead, Mery-Bossard et al. [6] and Anthony et al. [8] reported, respectively, in 2 different studies, 18 total cases of ustekinumab-induced vitiligo and one case of drug-induced worsening vitiligo. In both papers, the patient's disease is not specified.\n\nVitiligo and Anti-IL-17 Class\n\nSpeeckaert et al. [9] reported a study on 8 patients in which secukinumab were used to treat a nonsegmental form of vitiligo. A progression of the disease was observed in 7 patients, without any sign of repigmentation. Furthermore, the authors concluded that the use of anti-IL-17 was not likely to affect the pathogenetic mechanism of vitiligo, considering that IL-17 and Th17 lymphocytes do not participate in the cytotoxic destruction of melanocytes. Instead, the authors suggested that drugs acting on the differentiation imbalance of Th17 to Th17.1/Th1 lymphocytes would be more promising. No cases are reported for brodalumab and ixekizumab.\n\nVitiligo and Anti-IL-23 Class\n\nSo far, there are no published reports of vitiligo induced/worse by the anti-IL-23 class.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPsoriasis is an immune-mediated and multifactorial chronic inflammatory skin disease, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 0.51 to 11.43% in adults [12]. Data about the prevalence of vitiligo vary from 0.06 to 2.28% in the general population [12]. The prevalence of the association between these 2 diseases is not clear: it is considered a rare event, but probably, it is underestimated [12]. In fact, observational studies are very scarce, and data are inconsistent. In clinical practice, 2 conditions usually show this association: first, psoriasis and vitiligo are present at the same time in the same patient (the so-called immune patient); second, the appearance of vitiligo is the side effect of the drugs used to treat psoriasis. In the first case, psoriasis has a strong tendency to associate with other autoimmune/immune-mediated diseases. Data suggest that a patient during the lifetime has a 25% chance of developing vitiligo [13]. Similarly, psoriasis was found to be the second most associated comorbidity in patients with vitiligo [14]. These 2 disorders present a similar pathogenetic background: psoriasis and vitiligo are cell-mediated Th-1 diseases with increased TNF-alpha and interferon \u03b3 levels [15]. Also, both share the activation of the Th17 pathway [12]. So far, it is unknown which of the 2 concurrent pathologies appears first. They can appear in the same areas or can be localized in different sites. As reported in the study [14], in almost 47% of patients with both diseases the lesions were separated, as in our case, while 34% of patient's psoriasis plaques covered the vitiligo patches [15].\n\nRegarding vitiligo as a side effect, the literature is focused on the biological therapies and few cases are reported. Two scenarios are described: (1) vitiligo appears for the first time as a consequence of the onset of biological therapy (i.e., new-onset vitiligo) or (2) there is a pre-existence vitiligo that improves or worsens as a consequence of the biological treatment. This difference has an important prognostic value: in fact, the new-onset vitiligo shows a better outcome when the biological therapy is maintained [6]. Instead, regarding a pre-existence vitiligo, the use of some biological drugs can aggravate it, inducing a progression [6], as happened to our patient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe relationship among psoriasis, vitiligo, and biological drugs is still unclear. Although data are limited, this narrative review of the literature seems to show the detrimental impact of anti-TNF-alpha treatment on vitiligo. The pathogenetic mechanisms by which this class can induce or improve vitiligo are unknown. It is difficult to understand how a molecule that blocks high levels of TNF-alpha can trigger the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. It has been proposed that the long-term use of anti TNF-alpha could create a cytokines-imbalance favoring a certain type of cytokines background that would provoke vitiligo [10].\n\nHowever, it should be considered that this class of drug has been on market for the longest than other classes of biologics, and this could also explain these results. Anti-IL-12/23 drugs could be considered a trigger of vitiligo too. Except for one case reported [7], ustekinumab seems to induce vitiligo (as well as in our case) or even to worse it when it is pre-existing.\n\nThe use of anti-IL-17 seems to produce bad outcomes in pre-existing vitiligo. Conversely, the data about anti-IL-23 are scarce, possibly because this drug has been marketed only recently.\n\nThus, this review highlights the paucity of data on the link between psoriasis and vitiligo underlining the gaps of knowledge on this topic. Further studies aimed at highlighting the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the 2 diseases are strongly needed.\n\nStatement of Ethics\n\nAll the procedures adopted in the present study were in respect to the ethical standards in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.

In the relapse group, overall survival (OS) was 38% (30-46%) at 2 years and 25% (17-32%) at 5 years. Patients who had a HLA-identical sibling (HLAid-Sib) donor for their first and second transplants had superior OS (5 year OS: HLAid-Sib/HLAid-Sib: 35% (24-46%); Others 9% (0-17%), p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was a significantly higher incidence of acute grade II-IV GvHD in those patients who had also developed GvHD following their initial HLA-identical sibling allo-HCT (HLAid-Sib/HLAid-Sib: 50% (33-67%); Other 22% (8-36%), p\u2009=\u20090.03). More as opposed to fewer than 2 years between transplants was associated with superior 5-yr OS (31% (21-40%) vs. 10% (1-20%), P\u2009=\u20090.005). On multivariate analysis, consecutive HLA-identical sibling donor transplants conferred a significant OS advantage (0.4 (0.24-0.67), p\u2009<\u20090.001). In the graft failure group, OS was 41% at 2 years. In summary, a second allo-HCT using a HLA-identical sibling donor, if available, provides the best transplant outcomes for relapsed myeloma in this setting.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nAlthough allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is not routinely performed in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), this approach is still offered to patients with high-risk disease. According to the EBMT database, there were 2684 MM patients transplanted in EBMT centres between 2013 and 2018. Post-transplant relapse remains the main cause of treatment failure. Options for the treatment of disease relapse following allo-HCT include salvage chemotherapy, novel targeted agents, and, increasingly, immunotherapies [1\u20134]. In selected patients who achieve clinical remission, there may be a role for a second allo-HCT [5\u201310].\n\nThe first reports of outcomes following second allogeneic transplants to treat disease relapse were characterised by prohibitively high rates of non-relapse mortality (NRM) of up to 45% [11, 12]. Less toxicity was seen with the use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens. Shaw and colleagues performed a retrospective U.K. multi-centre analysis of 71 patients receiving a second allogeneic transplant using RIC after disease relapse following an initial myeloablative allo-HCT [5]. The predicted overall survival (OS) and NRM at 2 years were 28% and 27%, respectively. In a subsequent EBMT registry study of 234 adult patients with acute leukaemia who received a second RIC transplant between 2000 and 2012 as salvage treatment for relapse following an initial RIC allo-HCT, the cumulative NRM and OS rates at 2 years were 22.4%, and 20.5%, respectively [6].\n\nIn a 2015 retrospective EBMT study of 2632\u2009second allogeneic transplants performed to treat disease relapse following a first transplant, the factors associated with better survival included the use of a HLA-identical sibling donor for the second transplant, low disease burden, longer remission duration after the first transplant, a longer interval between the transplants, younger age, the absence of grade II\u2013IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or chronic GvHD after the first transplant, and later year of transplant [13]. There was no difference in overall survival (OS) between those transplanted using their original donors when compared to those who were transplanted using new donors.\n\nSecond allogeneic transplants have also been performed to treat graft failure. Ferra and colleagues reported a 5 year OS of 31% in eighty patients who underwent a second transplant for graft failure [14]. Neutropenic patients and those transplanted using a second unrelated donor fared less well [15, 16].\n\nThere has, to date, only been one small report specifically relating to second allogeneic transplants in patients with myeloma following either disease relapse or graft failure [17]. We, therefore, performed a retrospective analysis of 215 patients with myeloma who underwent second allogeneic transplants between 1994 and 2017.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design\n\nThis study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the EBMT, a nonprofit, scientific society representing more than 600 transplant centres, mainly in Europe. All data is stored in a central database. Patients\u2019 informed consent was obtained locally according to regulations. The study cohort consisted of 215 patients with myeloma who were reported to the EBMT registry as having undergone a second allo-HCT either for relapsed myeloma or for graft failure. Second transplants performed for donor-derived haematological malignancies were excluded. The data were obtained from the EBMT data registry.\n\nAvailable donor information is categorized as either HLA-identical sibling (HLAid-Sib) or other, the latter group being composed of matched related and unrelated and mismatched related and unrelated donors.\n\nDisease stage was classified using the EBMT registry nomenclature regarding remission status at HSCT. Patients were classified as having either Low (PR or better) or Advanced (SD, MR, relapse, progression, primary refractory/no CR) stage disease, in this case, myeloma. In other words, patients with myeloma in less than a partial remission pre-transplant were considered to have advanced stage disease.\n\nThe primary outcomes of interest were OS, non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression, relapse/progression-free survival (PFS), and causes of death. Outcomes are provided at 2 or 5 years after the second HCT, depending on the availability of a sufficient number of patients in each of the subgroups of interest. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier product limit estimation method, and differences in subgroups were assessed by the Log-Rank test. Median follow-up was determined using the reverse Kaplan\u2013Meier method.\n\nThe cumulative incidence of relapse and NRM were analysed together in a competing risks framework. Neutrophil engraftment was defined as an absolute neutrophil count \u22650.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L for three consecutive days. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment is provided at day 28 after the second transplant, with the competing event being death without neutrophil engraftment. Competing risks analyses were also applied to estimate the incidences of acute grade II-IV GvHD and limited and extensive chronic GvHD (cGvHD), by day 100 and 2 and 5 years, respectively. Subgroup differences in cumulative incidences were assessed using Gray\u2019s test.\n\nMultivariable Cox regression was applied to investigate the simultaneous impact of multiple covariates on outcomes, when a sufficient number of patients and subsequent events were available. For OS and PFS, hazard ratios are provided, whereas for the competing risks outcome relapse, cause-specific hazard ratios are provided for the events of interest, both denoted as HR. Included covariates were used in all outcomes: Patient age at second transplant (in decades), patient sex, donor type (HLA identical sibling at both first and second transplant versus other), interval between first and second transplant (years), disease risk (low versus advanced), conditioning intensity (reduced versus myeloablative) and any previous GvHD (no versus yes). All models are stratified by categorized year of second transplant (\u22642008, >2008).\n\nContinuous variables are presented in text as median (range) and categorical variables as percentages within the group of patients with available data. All estimates are reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals in parentheses. All p values were two-sided and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.0 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria), using packages \u2018survival\u2019, \u2018prodlim\u2019 and \u2018cmprsk\u2019.\n\nResults\n\nPatient characteristics in the relapse (n\u2009=\u2009159) and graft failure (n\u2009=\u200956) cohorts are shown in Table\u00a01A.Table 1 (A) Patient characteristics at first and second transplants.

Data was not available for three patients. Of the 86 classified as having had \u2018two HLA-identical sibling donor\u2019 transplants, information on whether they were transplanted using the same or a different donor was available in 42 of the 86 cases; a total of 35 (83%) had two consecutive transplants from the same HLA-identical sibling donor and seven (17%) has two different HLA-identical sibling donors. Of the 70 patients who had other donor types, information on whether they were transplanted using the same or a different donor was available in 59 of the 70 cases. A total of 51 (86%) had different donors for the two transplants. There were eight patients (14%) who were transplanted from the same donor of \u2018other donor type\u2019.\n\nConditioning and GVHD prophylaxis\n\nConditioning regimens used in patients with relapsed disease were mostly fludarabine-based, included Fludarabine and Busulphan \u00b1ATG (27%), Fludarabine and Melphalan \u00b1ATG (22%), and Fludarabine and Treosulphan \u00b1ATG (9%). Other regimens included Bulsulphan and Cyclophosphamide \u00b1ATG (14%) and Busulphan and Melphalan \u00b1ATG (8%).\n\nGVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin-based approaches in 83% of patients in whom data was available, including cyclosporin and methotrexate (MTX) (42%) and cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (35%).\n\nGvHD\n\nThe rates of acute and chronic GVHD following the second transplant are shown in Table\u00a01C.\n\nWhen those patients with relapsed myeloma who had two consecutive HLA-identical sibling donor transplants (n\u2009=\u200986) were compared to all other donor combinations (n\u2009=\u200970), there was no difference in the rates of acute grade II-IV GvHD (HLAid-Sib/HLAid-Sib 34% (23\u201345%) versus other 25% (14\u201336%) (P\u2009=\u20090.2)).\n\nWhen outcomes were then stratified based, firstly, on the presence or absence of GVHD following the first transplant and, secondly, on whether patients had had two HLA-identical sibling donor transplants as opposed to other donor combinations, there was a significantly higher incidence of acute grade II\u2013IV GvHD in patients with prior GvHD who proceeded to a second HLA-identical sibling donor transplant (HLA-HLA: 50% (33\u201367%) vs. Other 22% (14\u201336%), p\u2009=\u20090.03).\n\nOverall survival\n\nUnivariate analysis of factors potentially affecting Overall Survival (OS) are shown in Table\u00a02. OS was 38% (CI 30\u201346%) at 2 years post-transplant and 25% (CI 17\u201332%) at 5 years (Fig.\u00a01a). There was no difference in OS between male and female patients. OS at 5 years was significantly superior when HLA-identical sibling donors were used for both transplants, compared to other donor types (35% (24\u201346%) vs. 9% (0\u201317%), p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a01b). Significantly inferior OS was also seen in those who proceeded to a second allo-HCT within 2 years when compared to those who were re-transplanted more than 2 years later (10% (1\u201320%) vs. 31% (21\u201340%) at 5 years, P\u2009=\u20090.005) (Fig.\u00a01c).Table 2 Univariate analysis for overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse and non-relapse mortality in patients transplanted

analysis of factors potentially affecting Progression-Free Survival (PFS) are shown in Table\u00a02.\n\nPFS was 17% (CI 10\u201323%) at 2 years post transplant and 6% (1\u201311%) at 5 years (Fig.\u00a01d). There was no significant difference in PFS between male and female patients. PFS was significantly superior at 2 years when HLA-identical sibling donors were used for both transplants (24% (15\u201334%) vs. 3% (0\u20137%), p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a01e). Significantly inferior PFS at 24 months was seen in those who proceeded to a second allo-HCT within 2 years (9% (0\u201318%) vs. 20% (12\u201328%), p\u2009=\u20090.02) (Fig.\u00a01f).\n\nRelapse incidence/non-relapse mortality\n\nRelapse Incidence (RI) and NRM rates in patients transplanted for relapsed MM are shown in Table\u00a02. The RI and NRM at 2 and 5 years are shown in Fig.\u00a02a.Fig. 2 Relapse incidence and NRM rates following a second allogeneic transplant for relapsed myeloma and factors affecting these outcomes.\n\na Cumulative incidence of relapse (solid line) and non-relapse mortality (dashed line) over 5 years in patients whose second allo-HCT was for relapsed myeloma. b Cumulative incidence of relapse (solid line) and non-relapse mortality (dashed line) over 5 years based on the type of stem cell donor (HLA-HLA) in patients whose second allo-HCT was for relapsed myeloma. c Cumulative incidence of relapse (solid line) and non-relapse mortality (dashed line) over 5 years based on Disease Stage (low or advanced) in patients whose second allo-HCT was for relapsed myeloma. d Cumulative incidence of relapse (solid line) and non-relapse mortality (dashed line) over 5 years based on age of transplant recipient in patients whose second allo-HCT was for relapsed myeloma.\n\nDisease status affected RI and NRM. The incidence of relapse was significantly higher at 2 years (77% (68\u201387%) vs. 57% (44\u201371%)) (p\u2009=\u20090.009) in patients with advanced disease (Fig.\u00a02c). Conversely, the cumulative NRM was significantly higher at 2 years (25% (13\u201337%) vs. 11% (4\u201318%) (p\u2009=\u20090.03)) in patients with low disease burden (Fig.\u00a02c). Older age at second allo-HCT (50\u201370 vs. <50 years) was associated with a higher RI at 2 years (77% (67\u201387%) vs. 56% (43\u201369%), p\u2009=\u20090.021) and the cumulative NRM was significantly higher in younger individuals at 2 years (24% (13\u201335%) vs. 9% (3\u201315%)) (p\u2009=\u20090.018) (Fig.\u00a02d).\n\nMultivariate analysis\n\nMultivariate analysis results are shown in Table\u00a03.Table 3 Multivariate analysis in relapse cohort for overall survival, progression-free survival, and relapse.\n\n\tOverall survival\tProgression-free survival\tRelapse\t\nRisk Factor\tN\tN-event\tHR (95% CI)\tp\tN\tN-event\tHR (95% CI)\tp\tN\tN-event\tHR (95% CI)\tp\t\nTotal\t\t\t\t\t99\t87\t\t\t99\t70\t\t\t\nPatient gender\t\n\u00a0\u2003Male\t65\t49\t\t\t59\t49\t\t\t59\t39\t\t\t\n\u00a0\u2003Female\t45\t36\t0.66 (0.41\u20131.08)\t0.1021\t40\t38\t1.13 (0.71\u20131.79)\t0.6049\t40\t31\t1.21 (0.72\u20132.01)\t0.4689\t\nDonor type\t\n\u00a0\u2003Other\t53\t43\t\t\t44\t38\t\t\t44\t28\t\t\t\n\u00a0\u2003HLA-HLA\t57\t42\t0.4 (0.24\u20130.67)\t<0.001\t55\t49\t0.53 (0.31\u20130.91)\t0.0219\t55\t42\t0.7 (0.39\u20131.27)\t0.2373\t\nDisease stage\t\n\u00a0\u2003Low\t51\t39\t\t\t45\t38\t\t\t45\t26\t\t\t\n\u00a0\u2003Advanced\t59\t46\t0.94 (0.58\u20131.53)\t0.8145\t54\t49\t1.28 (0.79\u20132.07)\t0.3216\t54\t44\t1.85 (1.05\u20133.24)\t0.0327\t\nConditioning\t\n\u00a0\u2003Standard\t52\t42\t\t\t45\t40\t\t\t45\t32\t\t\t\n\u00a0\u2003Reduced\t58\t43\t0.85 (0.55\u20131.32)\t0.4654\t54\t47\t1.03 (0.66\u20131.59)\t0.9093\t54\t38\t1.09 (0.67\u20131.79)\t0.7297\t\nPrevious GvHD\t\n\u00a0\u2003No previous GvHD\t52\t43\t\t\t46\t44\t\t\t46\t37\t\t\t\n\u00a0\u2003Any previous GvHD\t58\t42\t0.68 (0.42\u20131.1)\t0.1165\t53\t43\t0.71 (0.44\u20131.15)\t0.1614\t53\t33\t0.66 (0.38\u20131.14)\t0.1338\t\n\u00a0Age (decades)\t110\t85\t1.22 (0.89\u20131.68)\t0.2055\t99\t87\t1.09 (0.79\u20131.51)\t0.5831\t99\t70\t1.28 (0.88\u20131.86)\t0.2013\t\n\u00a0Interval to T\u2009x\u20092\t110\t85\t0.98 (0.9\u20131.07)\t0.6776\t99\t87\t0.94 (0.86\u20131.03)\t0.1945\t99\t70\t0.88 (0.79\u20130.98)\t0.0186\t\nBold values indicate statistical significance p < 0.05.\n\nWhen adjusting for the indicated covariates, patients who received both their first and second transplants from HLA-identical siblings had better OS (HR\u2009=\u20090.4 (0.24\u20130.67), p\u2009<\u20090.001) and PFS (HR\u2009=\u20090.53 (0.31\u20130.91)) than other combinations.

A total of 14% of patients in whom data was available were conditioned with Cyclophosphamide \u00b1ATG or Alemtuzumab.\n\nGVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin-based approaches in 93% of patients in whom data was available, including cyclosporin and methotrexate (MTX) (28%), cyclosporin and MMF (26%) and single agent cyclosporin (30%).\n\nGraft-versus-host disease\n\nIn the first 100 days following the second allo-HCT, the rate of grade II acute GvHD was 12% (3\u201322%)), grade III\u2013IV acute GVHD 15% (5\u201325%)) and death without GvHD 17% (6\u201327%)). The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD was 36% (21\u201351%)) and death without chronic GvHD 41% (25\u201356%)).\n\nOverall survival and progression-free survival\n\nOS was 41% (CI 28\u201354%) and PFS 34% (CI 21\u201347%) at 2 years post-transplant (Fig.\u00a03a). Univariate analysis of factors potentially affecting OS and PFS is shown in Table\u00a04. None of these factors affected outcomes.

shown in Table\u00a04 and Fig.\u00a03b. After 2 years, the cumulative RI was 32% (19\u201345%)) and NRM 34% (21\u201347%). The 2-year incidence of relapse based on disease stage is shown in Fig.\u00a03c.\n\nIn addition, NRM at 2 years was higher in those with a low disease burden when compared to those with an advanced disease burden ((50% (31\u201369%) vs. 12% (0\u201327%) (p\u2009=\u20090.016) (Fig.\u00a03d).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis is the first registry report of outcomes following second allo-HCT in patients with myeloma. In this analysis, the indications for re-transplantation fell into two groups: relapse and graft failure. In the relapse group, OS was 38% at 2 years and 25% at 5 years. This is marginally better than the aggregate 20% 5-year OS rate reported by Ruutu and colleagues for all 2632\u2009second allogeneic transplants performed in EBMT centres for disease relapse between 1994 and 2009 [13]. In that EBMT registry study, the use of a HLA-identical sibling donor for the second transplant was found to be a favourable predictive factor for OS with a 5-year OS probability of 22% as opposed to 17% using either other related or unrelated donors (P\u2009=\u20090.012). However, whether the same or a new donor was used for the second transplant appeared to make no difference.\n\nIn order to more clearly assess these overlapping and potentially confounding categories (HLA-matched versus non-HLA-matched, same donor versus change of donor), we focused on the outcomes of patients who had received both their first and second transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors. Based on the available registry data, over four-fifths of these patients had the same HLA-identical sibling donor for the two transplants.\n\nIn our cohort, patients who had two consecutive HLA-identical sibling donor transplants had better PFS at 2 years (24% vs. 3%, p\u2009=\u2009<0.001) and OS at 5 years (35% vs. 9%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). This was confirmed on multivariate analysis with patients receiving both their first and second transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors having better OS (HR\u2009=\u20090.4 (0.2\u20130.7), p\u2009<\u20090.001) and PFS (0.5 (0.3\u20130.9), p\u2009=\u20090.022). Conversely, there were no survivors among the eight patients who had the same donor of any other category (all donor types except for HLA-identical sibling) for both transplants. The positive effect of keeping the same donor, therefore, appears to depend on the specific donor type rather than the individual stem cell donor. One interpretation of these results might be that any additional alloimmune effect conferred by the use of an unrelated donor in transplantation for myeloma is outweighed by greater NRM. In those relapsed patients who had developed acute grade II-IV GVHD following their first allo-HCT, there was a significantly higher incidence of acute grade II\u2013IV GvHD when the same HLA identical sibling donor was used again (50% vs. 22%, p\u2009=\u20090.03).\n\nAmong patients who have a second allo-HCT for relapsed disease, those with shorter remissions following their first transplant have consistently been reported to have poorer outcomes [5, 6, 12, 18, 19]. This likely reflects both the earlier relapse of biologically more aggressive disease and the cumulative effect of treatment-related toxicity. The median interval between transplants in our relapse cohort was over 3 years. Those patients with relapsed disease who proceeded to a second allo-HCT within 2 years had a shorter PFS at 2 years (9% vs. 20%, p\u2009=\u20090.02) as well as a poorer OS at 5 years (10% vs. 31%, p\u2009=\u20090.005) when compared to those transplanted more than 2 years later. Also consistent with past reports, the relapse incidence at 2 years was higher (77% vs. 57%, p\u2009=\u20090.009) in patients whose disease was in less than a partial remission pre-transplant, when compared to those with a lower disease burden prior to the second transplant [6].\n\nThe use of either myeloablative conditioning or RIC prior to a first allo-HCT in patients with myeloma was recently reported to result in similar outcomes [20, 21]. Most of the acute leukemia literature favours the use of RIC in second allogeneic transplants due to lower NRM. In our relapse cohort, 59% of the first and 55% of the second transplants were performed following RIC. In the graft failure cohort, the equivalent percentages were 79% and 69%, respectively. Relapse was more common in older patients (50\u201370 years) though this did not reflect the intensity of conditioning as there was no difference in the frequency of use of reduced intensity conditioning approaches between the younger and older cohorts.\n\nThe causes of death differed between the relapse and graft failure cohorts. A total of 55% of the relapse group died of \u2018relapse/disease progression\u2019 as opposed to 20% of infection and 3% of organ damage/failure and toxicity. In the graft failure group, 23% died of subsequent relapse/disease progression, 32% of infection and 16% of organ damage/failure and toxicity. The shorter time between transplants and the prolonged neutropenia in the setting of graft failure are likely factors in this increased toxicity.\n\nIn the graft failure group, OS was 41% at 2 years. The NRM rate at 2 years in those patients whose myeloma was in a partial remission or better pre-transplant, was 50.2% (31\u201369%) compared to 12% (0\u201327%) in patients with a higher disease burden (p\u2009=\u20090.016). No other variable was found to significantly affect outcomes though this may partially reflect the relatively small patient cohort.\n\nAlthough second allo-HCT is feasible in myeloma patients, OS outcomes remain poor. There is a need for strategies to achieve deeper remissions prior to any second allo-HCT. A focus on novel maintenance strategies to reduce the risk of relapse is also required [22, 23]. In a CIBMTR comparison of post-relapse OS after autologous/allogeneic (auto/allo) as opposed to tandem autologous (auto/auto) transplantation between 2000 and 2010, there was superior OS following relapse in auto/allo HCT recipients compared with auto/auto HCT recipients [24]. The authors contended that this reflected a better response to salvage with agents such as immunomodulatory drugs in the context of donor-derived immunity. This detailed information is unfortunately not available to allow us to analyse the relevance of such factors in our cohort. Nonetheless, small molecule inhibitors and novel immunotherapies have the potential to change the kinetics of disease relapse, thereby facilitate an emerging alloimmune graft-versus-malignancy response post transplant.\n\nMyeloma patients who relapse post-transplant often retain full donor chimerism. In this setting, Novak and colleagues reported on second \u201callogeneic\u201d transplants using CD34+ selected donor cells without immunosuppression followed by DLI and/or maintenance therapy as a means of achieving disease control [17]. Myeloablative conditioning was well tolerated with no NRM and no GVHD. OS was 100% at 1 year and 69% at 2 years though PFS was only 13% at 2 years.\n\nThis may represent another salvage treatment option in selected patients.\n\nThere are some weaknesses in our study. The disease staging system, an EBMT remission-based classification, is not specific to myeloma and it is surprising that there is no difference in OS or PFS between those with \u2018Low\u2019 as opposed to \u2018Advanced\u2019 disease. It is possible that the very high rates of post-transplant relapse\u2013\u2013overall PFS was 6% (1\u201311%) at 5 years in patients transplanted for relapsed myeloma\u2013\u2013may have masked any PFS difference. In addition, OS will have been affected by subsequent salvage treatments. However, there is a signal of their \u2018Advanced\u2019 disease status is that these patients have a significantly higher relapse rate on both univariate and multivariate analysis.\n\nIn summary, one quarter of myeloma patients remained alive 5 years following a second allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant with similar outcomes seen following disease relapse and graft failure. The best outcomes (35% OS at 5 years) were seen in those who had two consecutive HLA-identical sibling donor transplants.\n\nContributors\n\nYves Beguin, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium; Jean Henri Bourhis, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France; Peter Dreger, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Franca Fagioli, Onco-Ematologia Pediatrica, Torino, Italy; J\u00fcrgen Finke, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Labussi\u00e8re-Wallet, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Lyon, France; Matjaz Sever, University Med.

Introduction\n\nChromoblastomycosis is a neglected endemic fungal disease that leads to chronic cutaneous and subcutaneous mycoses. Such mycoses are highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, especially Asia, Latin America, and Madagascar [1,2,3]. These infections predominantly affect active immunocompetent adult males working in agricultural fields and are generally acquired through accidental inoculation of plant- or soil-associated fungi by thorns or wound contamination [4]. The disease hallmark is the presence of single or clustered muriform cells, also called fumagoid cells, sclerotic cells or Medlar bodies embedded in a granulomatous and suppurative tissue, that serve as invasive forms in living tissue. This is the most predominant form, which triggers an intense inflammatory pattern responsible for the chronic inflammatory reaction seen in most patients [5]. Chromoblastomycosis must be distinguished from the closely related phaeohyphomycosis, which is globally distributed and more commonly responsible for rapidly evolving multiple lesions in immunosuppressed hosts, in whom typically muriform elements are not detected. We describe the case of an immunosuppressed patient diagnosed with foot chromoblastomycosis due to an uncommon dematiaceous fungus.\n\n2. Case Report\n\nA 52-year-old Congolese woman presented to our hospital with a painful lesion located on the external side of the left foot that had been evolving for two months. The unique abscess-like lesion measured 2 cm in diameter and produced a chronic sero-hematic discharge.\n\nIn her medical history, the patient had had a kidney transplant two years before and still received tacrolimus (15.5 mg/d), mycophenolate mofetil (1 g/d), and corticosteroid (5 mg/d). No trauma to the lower limbs was reported during the previous months. She lived in France and had not returned to the Congo over the previous eight years. At the time of the initial consultation, she had just returned from a trip to Morocco, where she had spent a few months.\n\nThe first skin biopsy was poorly contributory due to superficial sampling. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of a single fungal hypha with no clear distinction between yeast or filamentous fungus.\n\nThree months later (5 months after lesion onset), the lesion grew lumpy and tumoral with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, reaching 3 cm and becoming increasingly disabling (Figure 1). No evidence of sporotrichoid inflammation or systemic dissemination was found. An X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging of the foot revealed a dermo-hypodermic polylobed mass syndrome with no osteitis lesions. The patient remained in good general condition, with no fever or biological inflammatory syndrome.\n\nHistologically, the skin biopsy revealed a deep abscessed lesion composed of many altered polynuclear cells, histiocytes, and a few giant cells. Numerous dark pigmented fungal spores and inconsistently branched swollen filaments of varying size, evocative of phaeohyphomycosis, were observed, Figure 2a. Concomitantly, mycological examination of potassium hydroxide mounts revealed the presence of many dematiaceous muriform cells. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of such pathognomonic muriform elements within the tissue, sometimes organized as chains, thus clarifying the diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis, Figure 2b.\n\nMycological cultures from both skin biopsies grew in 10 days, with numerous dark pigmented colonies, Figure 3a, yielding poor microscopic features. Smooth black hyphae with no remarkable fructifications were observed, apart from large echinulate chlamydospores and balloon-like filaments appearing in older cultures Figure 3b.\n\nMolecular sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and 28S (LSU) regions of the ribosomal DNA was performed and the nucleotide sequences deposited in Genbank (ITS: MZ380314 and LSU: MZ380317). Comparison with fungal species from the Genbank database showed a high percentage of identity matches with the Dothideomycetes class, especially with Kirschsteiniotheliales, such as Kirschsteiniothelia spp. (88\u201395%), Taeniolella exilis (94.6%), and Dendryphiopsis spp. (89.13\u201389.48%). A phylogenetic analysis of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequence was performed (Figure 4), showing that the sequenced isolate was a member of Kirschsteiniotheliales (Dothideomycetes) and unrelated to the Chaetotyriales taxon (Eurotiomycetes), of which most species commonly responsible for chromoblastomycosis belong. However, no reliable species identification could be attributed, probably because this fungus has never been described.\n\nAs there was no local spreading, nor to the bone, excision surgery of the entire lesion was performed, and the patient received post-operative antifungal therapy with liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg) for 10 days. Clinical follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment showed complete healing of the lesion, despite the persistence of residual difficulty in walking for a few months due to a hyperkeratosis reaction at the resection scar.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nSeveral possible causes of abscess-like skin lesion were considered for this immunocompromised patient, such as carcinoma, Kaposi disease, or an infectious abscess, but the fungal origin of the disease was rapidly confirmed. However, the accurate mycological diagnosis was complicated due to (i) the absence of typical muriform cells on first examination, (ii) the absence of obvious vegetal foot trauma, and iii) the absence of 100% matching DNA sequences in current mycological databases, which prevented us from precisely identifying the fungal species and, thus, from experience-guided therapeutic management.\n\nFrom a mycological point of view, this is the first case of histopathology-proven chromoblastomycosis caused by a dematiaceous fungus not belonging to the Chaetotyriales order (Eurotiomycetes)\u2014in particular, the Herpetrichiellaceae family, which includes the well-known genera Fonsecaea, Cladophialophora, Rhinocladiella, and Exophiala. Several unexpected agents, such as Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhytidhysteron spp., Chaetomium funicola, and Catenulostroma chromoblastomycosum, have been previously shown to be responsible for chromoblastomycosis-like skin lesions, albeit with no evidence of muriform cells in most cases [6]. Interestingly, Nishi et al. recently reported the first human infection due to a phenotypically similar mold, identified as the Kirschsteiniothelia species, in a Japanese patient presenting with infectious ankle bursitis [7] with no clinical presentation of chromoblastomycosis. Although phenotypically similar, the isolate analyzed in our study shares less than 90% DNA similarity with their strain, suggesting that it is a species that has never been described.\n\nRecently introduced, the Kirschsteiniotheliales order is comprised of a diverse panel of environmental saprophytic species isolated from decaying wood, herbaceous debris, soil, and water. The few environmental reports of Kirschsteiniothelia come from Asia [8] and Europe, especially from the South of France and Spain [9,10,11]. In our case, it is likely that the patient was infected in Morocco by walking barefoot and inoculation with an imperceptible splinter that went unnoticed at the time.\n\nMelanized saprophytic fungi are distributed worldwide, especially in extreme conditions, including in decaying wood or leaves and soil. Although the pathogenicity of such dematiaceous fungi is generally considered to be limited, they probably possess the properties required for virulence towards plant or human tissues and low susceptibility to antifungals [12]. There are very scarce data on the antifungal susceptibility of Kirschsteiniotheliales due to their rare involvement in human infections, as well as technical issues related to their slow growth in vitro. A Kirschsteiniothelia spp. isolate was tested by Nishi et al. and showed a high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against most of the usual antifungals, such as triazoles (>8 \u00b5g/mL for itraconazole and voriconazole), amphotericin B (>16 \u00b5g/mL), and echinocandins (0.5 \u00b5g/mL and 4 \u00b5g/mL, for micafungin and caspofungin, respectively) [7]. By contrast, the MIC against 5-fluorocytosin, which can be combined with azoles, was low (0.12 \u00b5g/mL). In any case, such low overall antifungal susceptibility supports the need to include physical treatment in the management of chromoblastomycosis, e.g., thermotherapy or phototherapy, when early surgical excision of the initial lesion is not performed [13].\n\nChromoblastomycosis still presents a true therapeutic challenge due to the recalcitrant nature of the disease, prone to frequent recurrence. The present case was successfully treated as a result of surgery and early medical management and the absence of bone involvement, but the evolution of the disease in this transplant patient could have been dramatic.\n\nIn conclusion, this original case illustrates the potential diversity of environmental dematiaceous fungi responsible for phaeohyphomycosis, especially chromoblastomycosis, and the need to send samples to mycology lab for appropriate diagnosis.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Dea Garcia-Hermoso (Institut Pasteur, Paris) for her kind advice.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nH.G. contributed to the microbiological diagnosis, carried out the scientific literature search, wrote the manuscript, and developed the figures.

Therefore, they are at increased risk of developing vascular complications of the access site.\n\nWe report the case of a 63\u2010year\u2010old patient hospitalized for COVID\u201019 pneumonia requiring noninvasive mechanical ventilation, who developed arterial rupture of a small aneurysm following arterial catheterization.\n\n2 CASE DESCRIPTION\n\nPatient's consent was obtained to the anonymous use of his clinical data for research purposes.\n\nA 63\u2010year\u2010old man with a medical history of myocardial surgical revascularization was admitted to our hospital for a COVID\u201019 pneumonia, which required ventilatory support until the need to wear a continuous positive airways pressure (c\u2010PAP) mask up to 60% FiO2 at day 4. Therapy with hydroxychloroquine 400\u00a0mg twice a day, lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100\u00a0mg twice a day and antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone 2\u00a0g daily and azithromycin 500\u00a0mg daily was set up, according to the internal protocol. Moreover, a 4 French catheter (BD Medical\u2122) was placed in his right radial artery for the arterial blood gas analyses, without any troubles. Then, he received a single dose of tocilizumab 640\u00a0mg and started methylprednisolone (40\u00a0mg twice a day). The respiratory function progressively improved until a complete weaning from the c\u2010PAP in day 10. The radial artery catheter was removed after 8\u00a0days in day 12 without any complications, and local compression was applied to the wrist. However, on day 14 a painful tumefaction in his right wrist, which extended to the forearm was found. The upper limb was warm, motility and sensitivity of the hand were preserved, and both radial and ulnar pulses were palpable. Doppler ultrasonography showed the presence of edema of the forearm extending to the arm, and the regular patency of the arterial and venous axis of the right upper limb, with regular flows and without any hematoma surrounding the artery, which had a regular caliber. A slight compression of the upper limb was then applied with a bandage.\n\nHowever, on day 16 the clinical picture worsened (Figure\u00a01) and the patient complained of continuous pain of his forearm with initial impairment of the sensitivity and the motility of his right hand. Doppler ultrasonography was repeated, showing the presence of a small aneurysm of the radial artery at the wrist. The patient then underwent a right upper limb computed tomography angiography (CTA), which confirmed the presence of a focal ectasia of the radial artery of 6\u00a0mm (reference diameter of the artery above the ectasia was 4.5\u00a0mm), with edematous infiltration of the surrounding tissue and inflammation of the flexor muscles of the forearm (Figure\u00a02). Blood cultures were negative; nevertheless, antibiotic therapy with daptomycin 10\u00a0mg/kg/day was set according to the infectivologist's suggestion, but 2\u00a0days later active bleeding from the right wrist suddenly occurred. Manual compression was unsuccessful; therefore, emergent surgery was performed. In the operating room, while keeping manual compression in the radial position at the distal third of the forearm, a right longitudinal incision was performed laterally at the wrist. A wide hematoma with active bleeding from the radial artery was found. The artery was completely lacerated (Figure\u00a03A). Due to the impossibility of proceeding with arterial reconstruction, surgical ligation was performed with 5/0 polypropylene suture. Fasciotomies of the flexor muscles' lodge were also performed, in order to decompress the underlying median nerve which appeared to be edematous (Figure\u00a03B). Adjunctive intermetacarpal fasciotomies on the back of the hand were performed at I, II, and III space, with immediate decongestion of the edematous component and good refill on all the fingers (Figure\u00a03C). Intraoperative culture of both the endothelium and the surrounding tissue was negative for the presence of any bacterial agent.\n\nFIGURE 1 Pictures of the clinical presentation of the patient's right wrist (image on the left side). Note the edema extending to the forearm (image on the right side)\n\nFIGURE 2 Right upper limb CTA showing a focal ectasia of the radial artery of 6\u00a0mm (red arrow), with edematous infiltration of the surrounding tissue and inflammation of the flexor muscles of the forearm\n\nFIGURE 3 Intraoperative finding of laceration of the radial artery A. Note in figure B the fasciotomies of the flexor muscles' lodge at the level of the third middle\u2010distal of the forearm, and at the transverse ligament of the carpus. Figure C shows intermetacarpal fasciotomies on the back of the hand at I, II, and III space, with immediate decongestion of the edematous component\n\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, with complete recover of sensitivity and motility of the hand. A duplex ultrasound was performed in the first postoperative day, showing adequate vascularization of the interdigital arteries, supplied by a regularly patent ulnar artery.\n\nThe patient was then discharged in good clinical conditions on day 28.\n\n3 DISCUSSION\n\nRadial artery catheterization is a common maneuver, which is usually performed for invasive arterial pressure monitoring, 2 for endovascular and cardiac percutaneous procedures 3 or when there is the need for frequent arterial blood gas determination, such as in COVID\u201019 patients.\n\nIndwelling radial artery catheters are generally safe, with an overall rate of associated vascular complications lower than 0.5%, being radial thrombosis the most reported. 4\n\nFurthermore, aneurysmal degeneration after radial artery catheterization has been reported in less than 0.1% of the cases, 5 and radial artery rupture after arterial catheterization has been occasionally described. 6\n\nIn our case report, the patient had a small radial aneurysm, which was, however, complicated by sudden rupture, despite antibiotic treatment and the not excessive size of the lesion. Some pathogenic mechanisms hypothetically could have contributed together to the development of such a complication.\n\nFirst, the reduced local immune defenses following the administration of immunosuppressive drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and corticosteroids, needed for the COVID\u201019 pneumonia, may have contributed to a possible local infection, even if the intraoperative cultures of the endothelium were negative.\n\nAs a second issue, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection itself may have played a role in the impairment of the arterial wall. Recently published papers have described a significant increase in vascular disorders in COVID\u201019 patients. 1 Furthermore, recent studies have shown direct viral infection of the endothelial cells through the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 receptor, and diffuse endothelial inflammation that can result in widespread endothelial dysfunction. 7\n\nMoreover, the so\u2010called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that is typical of severe COVID\u201019 infection also can cause arterial wall weakening and fragility which further cause arterial rupture or aneurysm formation. 8\n\nTherefore, vascular surgeons should be alert in patients with COVID\u201019, bearing in mind that arterial complications may occur not only in the form of ischemic diseases but also as hemorrhagic complications following even small aneurysm.\n\n4 CONCLUSION\n\nSmall radial aneurysms following arterial catheterization may be complicated by sudden rupture in patients with COVID\u201019. Vascular surgeons should, therefore, be aware of such complication to prevent potentially serious consequences.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nNone declared.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nDM: involved in study design, data collection, writing, critical revision, and final approval.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nCase Report: Identification of a Novel GNAS Mutation and 1p/22q Co-Deletion in a Patient With Multiple Recurrent Meningiomas Sensitive to Sunitinib.\n\nABSTRACT:\nAlthough surgical resection can cure the majority of meningiomas, there are still approximately 20% of patients suffering from an aggressive course with recurrence or progression. In this study, we reported a novel GNAS mutation and 1p/22q co-deletion responding to sunitinib in a patient with multiple recurrent meningiomas.\nA 53-year-old woman with meningioma was hospitalized due to postoperative tumor progression for 3 weeks. WHO grade I meningioma was pathologically diagnosed after the first three surgeries, but the second recurrence occurred approximately 3 years following the third surgery. Next-generation sequencing was performed on the first two recurrent samples. GNAS mutations and 1p/22q co-deletion were both identified, and amplification at 17q and chromosome 19 was also found in the second recurrent sample, based on which WHO grade II/III meningioma was diagnosed. The lesion in the left cerebellopontine angle area enlarged after use of radiotherapy combined with temozolomide chemotherapy for 2 months. When sunitinib was added, the residual lesions began to lessen and continuously reduced.\nThis typical case suggested that timely molecular diagnosis for refractory meningiomas contributed to guiding the molecular classification and clinicians to make more reasonable individualized therapeutic regimens, consequently benefiting the patients. This case report also highlighted the potential role of sunitinib in the treatment of refractory meningiomas.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nMeningiomas primarily arising from meningothelial arachnoid cells are the most common intracranial tumors at present, with an estimated annual prevalence of 8.83 cases per 0.1 million people in the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (1). Although surgical resection can cure the majority of meningiomas, there are still approximately 20% of patients suffering from an aggressive course with recurrence or progression, leading to increased morbidity and mortality (2).\n\nWith advances in the molecular characterization of meningiomas, the genetic aberrations that may be potential treatment targets and those representing an elevated risk of tumor recurrence have been identified. Apart from NF2 alterations in sporadic meningiomas, various oncogenic mutations in KLF4, SMO, TRAF7, PIK3CA, AKT1 and POLR2A are also found to be clinically actionable genetic events in meningiomas (3\u20135). Additionally, mutations in AKT1, SMO and TERT promoter may indicate an increased likelihood of tumor recurrence (6, 7). Although surgery and/or irradiation are the major treatment modality for aggressive and/or recurrent meningiomas, these new genetic findings provide potential targets for drug treatment. Here, we shared a novel GNAS mutation and 1p/22q deletion responding to sunitinib in a patient with multiple recurrent meningiomas.\n\nCase Presentation\n\nA 53-year-old woman with meningioma was admitted to our hospital due to postoperative tumor progression for 3 weeks. In May 2008, she had decreased hearing in the left ear, abnormal secretion in the left nasal cavity and a water-flow sensation in the laryngopharyngeal wall. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a space-occupying lesion between the left cavernous sinus and the left pterygopalatine fossa (Figure 1A). In June 2008, she underwent meningioma resection in orbitozygomatic-infratemporal approach (Figure 1B). Immunohistochemical results showed EMA (+), CK (-), Vimentin (+) and Ki-67 (5%). The pathological diagnosis was WHO grade I endothelial meningioma. Postoperatively, the patient still had decreased hearing, facial paralysis, fixed eyeballs and facial numbness in the left side, and discharged from hospital after recovery.\n\nFigure 1 Changes of the pre- and post-operative meningioma. Before (A) and after (B) the first surgery, 2008-06; Before (C) and after (D) the second surgery, 2009-01; Before (E) and after (F) the third surgery, 2016-05; Before (G) and after (H) the fourth surgery, 2019-09. The red arrow points to the tumor.\n\nIn January 2009, MRI revealed a residual tumor (Figure 1C), thus the tumor resection in the left nasopharyngeal wall was performed (Figure 1D). Immunohistochemical results indicated EMA (+) and Vimentin (+). WHO grade I transitional meningioma was diagnosed according to pathological results. Postoperatively, the left facial paralysis, fixed eyeballs and facial numbness of the patient were almost the same as before, and gradually improved after rehabilitation exercises.\n\nIn January 2016, the patient started to have headache and dizziness accompanied by left blurred vision. One month later, MRI showed a recurrent tumor involving cavernous sinus in the left cerebellopontine angle area (Figure 1E). In May 2016, partial excision of meningioma in the left skull base was conducted (Figure 1F). Immunohistochemical results showed EMA (+), Vimentin (+), GFAP (-), PR (+) and Ki-67 (5%). WHO grade I transitional meningioma was pathologically diagnosed. Postoperatively, headache and dizziness relieved, without obviously aggravated left blurred vision. The patient refused to receive adjuvant radiotherapy due to personal reasons. Further consultations indicated stable disease.\n\nIn July 2019, the patient had mild swelling in the left canthus, soft in texture. One month later, MRI indicated a recurrent tumor with distant diffusion (Figure 1G). In September 2019, cranio-orbital resection of space-occupying lesions based on the right fronto-orbital-zygomatic initial incision was performed under general anesthesia (Figure 1H). Through immunohistochemistry, it was found S-100 (-), Vimentin (+), EMA (+), ER (-), PR (+), SSTR2a (+), E-Cadherin (+), INI-1 (+), Ki-67 (5%-15%), EGFR\u00a0(+++) and GFAP (-). The pathological results showed WHO grade I-II transitional meningioma. The patient did not receive further treatment after surgery.\n\nOn July 23, 2020, tumor progression was observed. The patient came to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Her symptoms, such as left decreased hearing, left facial numbness, right deviated corners of the mouth and limited left eye movement in vertical direction, were the same as before. MRI showed an abnormal enhancement ratio in the relative left brainstem and an enhanced lesion under the cerebellar tentorium, suggesting tumor recurrence and distant diffusion (Figures 2A, B). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on the first two recurrent samples, and somatic inactivating mutations in GNAS gene and 1p/22q co-deletion were both identified. Additionally, amplification at 17q and chromosome 19 was also found in the second recurrent sample. These findings suggested high-grade meningioma (WHO grade II/III). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (prescribed dose: 40 Gy/20f, temozolomide: 75 mg/m2) was applied on August 20, 2020. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) boost was used for lesions under the tentorium of cerebellum (8 Gy) and in the left cerebellopontine angle area (5 Gy) on September 18, 2020. Two months after chemoradiotherapy, the lesion in the left cerebellopontine angle area enlarged (Figures 2C, D), which might be associated with response to radiotherapy in a short term. Then, sunitinib (50 mg/d) was orally administrated in combination with temozolomide chemotherapy, the residual lesions lessened after use of 2 months (Figures 2E, F). Sunitinib was totally applied for four treatment courses, in which 6 weeks were as one treatment course. To date of June 9, 2021, MRI showed continued partial remission of residual lesions (Figures 2G, H). The patient was in good condition, and symptoms like facial paralysis and fixed eyeballs improved. The treatment timeline of the patient is depicted in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 2 Changes of meningioma at different shooting angles of MRI. (A, B) Meningioma recurred on 2020-07-23; (C, D) The lesions in the left cerebellopontine angle area enlarged on 2020-10-28; (E, F) The residual lesions lessened on 2020-12-24; (G, H) The residual lesions continuously reduced on 2021-06-09. The red arrow points to the tumor.\n\nFigure 3 The treatment timeline of the patient with multiple recurrent meningiomas.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAlthough most meningiomas are benign and have good outcomes after surgical resection, a small subset of them is likely to recur, which requires repeated surgeries, radiation and medical treatments (8). Recently, emerging evidence has revealed the association of recurrent mutations with a particular clinicopathological phenotype in meningiomas, and the updated WHO classification of brain tumors has also incorporated some important molecular findings (2, 9). The case in our study was pathologically diagnosed as WHO grade I meningioma with an extremely low 5-year recurrence rate after the first three surgeries, but recurrence occurred approximately 3 years following the third surgery. Through genetic testing, GNAS mutations and 1p/22q co-deletion were both identified in the first two recurrent samples.\n\nGNAS, a crucial signal transduction protein, can activate adenylate cyclase during the signal transduction of G-protein-coupled receptors, leading to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels (10). GNAS is mutationally activated in various cancer types, such as growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, while has inactivating mutations in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (11, 12). In our study, this inactivating GNAS mutation was first found in meningioma. However, whether this mutation affects meningioma progression needs more studies to confirm.\n\nStructural and numerical chromosome variations are accompanied by more aggressive features of meningiomas, most significantly 1p deletion, and the deletion of the distal part of 1p is correlated with meningioma progression (2, 13). Moreover, aberrations of several other chromosomes, such as 22q, 6q, 14q and 17q, are reported to involve in meningioma development and progression (14). Although WHO grade I meningioma was pathologically diagnosed in our study after the third surgery, 1p/22q co-deletion was detected at molecular levels, suggesting a probability of tumor recurrence. The patient should be followed up closely. Compared with the first recurrence, the second recurrence was accompanied by more chromosomal variations including amplification at 17q and chromosome 19, which highlighted more complicated changes of molecular genetics in the second recurrent sample. These genetic findings provided the evidence for WHO grade II/III meningioma.\n\nThe patient experienced 3 recurrences in total after 4 surgeries, which might be associated with absence of positive adjuvant therapies including SRS that are known to have high rates of tumor control when used to small tumor remnants (15). Based on the results of molecular diagnosis, the regimen of radiotherapy plus temozolomide chemotherapy + anti-angiogenic targeted therapy was made. However, the patient rejected to receive anti-angiogenic targeted therapy until an enlarged lesion appeared, and the residual lesions significantly lessened after use of sunitinib. As an orally administered small tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, sunitinib has been demonstrated active in patients with recurrent malignant meningioma in a phase II trial where the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in the cohort of anaplastic and atypical meningiomas was 42% and the expression of VEGFR2 in the tumor tissue was associated with favorable PFS (16). Moreover, sunitinib showed similar efficacy and safety in the systemic management of refractory meningiomas compared with octreotide/everolimus (17).\n\nIn conclusion, this typical case suggested that timely molecular diagnosis for refractory meningiomas contributed to guiding the molecular classification and clinicians to make more reasonable individualized therapeutic regimens, consequently benefiting the patients. This case report also highlighted the potential role of sunitinib in the treatment of refractory meningiomas. Whether the effect of sunitinib on refractory meningiomas will be translated into improved disease progression including improved PFS and overall survival is yet to be determined.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary materials.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nLong term follow-up of pediatric-onset Evans syndrome: broad immunopathological manifestations and high treatment burden.\n\nABSTRACT:\nPediatric-onset Evans syndrome (pES) is defined by both immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) before the age of 18 years. There have been no comprehensive long-term studies of this rare disease, which can be associated to various immunopathological manifestations (IMs). We report outcomes of the 151 patients with pES and more than 5 years of follow-up from the nationwide French prospective OBS'CEREVANCE cohort. Median age at final follow-up was 18.5 (6.8-50.0) years and the median follow-up period was 11.3 (5.1-38.0) years. At 10 years, ITP and AIHA were in sustained complete remission in 54.5% and 78.4% of patients, respectively. The frequency and number of clinical and biological IMs increased with age: at 20 years old, 74% had at least one clinical cIM. A wide range of cIMs occurred, mainly lymphoproliferation, dermatological, gastrointestinal/hepatic and pneumological IMs. The number of cIMs was associated with a subsequent increase in the number of second-line treatments received (other than steroids and immunoglobulins; hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.60; p = 0.0002, Cox proportional hazards method). Survival at 15 years after diagnosis was 84%. Death occurred at a median age of 18 (1.7-31.5) years, and the most frequent cause was infection. The number of second-line treatments and severe/recurrent infections were independently associated with mortality. In conclusion, longterm outcomes of pES showed remission of cytopenias but frequent IMs linked to high secondline treatment burden. Mortality was associated to drugs and/or underlying immunodeficiencies, and adolescents-young adults are a high-risk subgroup.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nThe presence of both immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) defines Evans syndrome (ES). Pediatric-onset ES (pES) is a rare disease, and approximately ten new cases are diagnosed every year in France, which has a population of 66 million.1 Since its first description in 1951 by Robert Evans,2 our understanding of pES has been based on small retrospective cohorts with limited follow-up.3-7 In 2004, the French Rare Disease Center CEREVANCE set up the prospective national cohort OBS\u2019CEREVANCE, which includes children with AIHA, chronic ITP persisting for more than 12 months (cITP), and pES.8\n\nPreliminary reports from this cohort and previously published studies showed that pES is a chronic disease with a high rate of relapse for both types of cytopenias. 1,3,4,7,9 Mortality rates across studies have ranged from 7\u201336%.1,3-7 In addition to cytopenias, immunopathological manifestations (IM) such as autoimmune/autoinflammatory organ diseases, lymphoproliferation, and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in 70\u201380% of patients with pES.4,5,8,10 In an undetermined number of cases, pES is thought to be \u201csecondary\u201d and caused by an underlying disease, classically systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS).1,11,12 Recently, genetic analyses found a heterogeneous genetic background in up to 65% of a subset of 80 patients from the OBS\u2019CEREVANCE cohort. These patients carried variants in genes that are linked to primary immunodeficiencies (PID) or involved in immune responses.13\n\nOverall, outcomes and the long-term course of pES are poorly understood. There have been no comprehensive longitudinal studies including both cytopenia and IM. In addition, the transition to adulthood is often particularly challenging for patients with chronic pediatric diseases.14 Adolescents\u2013young adults (AYA) outcomes have not been investigated in patients with pES, and whether the disease improves with age is unknown. In a clinical setting, the possibility to identify high-risk patients would be extremely helpful in the management of this complex disease. Here, we describe the long-term course of hematological IM and treatments received throughout childhood into adulthood in patients with pES from the OBS\u2019CEREVANCE cohort. We aimed to identify clinically relevant factors associated to the occurrence of IM, the number of second-line treatments received and mortality. Particularly, we investigated the impact of the number second-line treatment received and splenectomy on mortality.\n\nMethods\n\nOBS\u2019CEREVANCE prospective national cohort\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in the Online Supplementary Table S1.1,8,15 Data collected have been previously detailed.1,8 Patients were included if <18 years old at first cytopenia diagnosis. The coordinating center gathered and analyzed all data from the medical team in charge in real time, enabling prospective follow-up even after the pediatric-to-adult transition. The CEREVANCE group recommends scheduling clinical and biological follow-up at least every 6-12 months. Some patients underwent genetic analyses, as previously described.13 Written informed consent was obtained from parents and eligible patients. The cohort study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (CPPRB-A; Bordeaux, France) and the database was registered with the national data protection authority (CNIL, 1396823V0).\n\nPatient selection\n\nPatients with pES, defined as the simultaneous (within 1 month) or sequential association of ITP and AIHA, were included if at least 5 years of follow-up data were available after the first cytopenia diagnosis. In order to provide a complete mortality report, all patients, including those with less than 5 years of follow-up data, were included in the survival analyses. The data were extracted on 21 June 2019.\n\nDefinitions\n\nInitial cytopenia refers to the onset of ITP or AIHA (whichever occurred first) and does not take autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) into account. The IM categories were separated in clinical (cIM) and biological (bIM). pES was defined as secondary if a diagnosis of SLE or PID was made during the follow-up period. SLE diagnosis was made according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Classification criteria (SLICC).16 ALPS diagnosis was based on international criteria.17 Second-line treatments were all immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments, including splenectomy but excluding steroids and therapeutic intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Sustained complete remission (CR) was defined as remission persisting until final follow-up, regardless of ongoing treatments.\n\nFor analyses by age, patients were assessed annually from birth (for IM and treatments) or from cytopenia onset (for AIHA and ITP), until final follow-up. Occasional treatments (e.g., splenectomy and rituximab) were considered as ongoing if these occurred during the previous year. Further details are stated in the Online Supplementary Table S1.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nContinuous and categorical variables were compared using Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney non-parametric test and Fisher\u2019s exact test, respectively. Correlations were tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Survival and cumulative incidence estimates were based on the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared using log-rank test. Patients of OBS\u2019CEREVANCE cohort with isolated cITP or AIHA were used for comparison in survival analyses (unpublished data). The Cox proportional hazards method was used to analyze factors associated with time-dependent variables (i.e., time to CR, AIN, cIM, and second-line treatment, as well as survival). The potential cumulative and/or time-dependent nature of variables was taken in account. Proportionality of hazard was assessed for each variable. Logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with severe or recurrent infections. Variables that were statistically significant in the univariate analyses were included in the multivariate analyses. We investigated associations with the following characteristics and events: sex, consanguinity, cIM/cancer in a first-degree relative, age at first and second cytopenia, sequence of cytopenia, AIN, hypogammaglobulinemia, time to ITP/AIHA CR, severe/recurrent infections, number of cIM, number of second-line treatments. The 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) were not adjusted for multiple testing and should not be used to infer definitive effects. All tests were two-sided and a P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R (ver. 4.0; R Development Core Team) and GraphPad Prism (ver. 8; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) software.\n\nResults\n\nPopulation\n\nOf the 216 patients with pES, 151 were included in this study (Online Supplementary Figure S1). They were followed from 25 different centers. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median (min\u2013max) follow-up time from the first cytopenia diagnosis was 11.3 years (range, 5.1\u201338.0 years). Median age at final follow-up was 18.5 years (range, 6.8\u201350.0 years). In 20 cases (15%), follow-up was discontinued because the patient was considered cured (n=11) or lost to follow-up (n=9). Median age at loss to follow-up was 18.4 years (range, 6.8-25.1 years).\n\nHematological outcomes\n\nAIN developed in 43 patients (28.5%). It was diagnosed within 1 month before or after first cytopenia onset in 23 of 43 cases (53.5%), more than 1 month before in two cases (4.7%), and more than 1 month after in 18 cases (41.9%; maximal delay, 12.4 years). In all cases, the diagnosis was made before the age of 18 years (median age, 6.8 years; range, 0.6\u201316.2 years).\n\nITP and AIHA flare rates at 5 years of follow-up were calculated for the 61 alive patients who did not receive a second-line treatment during this period. Forty-eight patients (79%) had experienced an ITP flare and seven (11%) an AIHA flare.\n\nThe proportion of patients achieving sustained CR for ITP and AIHA steadily increased after cytopenia onset (Figure 1A). At 5 and 10 years, ITP was in sustained CR in 40.5% and 62.3% of patients (P=0.02) and AIHA was in sustained CR in 54.5% and 74.1% of patients (P=0.001), respectively. Sustained CR was achieved earlier for AIHA than ITP (median time to CR, 4.0 years vs. 7.0 years; P=0.01). At the final follow-up of the 135 surviving patients, the numbers of patients in CR, partial remission, and no remission were 126 (83%), five (3%), and one (1%) for AIHA and 119 (79%), eight (5%), and five (3%) for ITP, respectively (missing data in three cases). Forty-six patients (34%) had no treatment ongoing at last followup. No particular characteristic was associated with AIHA or ITP CR, including cIM and bIM.\n\nTable 1. Patient characteristics.\n\nOver the first three decades, the proportions of patients achieving sustained CR increased with age (Figure 1B). ITP and AIHA were in CR in 26% and 30% of cases at 10 years compared to 50% and 72% at 20 years, respectively (P<0.001 for both comparisons).\n\nImmunopathological manifestations\n\nA total of 122 of 151 patients (81%) had at least one IM. The data for each category and specific diagnosis are shown in the Online Supplementary Table S2.\n\ncIM developed in 100 of 151 patients (66%). A total of 47 patients (31%) had two or more IM and 22 (15%) patients had three or more IM (Online Supplementary Figure S2A). Patients with no cIM had shorter median follow-up times (9.7 years vs. 13 years; P=0.0002) and were younger when data were collected (15 years vs. 20 years; P<0.0001). A cIM was diagnosed before the first cytopenia in 21 of 100, simultaneously in 13, and after in 66 cases (median delay, 3.7 years [range, 0.2\u201320.5 years]; Figure 2A). Among the 185 cIM, 29 (16%) were diagnosed before any second-line treatment. No cIM category had a statistically significant difference in frequency before and after first second-line treatment. The number of cIM increased with age. At 10 compared to 20 years old, 37% and 74% of patients had at least one cIM and 9% and 34% of patients had at least two cIM, respectively (P<0.001 for both comparisons; Figure 2B).\n\nThe most common cIM categories were lymphoproliferation (n=71), dermatological (n= 26), gastrointestinal/hepatic (n=23) and pneumological manifestations (n=16, Figure 3; Online Supplementary Figure S2B). The most frequent cIM diagnosis are shown in Table 2. Thirteen patients developed a neurological manifestation as previously described.10 Four patients had a hematological malignancy (age at diagnosis): Hodgkin lymphoma (16 years), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (20 years), large granular lymphocytic leukemia (21 years) and angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma (29 years). Older age at ES diagnosis (HR 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.17; P=0.02), cIM/cancer in a firstdegree relative (HR 1.64; 95% CI: 1.1\u20132.4; P=0.006), and the presence of AIN were independently associated with the number of cIM (HR 2.41; 95% CI: 1.5\u20133.8; P=0.0002).\n\nBiological IM (bIM) were diagnosed in 101 of 151 patients (67%), and the frequency of bIM also increased with the age (Figure 2C). Hypogammaglobulinemia was the most frequently diagnosed bIM (n=54), including 44 cases diagnosed prior to any anti-CD20 treatment. Among those 54 patients, 25 (46%) received immunoglobulin replacement therapy. SLE and ALPS biomarkers were present (regardless of whether patients met the diagnostic criteria) in 42 and 24 patients, respectively. At 10 and 20 years of age, 39% and 75% of patients had at least one bIM, respectively (P<0.001).\n\nPatients with bIM were more likely to have cIM (79% vs. 40%; P<0.001), and patients with cIM were more likely to have bIM (80% vs. 41%; P<0.001) but the correlation between the number of bIM and cIM was low (r=0.27; P<0.001).\n\nSecondary pediatric-onset Evans syndrome\n\nIn 37 patients (24.5%), pES eventually revealed a SLE or a PID unknown at cytopenia onset.\n\nEleven patients (7.3%) eventually met the SLE SLICC diagnostic criteria.16 These patients were older at first cytopenia (median age 13 years vs. 5 years; P=0.007) and almost exclusively female (one of 88 males [1%] and ten of 63 females [16%]); P<0.001).\n\nFigure 1. Hematological outcomes. (A) Cumulative incidence of patients achieving a sustained complete remission (CR). Among the 23 patients without sustained CR for autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), four (17%) had achieved sustained CR for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Conversely, among the 32 patients without sustained CR for ITP, 13 (40%) had achieved sustained CR for AIHA. (B) Percentage of patients with a sustained complete remission according to age.\n\nSeven patients (4.6%) met the diagnostic criteria for ALPS after pES onset which prompted targeted genetic analysis.17 Overall, 66 of 151 patients (44%) underwent genetic analyses as previously described.13 Among them, 26 (39%) patients were considered to have a PID (including the seven with ALPS). They carried a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CTLA4 (n=7), TNFRSF6 (germline n=6, somatic n=1), STAT3 (n=5), PIK3CD (n=1), CBL (n=1), and KRAS (somatic n=1) or a homozygous/compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in LRBA (n=3) and RAG1 (n=1). Compared to the 40 other patients, the 26 with a PID had more cIM (2 [range, 1-5] vs. 1 [range, 0-4], P=0.008) and a trend toward more bIM as shown by Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney sum ranks comparison but same medians (1 [range, 0-3] vs. 1 [range, 0-2], P=0.029). There was no statistically significant difference in the median time to ITP CR (4.7 years vs. 8.0 years, P=0.26) and to AIHA CR (5.5 years vs. 5.5 years, P>0.9), the number of second-line treatment received (3 [range, 0-9] vs. 2 [range, 0-6]; P=0.057) and mortality (two of 26 [7.7%] vs. three of 40 [7.5%]; P>0.9).\n\nFigure 2. Immunopathological manifestations. (A) Age at first clinical immunopathological manifestation (cIM) diagnosis and at first cytopenia. Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.42, P<0.0001. There was no difference in the median age at first cIM and at first cytopenia in terms of the number of cIM (data not shown). (B) Cumulative incidence of cIM according to age. Half of the patients had developed a cIM by the age of 13.5 years and a second IM by the age of 27 years. (C) Cumulative incidence of any biological IM (bIM), as well as each category. Half of the patients had at least one bIM diagnosed by 13.2 years of age. The biological workup was not standardized and was made at the clinician\u2019s discretion.

Hypo\u03b3: hypogammaglobulinemia; SLE: systemic lupus erythematosus; ALPS: autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.\n\nTable 2. Most frequent clinical immunopathological manifestations diagnosis.\n\nTreatments\n\nAll except two patients (98.6%) had received at least one first-line treatment course. Second-line treatments (regardless of the hematological and/or extra-hematological indication) were required in 117 of 151 (77%) patients (Online Supplementary Figure 3A). Patients who did not receive any second-line treatment had shorter median follow- up times (10.5 years vs. 12.3 years; P=0.017). The median number of second-line treatments received was two (range, 0\u20139).\n\nThe number of second-line treatments received increased with the time elapsed since first cytopenia without reaching a plateau (Online Supplementary Figure 3B). After a sustained CR for both ITP and AIHA achieved, the number of treatments received had continued to increase: at 5 years after CR of both cytopenias, 67% of patients who achieved CR for both ITP and AIHA had received a new first and/or second-line treatments and 31% had received a new second-line treatment (Online Supplementary Figure S3C).\n\nThe number of second-line treatments received increased with age, particularly after the first decade (Figure 4A). At 10 and 20 years, 47% and 88% of patients had received a second-line treatment, respectively (P<0.001). The number of patients receiving ongoing treatments also increased with age (Figure 4B). At 10 and 20 years, 27% and 69% of patients had received an active second-line treatment, respectively (P<0.001). At the final follow-up, patients with a cIM had received more secondline treatments (median, 3 vs. 1; P<0.0001).\n\nThe most frequently used second-line treatments were rituximab (n=79; 52%), azathioprine (n=55; 36%), splenectomy (n=36; 24%), and mycophenolate (n=29; 19%; Online Supplementary Table S3).\n\nThe number of cIM was associated with a subsequent increase in the number of second-line treatments received (HR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.15\u20131.60; P=0.0002). On the contrary, the number of second-line treatment was not associated to a subsequent increase in the number of cIM in univariate analysis (HR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.98\u20131.22; P=0.11).\n\nInfections\n\nIn total, 53 (35%) patients had severe or recurrent infections (Online Supplementary Table S4). The most frequent were herpes zoster (n=17), sinusitis/otitis media (n=15), pneumopathy (n=12), and bronchiectasis (n=11). Patients with infections had more cIM (median, 2 vs. 1; P<0.0001), a higher incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia (53% vs. 28%; P=0.003), and received more second-line treatments (median 3 vs. 1; P<0.0001). Among the 16 patients with severe infection, nine (63%) were receiving an active treatment at infection time.\n\nFigure 4. Second-line treatments. (A) Total number of second-line treatments received according to the age. (B) Number of second-line treatments ongoing according to age.\n\nSevere/recurrent infections were independently associated with hypogammaglobulinemia (OR 2.4; 95% CI: 1.10\u20135.33; P=0.03) and the number of second-line treatments (OR 1.34; 95% CI: 1.13\u20131.71; P=0.002).\n\nMortality\n\nSixteen of the 151 patients followed for more than 5 years (10.6%) died, and seven other patients died before the fifth year of follow-up (23 deaths in total, 22 with available data). Patient survival at 5, 10, and 15 years after the first cytopenia was 97%, 92%, and 84%, respectively (Figure 5A). Mortality rates in patients with pES were higher than those in patients with cITP or AIHA alone (P<0.0001 for both comparisons).\n\nDeaths occurred regularly throughout the follow-up period (median delay after first cytopenia diagnosis, 8.9 years [range, 0.1\u201324.3 years]) and at a median age of 18.0 years (range, 1.7\u201331.5 years) (Figure 5B). In the majority of these patients, cytopenia was under control at the time of death: 15 (65%) and 19 (83%) patients had CR or partial remission from ITP and AIHA, respectively (Figure 5C). Mortality was linked to the disease, the treatment, or both in eight (36%), two (9%), and twelve (55%) cases, respectively. The most frequent cause of death was infections (n=12 [52%]; Online Supplementary Table S5). Four patients (18%) died of a hemorrhage, and all were less than 13 years of age. The patients who died from a hemorrhage were younger than those who died from an infection (median 10 years vs. 18 years; P=0.03). All of these patients, except for one who died in the first month of a cerebral hemorrhage, had at least one cIM. Eight of the patients (36%) had hypogammaglobulinemia.\n\nFigure 5. Long-term survival. (A) Survival estimate of patients in terms of time from first cytopenia. At 10-year follow- up, survival rates among patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) alone, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) alone and pediatric-onset Evans syndrome (pES) were 100%, 99% and 92%, respectively. (B) Mortality is shown in terms of time from first cytopenia, as well as age. Individual values are shown as dots with medians and interquartile ranges shown as lines. (C) Hematological status at death. CR: complete remission; PR: partial remission; NR: no remission.\n\nThe patients who died had received more second-line treatments than the others in the cohort (median 3 vs. 2; P=0.02), including splenectomy, which was more common in this subgroup (56% vs. 20%; P=0.003). Patients who had received more than two second-line treatments had a three-fold increase in the risk of death compared to those who had received two or less (11 of 65 [16.9%] vs. five of 86 [5.8%], P=0.03). At death, 81% of patients were receiving ongoing second-line treatment. The number of second-line treatments (HR 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1\u20131.6; P=0.004) and severe/recurrent infections (HR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.2\u20139.7; P=0.02) were independently associated with a higher risk of mortality after 5 years of follow-up.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis large follow-up study of pES patients included more than 1,900 patient-years. Over the long term, AIHA and ITP were sustainably controlled in the majority of patients. Conversely, clinical and biological IM increased in frequency and number with increasing patient age, finally affecting almost all adult patients. The number of cIM was associated with a subsequent increase in the number of second-line treatments received. Mortality was high, frequently occurred while cytopenias were in remission, and most deaths concerned AYA. Two characteristics were associated to mortality: severe or recurrent infections and the number of second-line treatments received. Overall, the age-related clinical picture showed similar trends for all patients, shifting from cytopenia to increased IM, a greater treatment burden, and an increased risk of mortality.\n\nIn setting up a nationwide cohort, the CEREVANCE group tried to ensure unbiased patient inclusion in this study. Omitting patients with less than 5 years of followup data limited any bias due to short-term follow-up, which probably accounts for many of the discrepancies between previous studies. Indeed, our median follow-up period was more than twice as long as in previous studies (median 4.8 years [range, 3\u20137 years]).1,3\u20137 However, although the trends reported here are clear, some factors may also influence the estimates. The loss to follow-up mainly concerned AYA and few patients were followed after the age of 20 years. As well, the CEREVANCE group recommends clinical and biological follow-up at least every 6-12 months but local practice or patients\u2019 phenotype (such as the presence of cIM) may have influenced biological testing.\n\nSustained CR was eventually achieved for both types of cytopenia in the vast majority of patients, although this often took many years, especially for ITP (>10 years for one-third of our patients). Because active treatments are used to treat most AYA (notably because of cIM), hematological CR may be drug induced and it is impossible to determine whether an underlying hematological autoimmunity is still present. The higher rate of sustained CR in ITP among patients with pES compared to patients with cITP alone may be due to more patients with pES receiving treatment.18\n\nOne of the most striking findings in this study was the progressive increase in the frequency and number of IM. A range of cIM, affecting almost every organ, were identified and developed independently of cytopenias. These findings clearly show that pES is a marker for a more general tendency toward immunodeficiencies while we cannot exclude a contribution of the second-line treatments received to some IM. The underlying etiology is not completely understood and may vary among patients, with both genetic and environmental factors being important. Consequently, pES may be considered a composite syndrome with several overlapping subgroups of secondary pES. One of these subgroups includes patients with PID. Classically, ALPS has been associated with pES.12 In this study, only 4% of patients were diagnosed with ALPS based on well-defined criteria, despite evocative biological \u201cALPS-like\u201d abnormalities in a larger proportion of patients.17 This observation is consistent with our previous study,13 which showed that more immune-response genes are potentially involved in pES than initially suspected. 13,19\u201321 However, pES rarely comports as a Mendelian disease,1 and some of these variants may be predisposing rather than disease-causing alleles. Even in patients carrying a variant in a monogenic PID gene (e.g., TNFRFS6 or CTLA4),13,22 the altered genes show incomplete penetrance.23,24 We were unable to evaluate the proportion of patients who met common variable immunodeficiency disorders diagnostic criteria,25 as vaccine responses were not evaluable in all cases due to secondline treatments received. A second subgroup includes patients with SLE, although the prevalence of this subgroup is controversial.11,26,27 Our cohort suggests that SLE eventually occurs almost exclusively within the known atrisk population of female adolescents and is frequent in this subgroup, as it developed in seven of 15 (47%) of the females >12 years old.26 Despite its heterogeneity, the course of pES, in terms of age-related changes and trends, was similar for the majority of patients. The spectrum of IM described here is probably influenced by the underlying etiology, and further analyses are needed to understand the determinant of IM. The long-term follow-up of the present study confirms that the subgroup of patients with identified PID had more cIM.13\n\nMost patients required second-line treatments. These treatments reflect local practices and we cannot draw conclusions regarding their efficacy. We were unable to investigate the risk associated to specific treatments given the high heterogeneity in second-line treatment combinations and duration as well as the changes in management practices since the cohort onset in 2004. The rapid initial increase in second-line treatments is partly due to the high rate of early relapse and the current practice of administering steroid-sparing agents to treat pES.28 However, the presence of cytopenia is not the only reason for using these drugs and first- and second-line treatments were also used after CR of both cytopenias. cIM are important in determining the number of second-line treatments used, but bIM may also play a role, particularly in patients with SLE biomarkers, who are frequently given hydroxychloroquine. Nevertheless, second-line treatments are rarely selected based on a single factor. Patients with pES often have bIM and cIM, and the whole clinical picture needs to be assessed before selecting a treatment strategy. As previously reported,13 approximately one-third of patients may carry alterations in genes that are potentially accessible to targeted therapy.29\u201331 Given the high burden of second-line treatments and their association with infections and mortality, the CEREVANCE network has proposed implementing genetic analyses for all patients with pES to limit the use of immunosuppressive and toxic drugs.\n\nComprehensively, the pES clinical picture changes as patients age. From 10 to 20 years of age, cytopenia tends to be controlled but IM are more prevalent, and active second- line treatments are used in more than two-thirds of patients during the pediatric-to-adult transition. Overall, as patients age, the illness becomes more severe and the risk of mortality increases. Both IM and treatment burden contribute to the infection-related mortality peak observed at the end of the second decade. The patients who died had received more second-line treatments, including splenectomy. Because these two parameters are correlated (r=0.60; P<0.0001), the number of deaths was too low to determine whether splenectomy alone was a risk factor of mortality per se or a marker of severity.\n\nIn conclusion, pES must now be considered a complex multi-systemic disease in which cytopenias frequently present fewer challenges than IM and infections in longterm follow-up. Adult patients with pES form a specific subgroup, distinct from older adults with ES.32 Multidisciplinary follow-up of patients with pES is needed and must focus on IM screening, genetic diagnosis, infections prevention, patient-tailored drugs development, and AYA management. Specifically, the infection burden may be reduced by ensuring up-to-date vaccinations, eradicating chronic infections, and using adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis or immunoglobulin replacements. As in several chronic pediatric diseases,33 dedicated child-to-adult transition programs are warranted to improve outcomes in patients with pES.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplementary Appendix\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe list of collaborators is given in the Online Supplementary Appendix.

As its name implies, the diagnosis requires consistent histopathologic findings that typically accompany normal-appearing mucosa. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the presence of distinct endoscopic features is associated with MC. We present a case of MC that highlights the importance of recognizing these macroscopic findings because they can aid in diagnosis and have significant management implications.\n\nTEXT:\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA common cause of chronic secretory diarrhea, microscopic colitis (MC) has an incidence of 21.0 per 100,000 person-years.1 Although the pathogenesis of MC is not entirely elucidated, several medications have been implicated in causing MC, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors.2 The diagnosis of MC, as suggested by its name, is considered histopathologic and occurs in 2 subtypes, lymphocytic and collagenous colitis (CC), both typically presenting with symptoms of diarrhea. Treatment remains similar for all forms of MC.2,3 Therefore, obtaining the diagnosis is paramount. Although there is some guidance regarding the location and number of biopsies that should be obtained to confirm a diagnosis of MC, it most often presents with endoscopically normal-appearing colonic mucosa.4\u20139 However, macroscopic changes are being recognized with increased frequency. We present a rare case of MC that illuminates the importance of recognizing these macroscopic findings because they not only aid in diagnosis but also have significant management implications.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nA 61-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented with 1 month of watery, nonbloody diarrhea. She reported lower quadrant, crampy abdominal pain and a 20-lb weight loss. Her medications included pantoprazole 20 mg, escitalopram 20 mg, celecoxib 200 mg, and ibuprofen, taken 3 times weekly. Her physical examination demonstrated diffuse abdominal tenderness, and the laboratory assessment revealed acute renal insufficiency with a Cr of 3.6 (baseline Cr 1), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 28, and C-reactive protein of 0.4 mg/dl. A complete blood count was notable for a normocytic anemia of 9.3 down from a baseline around 12 and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 68. Infectious stool studies, including Clostridium difficile, stool culture, and ova and parasite testing, were negative. Fecal calprotectin was mildly elevated at 152, and fecal leukocytes were absent. Given progressive abdominal pain, a contrasted abdominal and pelvic computed tomography was performed that revealed diffuse colonic wall thickening and mild mucosal hyperenhancement consistent with pancolitis (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography with diffuse colonic wall thickening and hyperenhancement. The arrow indicates to an area of wall thickening and hyperenhancement signifying pancolitis.\n\nOn colonoscopic examination, erythematous mucosa with congestion was found throughout the entire examined colon along with significant friability characterized by multiple shallow, linear mucosal rents that occurred with minimal insufflation of CO2 (Figure 2). The colonoscope was advanced into the terminal ileum which revealed normal-appearing mucosa. Biopsies were taken separately from the right and left colon for histology, and the remainder of the procedure was uncomplicated. Pathology demonstrated abundant subepithelial collagen deposition in both sets of biopsies consistent with a diagnosis of severe CC (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 2.

The importance of these are that they are high risk endoscopic features and may herald colonic perforation.\n\nFigure 3.

The arrow indicates to an area of collagen deposition.\n\nShe was initiated on 9 mg of budesonide for 1 month, and both celecoxib and pantoprazole were discontinued on discharge. She was counseled to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. At a 1-month follow-up visit, she had complete resolution of her diarrhea. In addition, she denied any other red flag symptoms to include nausea, vomiting, fevers, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia. Her appetite improved, and her weight stabilized. Her budesonide was tapered to 6 mg for 2 weeks followed by 3 mg for 2 weeks. Normalization of her anemia and thrombocytopenia coincided with her clinical improvement. Repeat colonoscopy was not performed.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nDespite the diagnosis of MC classically relying on histologic changes, macroscopic findings are increasingly recognized and present in up to 38.8% of cases of MC.9 These endoscopic findings are typically nonspecific, with the presence of mucosal erythema, edema, and vascular pattern changes, although discrete mucosal tears and ulcerations have been described.5,10,11 These mucosal defects, while rare, have been associated with an increased risk of colonic perforation after colonoscopy and barium enemas.5,10,13 Radiographic studies are also typical, with only a handful of case reports describing nonspecific mucosal nodularity in the sigmoid colon and loss of haustral folds on double-contrast barium enema.12 Association with transmural inflammation is even rarer, and to our knowledge, this is the first report of CC with both radiographic evidence of pancolitis and discrete mucosal ulcerations.\n\nPatients with multiple symptoms beyond diarrhea, including abdominal pain and weight loss, are 3 times more likely to have macroscopic findings on endoscopy.11 Although there is no evidence that macroscopic findings are more common in 1 variant over the other, previous studies have noted a relationship between mucosal ulceration and CC.5,10 In addition, a systematic review by Marlicz et al. found that 17 patients with colonic perforations all had underlying CC, supporting the hypothesis that collagen deposition may reduce colonic compliance, predisposing patients to mucosal tears that may herald colonic perforation.10\n\nAlthough the treatment of MC remains similar in those with and without macroscopic findings, increased awareness and identification of macroscopic findings have the potential to aid in the attainment of an accurate diagnosis while mitigating risk to the patient during a diagnostic colonoscopy. Current American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines recommend either at least 2 random biopsies be taken from the right, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon during colonoscopy or 2 or more random biopsies from transverse, sigmoid, and descending colon on flexible sigmoidoscopy.4 Although colonoscopy with both left-sided and right-sided biopsies remains the preferred approach, previous studies have found similar diagnostic yields between biopsies taken exclusivity from the left side, maintaining a sensitivity of >90%.5\u20137 Where our case is concerned, a complete colonoscopy including intubation of the terminal ileum was performed because inflammatory bowel disease was clinically compatible with the endoscopic findings. In hindsight, however, a flexible sigmoidoscopy with only left-sided biopsies may have been sufficient for a diagnosis in this case, which would have decreased risk to the patient.\n\nThis case highlights an atypical presentation of CC with pancolitis and discrete endoscopic lesions that should prompt endoscopists to alter management. Although future prospective studies are needed to determine whether flexible sigmoidoscopy alone is sufficient for diagnosis of MC, it should be considered with CO2 insufflation or water emersion in those with high-risk endoscopic features. Education surrounding the association of deep mucosal tears and risk of perforation in CC is needed to not only increase recognition of these findings during endoscopy but also underscore the importance of aborting these cases to avoid potential complications when identified.\n\nDISCLOSURES\n\nAuthor contributions: A.

The nonspecificity of symptoms makes the diagnosis sometimes difficult to establish. Prognosis is essentially determined by comorbidities and sensorineural and cognitive sequelae.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 66-year-old Caucasian patient known to have prostatic small-cell neuroendocrine adenocarcinoma under hormonal therapy developed complex partial epileptic seizures associated with rapidly aggravating severe memory impairment. The tripod of autoimmune limbic encephalitis diagnosis was based on the clinical aspect of brain's functional deterioration, electroencephalography aspect, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B anti-receptor antibody positivity. Clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic management as well as evolutionary risks were further analyzed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLimbic encephalitis is an extremely rare presentation of neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes. A better knowledge of this entity would help better manage diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties and reduce the risk of possible sequelae.\n\nTEXT:\nBackground\n\nLimbic encephalitis is a rare autoimmune neurologic syndrome, frequently of paraneoplastic origin, caused by humoral and cellular response against intra- or extracellular specific neural antigens. Multiple antibodies responsible for limbic encephalitis were described and are mostly of paraneoplastic origin.\n\nLimbic encephalitis is often associated with small-cell lung cancer [1], but also other cancers, particularly testicular and ovarian neoplasms.\n\nIt is usually revealed by acute or subacute temporal epileptic seizures, anterograde memory impairments, and neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, irritability, behavioral disorders, delusion, and hallucination).\n\nClinical manifestations, linked to limbic structures deterioration, may not be evident from the early onset of the disorder, making diagnosis very challenging.\n\nNeurologic paraneoplastic syndromes, and to a lesser extent limbic encephalitis, scarcely occur in prostate cancer.\n\nSome cases of limbic encephalitis linked to prostatic tumors were described in association with specific antibodies, such as anti-Hu anti-VGKC, anti-Ma-1, and anti-Ma-2 [2, 3].\n\nType B \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor antibodies (GABAB) were recently described as responsible for the autoimmune encephalitis and, in particular, limbic encephalitis [2].\n\nThe ambiguity of the symptoms and the myriad of antibody panel, as well as the patient\u2019s condition, which is often old aged with an advanced tumor pathology, highlight the diagnostic difficulties and the treatment response\u2019s progression.\n\nThis case has been reported in line with the CARE guidelines [4].\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 66-year-old Caucasian patient has been followed since 2004 for a Gleason score 8 (4\u00a0+\u00a04) prostate adenocarcinoma, initially classified T3N0M0, treated by radiotherapy in association with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogs for a period of 3\u00a0years.\n\nHis family history was relevant for epilepsy in his two sisters.\n\nHormonal treatment was resumed in 2009 for biological recurrence, and he was then put under diethylstilbestrol in 2013.\n\nIn May 2017, he underwent prostate laser photovaporization for severe voiding disorders refractory to medical management. It should be noted that his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) back then was 1.53\u00a0ng/ml.\n\nIn September 2017, the patient presented generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, followed by postictal confusion.\n\nInitial neurological examination, standard laboratory tests, and brain imaging [brain scanner and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] did not show any abnormalities.\n\nTreatment by levetiracetam was then introduced but stopped rapidly.\n\nA few days later, he was hospitalized following the recurrence of the generalized epileptic crises. His wife reported memory and concentration problems that appeared after the first epileptic episode, along with an escalating depressive syndrome.\n\nDuring his hospitalization course, the patient suffered from confusion, phasic disorder with slurred speech, and disorders of simple and complex order comprehension in addition to partial seizures, manifested by loss of contact, chewing, sniffing, clonism, and right gaze deviation.\n\nEpileptic activity with focal onset in left frontotemporal region, secondarily generalized, was documented by the electroencephalogram (EEG) shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1 Example of left temporal seizure with rhythmic discharges of left temporal slow waves and slow spikes\n\nIntravenous administration of clonazepam and levetiracetam allowed clinical improvement, with, however, persistence of left temporal interictal slow peaks on control EEG.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated normal cytology, glycorrhachia, and protein rate. Bacterial culture and herpes virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the CSF were both negative.\n\nFurthermore, supernumerary bands of immunoglobulin were found on the CSF analysis with the absence of Hu, Ri, and Yo neural antibodies. It is noteworthy to mention that GABAB anti-receptor antibodies were positive in the CSF, thus evoking the diagnosis of limbic encephalitis with GABAB receptor antibodies.\n\nThe patient was then hospitalized in the intensive care unit for 2\u00a0weeks secondary to the aggravation of the epileptic seizures, where he was intubated with thiopental sedation after failure of phenytoin and phenobarbital effect.\n\nMethylprednisolone treatment was then started with three boluses of 1\u00a0g, followed by treatment with polyvalent immunoglobulin 2\u00a0g/kg over 5\u00a0days when autoimmune limbic encephalitis diagnosis was confirmed. Antiepileptic treatment had to be escalated gradually by levetiracetam, clobazam, lacosamide, and carbamazepine.\n\nThe course of his hospitalization was then marked with successful extubation after 7\u00a0days along with a few episodes of fluctuating agitation. The control EEG patterns improved gradually with striking evidence of resolved generalized status epilepticus and persistent foci of seizures from right and left temporal starting point. However, some left temporal slow puff of waves persisted without seizure before his discharge from the intensive care unit.\n\nBrain MRI was performed 3\u00a0weeks after the first epileptic seizures showing left hippocampal and parahippocampal hypersignal in T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, with swelling appearance, without contrast enhancement, compatible with the initial diagnosis of limbic encephalitis (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 MRI: left hippocampal and parahippocampal hypersignal, without contrast enhancement\n\nCholine positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed, besides the prostate and iliac ganglionic areas uptake, left temporal brain hypermetabolism corresponding to the electric epileptic focus and the hypersignal observed on MRI. Considering that GABAB anti-receptor antibodies limbic encephalitis is frequently associated with small-cell lung tumors, bronchoscopy with bronchial aspiration were performed, showing no evidence of malignancy.\n\nBack in the neurology department, the patient was calm and better oriented without any sensorimotor deficits or phasic disorders. However, mild ataxia and especially massive anterograde memory disorders persisted. Neuropsychological assessment revealed verbal and visual anterograde memory disorders as well as psychomotor fatigue and concentration difficulties.\n\nHospitalization was complicated with left lower limb deep vein thrombosis treated by curative anticoagulation.\n\nImmunotherapy was changed to immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nThe patient received one course of cyclophosphamide of 1\u00a0g and two courses of rituximab of 375\u00a0mg/m2.\n\nNo prolongation of cyclophosphamide treatment was done owing to persistent neutropenia and lymphopenia. Rituximab was not renewed 6\u00a0months later as treatment with chemotherapy was established.\n\nControl brain MRI showed stable left hippocampal and parahippocampal T2 and FLAIR hypersignal, without contrast enhancement.\n\nThe patient then remained neurologically stable for 2\u00a0years, with visual anterograde and immediate memory improvement. Nevertheless, verbal anterograde memory was deficient with autobiographical lacunar amnesia regarding the 2\u00a0years that preceded the disorder.\n\nEpileptic seizures receded with normalization of the subsequent control EEG patterns and tapering of antiepileptic treatment.\n\nConcerning the prostate cancer follow-up, diethylstilbestrol was stopped and was replaced by degarelix before tumor progression on imaging. It should be recalled that the PSA level at the beginning of the neurological events was 0.16\u00a0ng/ml, then increased to 1.1\u00a0ng/ml, and then dropped back to 0.68\u00a0ng/ml 6\u00a0months after degarelix was introduced.\n\nFollowing voiding urinary symptoms complaints, several investigations were conducted, including abdominopelvic ultrasound showing a bilateral ureteral and pyelocalyceal dilatation with a postvoid residual of urine of 300\u00a0cc with laboratory data indicating the start of kidney injury with creatinine level of 140\u2013150\u00a0\u00b5mol/l serum.\n\nFlexible cystoscopy revealed an obstructive prostate. Consequently, prostate endoscopic bipolar resection was performed.\n\nHistological examination found a poorly differentiated carcinomatous proliferation, with significant eosinophilic necrosis. Carcinomatous cells were observed in ranges and sheets of average size, presenting hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular outlines and quite abundant cytoplasm (Fig. 3).Fig. 3 Microscopic histological examination; hematoxylin\u2013eosin coloration: poorly differentiated carcinomatous proliferation, with significant necrotic eosinophilic change\n\nImmunohistochemical examination showed positivity for neuroendocrine markers (CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A), and absence of expression of CK7 and PSA (Fig. 4). Ki67 proliferation index was high, marking 100% of tumor cells (Fig. 5).Fig. 4 Immunohistochemical findings: positivity for neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin A)\n\nFig. 5 Immunohistochemical findings: High Ki67 proliferation index, marking 100% of tumor cells\n\nA multidisciplinary discussion was held, and decision was made to start chemotherapy of which he initially received six courses of cisplatin with etoposide after discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatment. PSA level after the last course\u00a0was 0.21\u00a0ng/ml.\n\nFollow-up PET scan showed the presence of subdiaphragmatic ganglia; accordingly, docetaxel as a second-line treatment was started with an unfavorable response after six courses evidenced by bilateral palpable indurated inguinal adenopathies and hepatic metastatic nodules on choline PET scan.\n\nHence, a third-line chemotherapy by doxorubicin associated with cyclophosphamide was started with progression of hepatic nodules on follow-up PET scan after three cycles.\n\nAs such, cabazitaxel as a last chemotherapy was commenced with initial favorable response after three courses. Subsequently, PET scan findings deteriorated, showing isotopic, ganglionic, bone, hepatic, and cerebral progression.\n\nConsidering the aggressive disease profile, it was decided to stop any further treatment and to confine the patient to palliative care.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNeurologic paraneoplastic syndromes are rarely associated with prostatic tumors.\n\nClinical aspects are variable. Beside limbic encephalitis, observations of cerebellar degenerations, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion syndrome, or peripheral neuropathy were reported in a few case series [5].\n\nForms related to GABA antineuronal antibodies represent 5% of autoimmune encephalitis.\n\nThe development of immunological tests for serodiagnosis and antibody typing allowed the classification of the previously considered idiopathic or viral encephalitis, as autoimmune encephalitis, with well-defined immunological profiles [6].\n\nParaneoplastic encephalitis poses diagnostic and etiological problems. Clinically, symptom onset is often acute or subacute. The most frequently revealing sign is seizure.\n\nDisorientation, delirium, aphasia, and memory disorders may be observed with variable degrees of severity.\n\nDiffuse cerebral damage, cerebellar ataxia, and encephalomyelitis can worsen initial presentation in about 40% of cases [7].\n\nParaneoplastic encephalitis reveals primitive tumor in about 60% of the cases, all sites combined. The most frequently reported tumors are small-cell lung tumors [1].\n\nDifferential diagnosis is sometimes difficult to establish, given clinical resemblance with brain metastases and infectious encephalitis [8].\n\nParaclinical diagnosis is based on three essential elements: brain MRI, electroencephalogram patterns, and antineural antibody assays.\n\nBrain MRI is more sensitive than scanning, as FLAIR sequences ensure higher detection of lesions. It concerns mainly temporal lobe hypersignal in T2 and FLAIR sequences [9]. If MRI is normal, PET scan can be useful. Temporal hypermetabolism can be explained by convulsions and acute inflammation [8].\n\nElectrical modifications in temporal region are observed in half of the cases. EEG is particularly useful during follow-up [8].\n\nCSF is abnormal in 80% of cases, showing pleocytosis, hyperproteinorachia, and possibly intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis [8]. The rate of blood or cerebrospinal fluid antibodies is not correlated with clinical and evolutive profile [2].\n\nThe treatment should be targeted against both the encephalitis and the primitive tumor. The initial management consists essentially of antiepileptic treatment, parenteral corticotherapy, immunotherapy, and eventually plasmapheresis.\n\nIn the rare reported cases complicating prostate cancer, evolution was favorable in one case only with clinical and radiological stabilization following total prostatectomy for a localized cancer [10].\n\nThe first description of limbic encephalitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome complicating a primitive prostatic small-cell carcinoma was published by Stern in 1999 [11]. Symptoms at initial presentation included fever, lower urinary tract symptoms, and truncal ataxia in a 76-year-old patient. Evolution was rapidly unfavorable. Histological diagnosis was confirmed after autopsy.\n\nRegarding GABA receptors, they were first described recently by Lancaster et\u00a0al. in 2010 [9]. Alberti reports almost constant aberrant production of GABA in invasive neuroendocrine tumors [12]. The type of antibodies associated with neurological disorders determines in part the treatment efficiency. The forms with neuronal antibodies directed against intracellular antigens are less likely to evolve favorably. Antibodies acting on surface antigens, such as GABA receptor, have better prognosis under immunotherapy [13].\n\nLin et\u00a0al. reported 28 cases of autoimmune encephalitis by GABAB receptor antibodies [14].\n\nPrognosis of paraneoplastic forms is more unfavorable. Mortality predictive factors are advanced age, paraneoplastic character, occurrence of septic complications, and deep vein thrombosis. Major causes of mortality in intensive care are tumor progression, severe pneumonia, epileptic seizure, and septic shock.\n\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of primitive tumor improve clinical course and prognosis.\n\nThe case we report is, to our knowledge, the first to be described with antineural antibodies against GABAB receptor associated with prostate neuroendocrine tumor. The initial management of encephalitis required intensive care.\n\nCorticotherapy treatment was relayed by immunoglobulin course first, then immunotherapy by rituximab and immunosuppressive treatment by cyclophosphamide.\n\nBesides the initial neurological disorders, we particularly note the occurrence of deep venous thrombosis of the lower limb as an element of utmost gravity.\n\nDespite the absence of epileptic seizure recurrence, neurocognitive sequelae and memory disorders persisted, particularly anterograde and autobiographical.\n\nOn the carcinological level and given the metabolic progression, diethylstilbestrol was replaced by degarelix. The nonelevation of PSA could be explained by the presence of neuroendocrine component on prostate resection specimen.\n\nIn fact, prostate neuroendocrine tumors, well known for their aggressiveness, are generally hormone-resistant. Tumor progression following the initiation of different chemotherapy lines, particularly seen on metabolic imaging, justified the decision of palliative care.\n\nConclusion\n\nParaneoplastic encephalitis remains exceptionally underreported in prostate cancer. Diagnostic difficulty is related to the nonspecificity of initial symptoms, and the etiological investigation of the primitive tumor. Comorbidities, tumor evolution, and specific complications in intensive care affect prognosis. A better knowledge of physiopathological mechanisms with precise immunological typing permits adjustment of therapeutic strategies and improves evolution. The oncological management should be associated with initial measures. The best profiles are associated with curative management, when plausible.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nNot available in this section.\n\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\n\nWS, OK, and SB performed the surgery and conceived and designed the study.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nThe Diagnosis Is in the Smear: A Case and Review of Spur Cell Anemia in Cirrhosis.\n\nABSTRACT:\nThe etiology of anemia in liver cirrhosis is multifactorial; one less recognized cause is hemolytic anemia due to spur cells, known as spur cell anemia. We present the case of a 57-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with symptomatic macrocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4\u2009g/dL and signs of decompensated liver disease. Notably, she had no signs of overt bleeding. Further workup was consistent with hemolysis, with peripheral smear demonstrating spur cells. The patient was treated with both steroids and IVIG, although she eventually expired. The characteristic morphology of spur cells is due to alteration of the lipid composition of the erythrocyte membrane, changing its shape and leading to splenic sequestration and destruction. Characteristic of this disorder is an increased ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid on the membrane, as well as low levels of apolipoproteins and low- and high-density lipoproteins. The presence of spur cells is an indicator of poor prognosis and high risk of mortality. Currently, the only definitive cure is liver transplantation. There is a paucity of literature on the prevalence of this phenomenon and even less about treatment. This case highlights the importance of recognition of spur cell anemia as a cause of anemia in cirrhosis as well as the importance of the peripheral smear in the diagnostic workup. Early recognition can lead to avoidance of unnecessary procedures. Further research is needed to elucidate the true prevalence of spur cell anemia and examine further treatment options.\n\nTEXT:\n1. Introduction\n\nThe systemic sequelae of liver cirrhosis are vast and consist of hematological abnormalities, including anemia. The etiology of anemia in cirrhotic patients is multifactorial and can be secondary to red blood cell destruction by splenic sequestration and hypersplenism, bone marrow suppression, vitamin deficiencies, and occult or chronic bleeding from varices or gastropathy [1]. Less commonly generated in the differential, although unmistakable on peripheral smear, is that of spur cell anemia (SCA) which induces a hemolytic anemia in patients with liver disease. SCA is associated with high mortality and treatment options are limited. Here, we report a case of SCA in the setting of alcoholic liver cirrhosis.\n\n2. Case Report\n\nWe present the case of a 57-year-old Hispanic woman with a past medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis (MELD-Na 30 on admission, Child-Pugh Class C) complicated by Grade I esophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy, as well as recently diagnosed stage I colorectal adenocarcinoma (treatment na\u00efve), who presented to the hospital with a one-week history of fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness. On admission, the patient was noted to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of 89/48, afebrile with a temperature of 98.4 \u00b0F, and tachycardic with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Physical exam was notable for appearance of weakness, although the patient was awake, alert, and oriented, with scleral icterus, jaundice, splenomegaly, ascites, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory exams in the initial days of presentation are noted in Table 1 and are significant for macrocytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 7.4\u2009g/dL and a mean corpuscular volume of 109.4\u2009fL. Studies were consistent with hemolysis, with an elevated LDH of 263 U/L, indirect hyperbilirubinemia of 9.2\u2009mg/dL, undetectable haptoglobin (<10\u2009mg/dL), and elevated reticulocyte count of 16.1% (Table 1). Her macrocytosis was most likely secondary to reticulocytosis due to hemolysis, although workup of vitamin deficiencies was initiated, demonstrating normal folate levels and elevated vitamin B12 levels, likely in the setting of severe liver disease [2, 3]. Peripheral smear demonstrated mostly acanthocytes (spur cells), spherocytes, rare schistocytes, target cells, and few burr cells (Figure 1). The patient was resuscitated with packed red blood cells and fluids and briefly placed on vasopressors. Notably, the patient had no clinical evidence of upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. For this reason, the patient did not undergo endoscopy or colonoscopy during her admission.\n\nOn further workup of her hemolytic anemia, the patient was tested for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria with FLAER, which was negative, as was direct Coombs testing. Of note, three months prior to this presentation, during a previous admission, the patient had a direct Coombs test that was positive for IgG antibody; elution testing revealed a warm autoantibody. It was speculated that perhaps the patient had a low level of antibodies, not detectable during this admission, and that she perhaps had warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA). However, during her previous admission, when she tested positive, she had also received a blood transfusion at that time which could have contributed to a false positive. Additional workup included CT of the abdomen and pelvis to assess for lymphadenopathy given the association of lymphoproliferative disorders and WAIHA, which was negative for lymphadenopathy although remarkable for splenomegaly of 14.4\u2009cm. She was initially treated for WAIHA with steroids at 1\u2009mg/kg for three days, increased to 1.5\u2009mg/kg for five days with no clinical response in terms of her hemolysis panel; therefore, a steroid taper was started. Due to the refractory nature, she was treated with IVIG 1\u2009mg/kg for two days. The new leading diagnosis was SCA because of findings on peripheral smear and lack of response to steroid therapy. Lipid levels, including apolipoprotein levels, were obtained, given the association with SCA and defects in lipid metabolism, and were notable for decreased total cholesterol, LDL, and apolipoproteins AI and B (Table 2). After receiving IVIG, her hemolysis panel was unchanged, except for the indirect bilirubin which continued to worsen (Table 3). Unfortunately, several days later, the patient continued to decompensate and expired from acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to pneumonia.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nAcanthocytes, or spur cells, consist of characteristic spicules seen on peripheral smear. The mechanism is thought to be alteration of lipid metabolism on the erythrocyte membrane, leading to the characteristic morphology that has a propensity for hemolysis. As delineated previously, the etiologies of anemia in liver disease are vast. Portal hypertension can lead to enlargement of the spleen (as seen in this patient), causing sequestration and destruction of red and white blood cells as well as platelets. Another important consideration is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which has a number of causes, including cirrhosis and malignancy, and should be on the differential in any patient with elevation of coagulation tests and thrombocytopenia. Although this patient's normal fibrinogen, rare schistocytes on smear, and chronically elevated coagulation studies do not wholly support acute DIC, the chronic form is an important concern and could exacerbate an occult bleed from varices or gastropathy, leading to anemia. Specifically, the differential of hemolytic anemia in alcoholics with liver disease, in addition to SCA, includes a pathology known as Zieve syndrome, a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and transient hyperlipidemia. The pathophysiology is attributed to alcohol toxicity to the erythrocyte membranes, leading to hemolysis and release of lipid into the circulation [4]; spur cells are usually not seen on peripheral smear [5]. Zieve syndrome is seen in milder liver disease, and the prognosis is markedly different: cessation of alcohol use usually resolves the anemia and other sequelae.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in the metabolism and homeostasis of lipids, and thus, liver dysfunction has modification of lipid homeostasis as a known side effect. In alcoholic cirrhosis, fat accumulation in the liver contributes to this dysfunction [6]. It has been observed that in liver disease, the erythrocyte membrane has an increased ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid [7, 8]. This is in part due to the fact that in the setting of liver disease, the activity of serum lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, an enzyme which converts free cholesterol into cholesterol ester, is decreased, and consequently, the free cholesterol is elevated. This cholesterol accumulation increases erythrocyte surface area, altering its shape [7, 9], leading to splenic sequestration and subsequent destruction [10].\n\nOther lipid profile abnormalities have been observed in liver disease. For example, Duhamel et al. noted that significantly low levels of apolipoprotein A (apoA)-II, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) III, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) appeared characteristic of alcoholic cirrhotics with spur cells, with a trend toward lower apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels [11]. Although we do not have a baseline apoB for our patient, her level was on the low end of normal (40\u2009mg/dL) when measured during admission. Cicognani et al. demonstrated an inverse relationship between levels of LDL, HDL, and total serum cholesterol level with severity of liver disease [12]. Notably, decreased levels of Apo-AI, as seen in our patient, seem to be a marker of fibrosis in alcoholic patients, potentially secondary to binding to fibronectin [6]. Indeed, studies have demonstrated a worsening lipid profile with increasing severity of liver disease [13, 14]. It is worth noting tht five months prior to presentation, the patient had a MELD-Na of 25 and was Child-Pugh Class B (compared to MELD-Na 30 with Child-Pugh Class C on presentation) with the lipid panel as seen in Table 2, with a trend toward decreasing total cholesterol and LDL (albeit with an increase in HDL). The presence of spur cell anemia has been associated with poor prognosis in cirrhotic patients; one study reported a median survival of 1.9\u2009months in patients with >5% spur cells [15]. Similarly, a study by Vassiliadis et al. observed that presence of >5% spur cells correlated with lower 3-month survival rates [5].\n\nOther sequelae of SCA include a prolonged INR. This elevation is in part secondary to the diminished synthesis of coagulation factors seen in liver disease and often concomitant vitamin K deficiency that is seen with malnutrition and alcoholism, although in the setting of SCA, it is also postulated to be due to the alteration of the phospholipid components of thromboplastin reagents [5, 16]. In addition, it has been reported that platelets also have alteration of membrane lipids, warping the meshwork used in clot formation [16]. However, the additional cholesterol on platelet membranes appears to induce platelet aggregation [17]. Sundaram et al. hypothesized that this hypercoagulable state may offset the bleeding diathesis that would otherwise be expected in the setting of a pronounced coagulopathy. Both the Child-Pugh and MELD scores, used as an estimation of cirrhosis severity and for liver transplant allocation, respectively, utilize the INR in their calculation. Given the association of SCA with severe liver disease, the effect of the pathologic mechanisms of SCA on the already present coagulopathy may be serendipitous, as this would increase the MELD score and the likelihood for a transplant.\n\nThere is a paucity of literature on the true prevalence of spur cell anemia, and even less so on treatment modalities. The only definitive cure for spur cell anemia is liver transplant, and complete reversal of anemia has been reported after transplantation [18]. Unfortunately, our patient was not a candidate for liver transplant given her active workup for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Plasmapheresis has historically been attempted. One study comparing lipid profiles before and after plasmapheresis demonstrated an increase in concentrations of total cholesterol, phospholipids, and apo-AI after treatment, although low levels of lipoprotein (a), LDL, and apo-AII persisted. Reticulocyte counts and hemoglobin levels were also noted to improve, although other markers of hemolysis were constant [19]. A case of spur cell anemia has been reported with successful improvement of hemolysis panel, decrease in number of spur cells, and decrease in the amount of free cholesterol in the blood with combination therapy of flunarizine, pentoxifylline, and cholestyramine, with remission achieved for almost a year with cholestyramine alone [20].\n\nThis case serves as a review of spur cell anemia as a cause of hemolytic anemia in advanced cirrhosis and highlights the importance of the peripheral smear in its diagnosis. Clinician awareness of the differential of hemolytic anemia in alcoholic liver disease should prompt ordering of a lipid profile, which is otherwise not normally ordered in an anemic cirrhotic patient. Early recognition could not only lead to early treatment but also prevent unnecessary procedures, namely, an elaborate endoscopic search for a gastrointestinal bleed. In addition, this report details the lack of efficacy of steroids and IVIG in treating this form of hemolytic anemia. Further research is needed to define treatment options and more accurately delineate the true prevalence of this etiology of anemia.\n\nData Availability\n\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\nFigure 1 Peripheral smear using 100x objective lens demonstrating numerous acanthocytes (spur cells), spherocytes, target cells, and occasional burr cells.

To what degree psoriasis itself through chronic immune stimulation, or the immunosuppressive medications used for its treatment or comorbidities (obesity, diabetes mellitus, etc), or lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, diet, etc) may play a role in the onset of MF is not yet clear. Psoriasis and Mycosis Fungoides (MF), the most common variant of CTCL, represent two distinct entities sharing common pathogenetic mechanisms and a wide spectrum of common clinical features associated with the abnormal activation of T-cells. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between MF and psoriasis by presenting two cases with clinical and histopathologic features of both psoriasis and MF with a particular emphasis on the time of presentation of both disorders, the use of previous immunosuppressive drugs as well as the therapeutic management of patients. Biopsy of the cutaneous lesions before the introduction of biologics should be incorporated in clinical practice. Biopsy of the cutaneous lesion should also be performed in the case of appearance of psoriasiform lesions during biologic treatment for autoimmune disorders because this may represent an indolent form of MF. Psoriatic patients with poor or no-response to treatment should be examined thoroughly for MF using immunochemistry and, if necessary, molecular biology techniques. In concomitant MF and psoriasis, combination treatment may be beneficial for both entities. Finally, a large multicentric registry of MF patients who were treated for benign dermatoses (i.e. eczema, psoriasis) with classic immunosuppressive drugs and/or biologics is needed to collect data and further clarify the enigmatic relationship between psoriasis, MF and immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1 Introduction\n\nEarly stage mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common type of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL), can mimic frequent and benign dermatoses such as eczema or psoriasis, delaying the diagnosis by several years [1]. MF has been characterized as a \u201cdermatological masquerader\u201d due to its multiple clinical variants, such as folliculotropic, poikilodermatous, hypopigmented, capillaritis-like, verrucous/hyperkeratotic, psoriasiform, ichthyosiform and bullous. In its erythrodermic form, the differential diagnosis between eczema or psoriasis and MF is virtually impossible based on clinical appearance [1,2].\n\nPsoriasis is one of the commonest chronic dermatoses, with approximately 2\u20133% of subjects affected worldwide, presenting with erythematous scaly plaques that can be clinically indistinguishable from psoriasiform MF [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. Psoriasis, a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder, has been linked to a moderately higher risk of certain malignancies, particularly keratinocyte, lung, urinary/bladder, oropharynx/larynx, hepatic and colorectal cancers as well as lymphomas [2,13,14].\n\nDuring the last century, the occurrence of lymphoma in autoimmune disorders including psoriasis has been extensively investigated. More specifically, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the overall incidence of lymphoma is approximately twice than that in the general population [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. A very recent collaborative analysis of 12 European registries has shown that although the subtype of lymphoma distribution differed between RA and the general population, there were no differences in the distribution of lymphoma subtypes in patients with RA treated with Tumor Necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors compared with bio-na\u00efve patients [22]. The association between psoriasis and lymphoma has also been discussed [2,14,23,24]. Two large population-based studies have shown that the incidence rates for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CTCL were higher among patients with psoriasis compared with the general population [23,24]. A recent meta-analysis has shown that, compared to controls, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis presented a slightly elevated risk for developing lymphohematopoietic cancer (LHC), ranging from 1.7-fold for Hodgkin lymphoma, 1.3-fold for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma and leukemia to 6-fold for CTLC/MF [14].\n\nOn the other hand, based on case series and case reports [25,26], there have been cases of MF misdiagnosed as psoriasis. In these cases, it is very difficult to clarify: 1) whether patients also presented psoriasis that evolved to MF, and 2) what could be the potential link between MF and the use of immunosuppressive drugs, such as TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors in psoriasis. However, it is worth noting that: 1) diagnosis of psoriasis is not supported by pathology most of the time and 2) histologic findings of lesions in early MF may be misinterpreted as psoriasis. Another intriguing point is the chronic sequence of the MF and psoriasis coexistence, and its connection with the use of biologics such as TNF-inhibitors in psoriasis. More specifically, regarding the time of MF appearance, it seems that MF appears frequently later in the course of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder such as psoriasis and after the use of immunosuppressive drugs or biologics [[25], [26], [27], [28]]. However, in a cohort of 177 patients with MF, MF preceded psoriasis diagnosis in 58.1% of cases, while 25.6% of psoriasis diagnoses were supported by pathology suggesting that the purported association between those two disorders is less likely due to misclassification bias [27].\n\nThe aim of this study is to explore the relationship of MF and psoriasis by presenting two cases with clinical and histopathologic features of both psoriasis and MF with a particular emphasis on the time of presentation of both disorders, the use of previous drugs as well as the therapeutic management of patients.\n\n2 Case reports\n\n2.1 First case\n\nA 65-year-old Caucasian male patient with a history of refractory psoriasis to many previous systemic treatments, including several biologics had been hospitalized in our Dermatology Department, being erythrodermic upon admission (Body Surface Area/BSA: 100%) with a longstanding exfoliative dermatitis (Fig. 1A and B). At the age of 43, he presented with xeroderma of the shins and 7 years later with moderate generalized xerosis of his body without erythema. The skin biopsy revealed ichthyosis. After 4 years, he reported a progressive loss of scalp hair leading to alopecia totalis, and 8 years later a rapidly spreading macular erythroderma with scattered thicker plaques and intense pruritus. Histology of the latter revealed psoriasis. Since then, the patient has undergone a series of unsuccessful treatments depicted in Table 1.Fig. 1 A & B. The patient presented with longstanding exfoliative dermatitis. No nail psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis were observed. C. H&Ex40. Clear epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes and one Pautrier's microabscess are observed. D. Psoriasiform appearance of the patient's lesions, one month after initiation of interferon-alpha-2b. E. H&E x40. Biopsy of a lesion of the shoulder revealed both epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes, as well as Munro's microabscesses, acanthosis, hyper- and parakeratosis and effacement of the granular layer, elements of both MF and psoriasis within the same lesion. F. Pustular eruption on the patient's scalp after 1.5 month of treatment with interferon-alpha-2b.\n\nG. Pustular lesion of the scalp revealed regular acanthosis, effacement of the granular layer, intense neutrophilic infiltrate and presence of Munro's microabscesses. No features of MF were observed.\n\nFig. 1\n\nTable 1 Treatment modalities received by the first patient for psoriasis and mycosis fungoides.\n\nTable 1SERIES OF TREATMENT\tMEDICATION\tTREATMENT DURATION\tINITIAL BSA (%)\tBEST RESPONSE (% BSA)\t%BSA AT THE END OF TREATMENT\t\nPATIENT\u2019S TREATMENT FOR PSORIASIS\t\n1\tAcitretin 35\u00a0mg qd\t3 months\t100\t50\t100\t\n2\tAdalimumab 40\u00a0mg q2w\u00a0+\u00a0MTX 7.5\u00a0mg qw\t4 months\t100\t0\t100\t\n3\tAcitretin 25\u00a0mg qd\t7 months\t100\t60\t100\t\n4\tSecukinumab 300\u00a0mg q4w\t8 months\t100\t70\t80\t\n5\tAdalimumab 40\u00a0mg q2w\t3 months\t80\t70\t80\t\n6\tUstekinumab 90\u00a0mg\tOnce\t80\t80\t100\t\nPATIENT\u2019S TREATMENT FOR MF\t\n7\tBexarotene 300\u00a0mg qd\t6 months\t100\t42\t97\t\n8\tInterferon a-2b 3MIU tiw\t6 weeks\t97\t35\t85\t\n9\tInterferon a-2b 3MIU tiw\u00a0+\u00a0MTX 10\u00a0mg qw\t2 weeks\t85\t75\t75\t\nPATIENT\u2019S TREATMENT FOR MF AND PSORIASIS\t\n10\tMTX 20\u00a0mg qw\t6 weeks\t75\t68\t73\t\n11\tAcitretin 30\u00a0mg qd\t3 weeks\t73\t70\t70\t\n12\tBexarotene 300\u00a0mg qd\u00a0+\u00a0acitretin 25\u00a0mg qd\t2 months\t70\t35\t35\t\nAbbreviations: BSA: Body Surface Area; MF: mycosis fungoides; MTX: methotrexate.\n\nA new skin biopsy during his hospitalization in our clinic was diagnostic of folliculotropic MF (Fig. 1C). CT scans of neck, chest, upper and lower abdomen were negative for enlarged lymph nodes and visceral involvement. The stage of MF was T4N0M0B0 (IIIA). Treatment for MF was initiated (Table 1). After 1 month of treatment with interferon monotherapy, lesions gave the clinical impression of psoriasis and histology from his posterior trunk and his right shoulder confirmed a limited infiltration by atypical cells diagnostic of MF, but the specimen from the shoulder demonstrated elements of both MF and psoriasis (Fig. 1D and E).\n\nLow dose methotrexate (10\u00a0mg q.w. per os) was added to interferon. Two weeks later, the patient initially showed slight improvement of his erythroderma (from 85% BSA to 75% BSA), but in a follow-up visit, he presented with pustular psoriasis of the scalp. New skin biopsies, one from the back and one from a pustule of the scalp (Fig. 1F and G), were diagnostic of MF and psoriasis respectively. The patient was consequently treated with a combination treatment targeting both MF and psoriasis (Table 1), and till today he has remained in partial remission.\n\n2.2 Second case\n\nA 55-year-old male Caucasian patient with a 4-year history of psoriasis presented with erythematous scaly plaques and recent diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid (BP) under remission, was hospitalized in the Dermatology Department with a newly appearing tumor on the right side of his chin. The latter appeared after 2 months of immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine for BP (Fig. 2A and B).Fig. 2 A & B. Psoriasiform lesions on the lower limbs with thick white scale and a tumor with erosions on the right chin, appearing 2 months after cyclosporine therapy. C. Histopathology of a psoriasiform plaque of the back revealed epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes, along with psoriasis features: regular acanthosis, elongation of the rete ridges, effacement of the granular layer, hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. D. Psoriasiform plaque on the left sole of the patient, appearing 18 months after TSEB therapy, confirmed as MF histologically.\n\nFig. 2\n\nHistology from the tumor of the chin and two specimens from psoriasiform plaques from his back and thigh respectively revealed MF and MF plaques with psoriasiform characteristics. (Fig. 2C). CT imaging, peripheral blood smear examination and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry were unremarkable. The MF stage was T3N0M0B0 (stage IIb).\n\nThe patient underwent low dose Total Skin Electron Beam (TSEB) therapy (12\u00a0Gy) with complete response and remained completely clear for 18 months, after which he presented with a 1.5\u00a0cm psoriasiform plaque on his left sole (Fig. 2D), which was treated with electron beam therapy.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nPsoriasis and MF share common pathogenetic features associated with the abnormal function of T-cells although the precise mechanism of abnormal T-cell stimulation and migration is still under investigation. Both psoriasis and early MF exhibit a Th1 phenotype while recent data support a prevailing role of Th17 immune response in psoriasis and IL17 expression in CTCL lesions induced by the JAK3/STAT3 signaling intracellular pathway [26,28]. Based on our cases, we underscore the following key points: 1) the coexistence of MF and psoriasis; 2) the clinical resemblance of psoriasiform MF to plaque psoriasis leading to difficulties in the differential diagnosis; and 3) the potential evolution from a cutaneous inflammatory disorder such as psoriasis to a malignant neoplastic disease such as MF after immunosuppressive treatment or due to the chronic immune stimulation [14,29,30] induced by psoriasis.\n\nMF and psoriasis are two distinct skin disorders that, in the vast majority of cases, present as separate entities, whereas in some cases they may coexist, or MF may present after psoriasis treatment, or MF may resemble psoriasis. Interestingly, there have been reports of CTCL presenting in patients with severe atopic eczema [31]; however, this association has not been confirmed in a case-control study [32]. Despite differences in their etiology, psoriasis and MF may share some common clinical, immunologic and histopathologic characteristics that render their distinction difficult as observed in the presented case reports. In the vast majority of cases with concomitant MF and psoriasis, the onset of psoriasis precedes the onset of MF [26].\n\nIn case #1, it is evident that the patient has suffered from MF since the alopecia appearance, with a psoriatic component. To what degree anti-TNF agents and other biologics contributed to the etiopathogenesis of MF is a matter of debate. There has been a delay in the diagnosis of MF (approximately 20 years). Intriguingly, the non-response of psoriasis to practically all biologics that he had received raised the suspicion of MF, which turned out to have histologic features of psoriasis. Case #2 was a typical case of psoriasis. The patient had erythematous, sharply defined scaly plaques, on both non-sun and sun-exposed areas of his skin. A common feature of both cases is the appearance of histologically confirmed MF lesions after receiving immunosuppressive therapy. In case #2, while the BP subsided rapidly (within 4 weeks), it seems that cyclosporine may have played a certain role in the progression of plaque stage to tumor stage MF.\n\nPsoriasiform MF is not a common variant of MF; nevertheless, it has been demonstrated in case reports [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. It can mimic psoriasis both clinically and histologically. MF can even present as pustulosis of the palms and soles [24,38]. Apart from the characteristic features of MF, histologic features of psoriasis, such as elongation of the rete ridges with regular acanthosis, hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis, thinning, or total effacement of the granular layer and Munro microabscesses are present. Overall, it appears reasonable that misclassification between the two disease entities, psoriasis and MF, could explain the strong associations between psoriasis and CTLC observed in the literature [2].\n\nThe relationship between psoriasis and LHC has been controversial due to the limitations of the epidemiologic studies conducted in the USA and Europe, including among others their retrospective design, the modest sample size, the diagnosis misclassification bias and the evaluation of psoriasis severity [2]. The relative risks associating psoriasis with LHC may also reflect the co-risk parameters of metabolic associated disorders, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking and alcohol consumption [2,5,6,8,10,39,40]. We cannot exclude that the increased likelihood of LHC in psoriasis patients may be explained by genetic factors, unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, diet, etc), comorbidities such as obesity and DM, chronic use of immunosuppressant drugs and the chronic immune/inflammatory state with persistent stimulation of lymphocytes that characterizes chronic psoriasis [2,6]. Indeed, chronic psoriatic skin inflammation is related with sustained skin T-cell activation, elevating the risk of accumulating genetic mutations and ultimately lymphomagenesis [14]. As T cells are the overactivated lymphocytes in psoriasis, a higher occurrence of T lymphoma, such as CTCL, is expected in psoriasis. Besides, psoriasis and CTLC may share common genetic background that enhance tumor cell proliferation and survival [14]. Moreover, obesity, which represents the most common comorbidity in psoriasis, is characterized by the overgrowth and dysfunctionality of the adipose tissue resulting in substantial alterations in its cellular composition as well as in the dysregulation of proinflammatory adipocytokines that synergically promote chronic subclinical inflammation, insulin resistance, microenvironmental and cellular perturbations and tumor transformation in pre-existing clones [[41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]].\n\nWhether the chronic use of selected immunomodulatory drugs may influence the risk of LHC/CTCL is a matter of debate. Immunosuppressive agents may elicit a lack of immune surveillance facilitating thereby the development of CTCL. Immunosuppression elicited by cyclosporine, methotrexate with photochemotherapy (PUVA), and TNF-inhibitors or other biologics could speed up the onset and evolution of MF in psoriatic patients [2]. The chronic use of high dose of cyclosporine has been linked to an elevated risk of lymphoma in patients with psoriasis [58]. Whilst acitretin may be protective against LHC, the use of methotrexate has shown mixed results [14,59,60]. The mechanisms by which anti-TNF\u03b1 agents either trigger or promote progression of cutaneous lymphoma have not yet been elucidated. Anti-TNF\u03b1 agents may negatively affect the stimulation and function of NK cells by impairing the immunosurveillance against B-cell lymphoma [61]. In a recent meta-analysis, patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with anti-TNF\u03b1 agents presented a moderate increased risk of lymphoma while in the setting of psoriasis patients, their chronic use presented comparable malignancy risk with that of surveillance and epidemiologic registries [14,[62], [63], [64], [65]]. However, a recent multicenter retrospective study of 22 patients (20 patients with CTCL and 2 with Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma) provided extensive data highlighting the potential connection between anti-TNF\u03b1 agents and cutaneous lymphoma [66]. In most patients, a primary skin disorder was the indication for the use of anti-TNF\u03b1 agents. The majority of them had been clinically diagnosed with psoriasis, psoriasiform dermatitis, or idiopathic erythroderma prior to the use of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy. A baseline biopsy was performed in 83.3% of patients with cutaneous disorder. None of the performed biopsies has shown any features of cutaneous lymphoma, and the most frequent histologic diagnosis was \u201cpsoriasis\u201d or \u201cpsoriasiform dermatitis\u201d. The median time from anti-TNF\u03b1 initiation to a histologically confirmed cutaneous lymphoma diagnosis was 6 months (range: 1\u201324 months). So far, a total of 31 cases have been reported in the literature with presentation of cutaneous lymphoma after treatment with anti-TNF\u03b1 agents [[24], [25], [26]].\n\nData on the association between CTCL and non-anti-TNF\u03b1 biologics are scant. There have been no reported cases connecting the onset of MF with the anti-IL12/23 biologic ustekinumab. Interestingly, Yoo et al. have shown the histopathologic confirmation of MF after 12 and 8 weeks of secukinumab (interleukin-17A antagonist) use for psoriasis treatment in two cases [28]. Inhibition of the Th17-mediated immune response may theoretically lead to further immunosuppression and disease progression in CTCL by shifting the Th17/Tregs equilibrium towards Tregs that may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CTLC [28]. However, the major limitation of this study was the non-performance of a baseline skin biopsy before secukinumab initiation, implying that the two patients may have probably suffered from MF instead of psoriasis. Additionally, these patients had failed to respond to other psoriasis treatments before secukinumab, such as apremilast, NB-UVB phototherapy and acitretin. Interestingly, there have also been reported CTCL-like cases triggered by drugs [67]. However, these cases should not be considered true lymphomas, but rather lymphomatoid drug reactions. Their prominent characteristic is that the dermopathy subsides with the withdrawal of the incriminating medication. Therefore, these cases should not be confused with true lymphomas that could be triggered by TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors [66].\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nPsoriasis and MF are two distinct entities sharing common pathogenetic features associated with the abnormal activation of T-cells. Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that psoriatic patients may develop MF in the course of the disease. Dermatologists should be aware of an elevated risk of CTCL, particularly MF, in patients with psoriasis. To what degree psoriasis itself through chronic immune stimulation, or the medications used for its treatment or comorbidities and lifestyle may play a role in the onset of MF is not yet clear. There is not sufficient evidence to support a causal association between the use of biological therapies and MF in patients with psoriasis. Besides, MF can be an imitator of psoriasis \u2013both clinically and histopathologically\u2013 an entity referred to as \u201cpsoriasiform MF\u201d. Biopsy of the cutaneous lesions before the introduction of biologics should be incorporated in the clinical practice. Biopsy of the cutaneous lesion should also be performed in the case of appearance of psoriasiform lesions during biologic treatment for autoimmune disorders because this may represent an indolent form of MF. Psoriatic patients with poor or no-response to treatment should be examined thoroughly for MF using immunochemistry and, if necessary, molecular biology techniques. In cases where histologic features of both MF and psoriasis are found, combination treatment should be given addressing both disorders. A large multicentric registry of MF patients who were treated for benign dermatoses (i.e. eczema, psoriasis) with classic immunosuppressive drugs and/or biologics is needed to collect data and further clarify the enigmatic association between psoriasis, MF and immunomodulatory treatment. Finally, larger well-designed prospective studies in patients with histologically confirmed psoriasis are required to elucidate the association between psoriasis, its treatment and MF.\n\nFinancial support\n\nNone.\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n\nNo conflict of interest to disclose.",

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nCardiac arrest caused by accidental severe hypothermia and myocardial infarction during general anesthesia.\n\nABSTRACT:\nTherapeutic hypothermia is often used for traumatic brain injury because of its neuroprotective effect and decreased secondary brain injury. However, this procedure lacks clinical evidence supporting its efficacy, and adverse outcomes have been reported during general anesthesia. A 61-year-old man with a history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was admitted with traumatic brain injury. Immediately after admission, he underwent mild therapeutic hypothermia with a target temperature of 33.0\u00b0C for neuroprotection. During general anesthesia for emergency surgery because he developed a mass effect, hypothermic cardiac arrest occurred following an additional decrease in the core body temperature. Moreover, myocardial infarction caused by restenosis of the previous PCI lesion also contributed to the cardiac arrest. Although the patient recovered spontaneous circulation after an hour-long cardiopulmonary resuscitation with rewarming, he eventually died of subsequent repetitive cardiac arrests. When anesthetizing patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, caution is required to prevent adverse outcomes that can be caused by unintentional severe hypothermia and exacerbation of underlying heart disease.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\nTherapeutic hypothermia is an attractive strategy for traumatic brain injury (TBI), which demonstrates neuroprotective effects and decreases secondary brain injury.1 Despite the lack of clinical evidence regarding efficacy, therapeutic hypothermia after TBI has been used for at least half a century because of its potential benefits, which are supported by numerous preclinical studies.2,3 However, there have been no reports on the danger of unintentional severe hypothermia during general anesthesia caused by the additional drop in temperature of patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. When anesthetizing patients with comorbidities, such as ischemic heart disease, caution is required to prevent adverse outcomes that can be caused by unintentional severe hypothermia and exacerbation of underlying heart disease.4,5\n\nCase report\nA 61-year-old man (height, 168 cm; weight, 70 kg) presented to our emergency room (ER) with head trauma after falling on a cement floor from a 5-meter-tall construction site. Upon arrival at the ER, the patient had a Glasgow coma scale score of 11 and the following vital signs: blood pressure (BP), 147/83\u2009mmHg; heart rate (HR), 86 beats per minute (bpm); respiratory rate, 24 breaths per minute; body temperature from the auditory canal, 36.8\u00b0C; and percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2), 97%. Upon discovering signs of acute subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage from a brain computed tomography (CT) scan performed in the ER, we admitted the patient to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. After approximately 6 hours, we performed follow-up brain CT because the patient\u2019s mental status had deteriorated from drowsy to stupor. Upon observing a mass effect characterized by an increase in the hemorrhage volume and a left midline shift on the CT images, the patient was scheduled for immediate intubation and emergency decompressive craniectomy (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Brain computed tomography (CT) images taken 6 hours after intensive care unit admission. (a) Axial view showing acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the peri-mesencephalic cistern (arrow A) and subdural hemorrhage in the right inferior temporal (arrow B) and right parietal (arrow C) regions. (b) Axial view showing acute subdural hemorrhage in the right temporal region (black arrow) and left midline shift.\n\nAlthough the patient had a history of ischemic heart disease with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), it was difficult to obtain accurate information because there was no relevant data in the patient\u2019s medical records from the authors\u2019 hospital, and his drowsy state interfered with detailed interviews. According to the chest CT scan performed immediately after admission, coronary stents had been inserted at the bifurcation site of the left main coronary artery (Figure 2). It also appeared that the inserted stents were drug-eluting stents (DES) considering that he had received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix\u00ae; Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) a switching platelet P2Y12 inhibitor, for approximately 4 months. However, DAPT was discontinued owing to the worsening cerebral hemorrhage after hospitalization; bridging antiplatelet therapy was also not performed. Before the surgery, the patient showed a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), and cardiac biomarker testing revealed a troponin-T concentration of 0.006\u2009\u00b5g/L, which was within normal limits (Figure 3). The patient demonstrated satisfactory functional capacity to be able to work at a construction site just before the trauma. Therefore, an additional preoperative cardiac evaluation was not considered necessary.\n\nFigure 2. Chest computed tomography (CT) images showing coronary stents in the main bifurcation of the left coronary arteries (white arrow in (a) and (b)).\n\nFigure 3. Preoperative electrocardiogram of the patient showing normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 95 bpm.\n\nbpm, beats per minute.\n\nImmediately after admission to the ICU, the patient\u2019s bladder temperature was 38.0\u00b0C. Using a hydrogel-coated water-circulating pad (Arctic Sun\u00ae; Medivance Inc., Louisville, CO, USA), which is a surface cooling device, the patient underwent mild therapeutic hypothermia with a target temperature of 33.0\u00b0C. During therapeutic hypothermia, sedation and shivering control were performed using continuous rate infusions of midazolam at 5\u2009mg/hour and remifentanil at 0.2 \u00b5g/kg/minute. The patient\u2019s bladder temperature was 33.4\u00b0C just before he was transferred to the operating room. Preoperative laboratory tests showed no unusual findings except for mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (73 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (51\u2009U/L) concentrations.\n\nThe patient\u2019s vital signs upon arrival at the operating room were a BP of 130/70\u2009mmHg and SpO2 of 100%. Lead II of the ECG was monitored, and there were no unusual findings except sinus tachycardia with an HR of 100 bpm on the initial ECG. Arterial BP (ABP), central venous pressure (CVP), and esophageal temperature were monitored from the right radial artery, right subclavian vein, and lower third of the esophagus using a temperature sensor attached to the esophageal stethoscope, respectively. The initial ABP, CVP, and esophageal temperature were 140/85\u2009mmHg, 6\u2009mmHg, and 33.0\u00b0C, respectively. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed in the arterial line, with values calculated as for a body temperature of 37\u00b0C, which revealed the following: pH, 7.400; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), 40\u2009mmHg; partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), 174\u2009mmHg; bicarbonate (HCO3), 24.8\u2009mmol/L; base excess, 0.0; lactate, 0.17\u2009mmol/L; ionized calcium, 1.04\u2009mmol/L; and potassium, 3.3\u2009mmol/L. Total intravenous (IV) anesthesia was performed using a target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil in accordance with the Schnider6 and Minto7 models, respectively. Propofol and remifentanil were infused continuously with effect-site concentrations (Ce) of 1.5 \u00b5g/mL and 1.5 ng/mL, respectively. Concurrently, 50\u2009mg of rocuronium was administered by IV bolus injection for neuromuscular blockade. Mechanical ventilation was adjusted to maintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide value at 30 to 33\u2009mmHg.\n\nAs ABP decreased to 78/42\u2009mmHg and CVP decreased to 4\u2009mmHg within 10 minutes after anesthesia, the Ce of propofol and remifentanil were lowered to 0.8 \u00b5g/mL and 1.0 ng/mL, respectively, and approximately 1 L of balanced crystalloid fluid loading was performed. However, the patient\u2019s BP did not recover, and a dopamine continuous infusion (5 \u00b5g/kg/minute) was initiated. When a surgical incision was made 10 minutes after beginning the dopamine infusion, the patient\u2019s ABP and HR increased to 115/70\u2009mmHg and 120 bpm, respectively, and marked ST-segment depression (\u22122.4\u2009mm) was found, which was not observed on the preoperative or initial ECGs (Figure 4). Subsequently, the depth of anesthesia was increased by increasing the Ce of propofol to 1.0 to 1.2 \u00b5g/mL, followed by a continuous infusion of isosorbide dinitrate (1 \u00b5g/kg/minute). While HR was maintained at 110 to 120 bpm, ABP gradually decreased to 70/40\u2009mmHg after approximately 5 minutes. To treat the hypotension, isosorbide dinitrate was discontinued, and a bolus injection of 100 \u00b5g phenylephrine was administered, after which, ABP increased temporarily to 95/60\u2009mmHg. Subsequently, HR decreased suddenly and rapidly, and ventricular fibrillation occurred. The anesthesiologists immediately discontinued the surgery and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient\u2019s esophageal temperature at the time was 32.0\u00b0C.\n\nFigure 4. Intraoperative electrocardiogram of the patient showing sinus tachycardia with significant ST depression. The ST depression on the monitor represented approximately \u22122.4 at the time.\n\nChest compressions were performed with periodic defibrillation with 200 J, and epinephrine injections were administered every 3 minutes; these measures elicited no response. During CPR, ECG monitoring showed temporary severe bradycardia (HR, 10\u201330 bpm). However, this was considered pulseless electrical activity because no pulse was detected in the patient\u2019s femoral artery. Soon afterward, there was a rapid transition to ventricular fibrillation, and CPR was repeated. At the time, the patient\u2019s esophageal temperature dropped to 30.0\u00b0C. According to the refractory state after the defibrillation and drug injections, we considered that the cardiac arrest was caused by hypothermia. To reverse the cause, a forced-air warming device and a warming blanket (Bair Hugger\u00ae; Arizant Healthcare Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA) were used for surface warming, the IV fluids were warmed, and surgical wound closure and dressing were performed rapidly to prevent surface heat loss. The first arterial blood gas analysis after ventricular fibrillation, calculated as for a body temperature of 37\u00b0C, showed the following: pH, 7.690; PCO2, 15\u2009mmHg; PO2, 260\u2009mmHg; HCO3, 18.1\u2009mmol/L; base excess, \u22121.2; lactate, 0.33\u2009mmol/L; ionized calcium, 0.88\u2009mmol/L; and potassium, 5.0\u2009mmol/L. Follow-up arterial blood gas analyses were repeated periodically. As we continued to perform CPR, the patient developed severe metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia characterized by a pH of 6.840, HCO3 of 15.4\u2009mmol/L, and ionized calcium of 0.66\u2009mmol/L. To correct the abnormal findings, we administered appropriate amounts of sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride. After an hour-long CPR and rewarming, the patient\u2019s esophageal temperature recovered to 33.0\u00b0C, which was followed by observing sinus rhythm characterized by an HR of 75 bpm on an ECG monitor and detecting a pulse in the femoral artery with a characteristic ABP waveform that eventually led to the recovery of BP to 130/55\u2009mmHg. Upon confirming recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the patient was transported to the ICU while we administered dopamine (10\u2009\u00b5g/kg/minute), norepinephrine (0.1\u2009\u00b5g/kg/minute), and vasopressin (2\u2009U/hour). ABP, HR, and esophageal temperature during anesthesia are shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5. Changes in vital signs (blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and esophageal temperature) over time (5-minute intervals).\n\nbpm, beats per minute.\n\nCardiac biomarker testing performed after the patient\u2019s transfer to the ICU showed an increased troponin-T level of 1.432 \u00b5g/L. Portable Doppler transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed total occlusion of the left main coronary artery, which had undergone PCI previously. Because emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was impossible at the time, repeated PCI was considered an alternative treatment option. However, even after his transfer to the ICU, the patient experienced repetitive ventricular fibrillation. Four hours after the patient\u2019s transfer to the ICU, the patient\u2019s guardian requested that CPR should be stopped. Without resuscitation, the patient died.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this case, the patient, who was receiving therapeutic hypothermia, underwent emergency craniectomy owing to worsening brain hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest occurred during general anesthesia. We deduced that the cardiac arrest was owing to the additional decrease in the patient\u2019s core body temperature and myocardial infarction caused by restenosis of the previous PCI-treated lesion.\n\nTherapeutic hypothermia is used to improve neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest, TBI, stroke, and hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy.1,4 Studies on the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia for TBI have been less convincing, and they show conflicting results. However, hypothermia is consistently used as an option for TBI because it reduces intracranial pressure and the cerebral metabolic rate, thereby protecting neuronal function in the brain and decreasing the wide range of injuries or reparative processes by attenuating temperature-sensitive mechanisms, such as excitotoxicity, free radical generation, apoptosis, and inflammation.1,2\n\nThe cardiovascular effects associated with hypothermia are complex. Hypothermia affects the electrical conduction of myocardial cells, which can induce hypotension or bradycardia and even increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation by prolonging repolarization.4,8 However, mild hypothermia of 32.0\u00b0C to 35.0\u00b0C demonstrates cardioprotective effects by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and increasing myocardial perfusion through vasodilation of coronary vessels.9 Therefore, there has been a growing interest in the clinical use of mild therapeutic hypothermia as an adjunctive therapy during ischemic heart disease.10 Our patient received mild therapeutic hypothermia with a target core temperature of 33.0\u00b0C, which may have yielded cardioprotective as well as neuroprotective benefits.11\n\nDuring general anesthesia, hypothermia is induced following an increase in heat loss caused by peripheral vasodilation after the injection of anesthetic drugs, heat redistribution from the core to the periphery, and impaired normal thermoregulatory responses, such as vasoconstriction or shivering.5 In our patient, the cold operating room temperature and irrigating an uncovered surgical area in the brain with cold saline also may have contributed to the additional core body temperature drop in addition to the effects of general anesthesia.12 However, in our case, neurosurgeons requested that anesthesiologists not perform warming during anesthesia. Instead, esophageal temperature and signs that could result from hypothermia, such as ECG changes, were carefully monitored. The esophageal temperature decreased from 33.0\u00b0C, which was measured immediately after entering the operation room, to 32.0\u00b0C at the time of cardiac arrest. The esophageal temperature further decreased to a minimum of 30.0\u00b0C during CPR. With rewarming, the temperature recovered to 33.0\u00b0C and finally, ROSC was achieved. Considering that chest compressions, drugs, and defibrillation did not induce ROSC, which was achieved with the recovery of an esophageal temperature of 33.0\u00b0C, the additional rapid fall in the patient\u2019s core body temperature during anesthesia may have caused the cardiac arrest.\n\nIn this case study, we suspected that restenosis at the site of the previous stent insertion contributed to the cardiac arrest, given the following three findings: First, the patient had a normal preoperative ECG with no signs of ischemia but developed ST-segment depression during anesthesia. Second, repetitive cardiac arrests occurred even after achieving ROSC with rewarming. Third, an increased troponin-T concentration was observed, and suspected re-stenotic occlusion of the left main coronary artery was confirmed by Doppler TTE after the patient\u2019s transfer to the ICU. Accordingly, myocardial infarction was considered the main cause of death.\n\nThe mechanisms of myocardial infarction owing to stent restenosis after DES insertion are rapid stent thrombosis or profuse in-stent restenosis (ISR).13 We assume that the lesion characteristics in the left main bifurcation of the coronary artery and DAPT interruption owing to the increasing amount of cerebral hemorrhage contributed to the stent restenosis in this patient. As evidence in support of this assumption, previous studies have shown that stenting at the left main bifurcation and DAPT interruption are strong risk factors for stent thrombosis or ISR.14,15 While controversial, not interrupting aspirin perioperatively could have avoided poor outcomes.16 However, there were no clinical signs related to expected ongoing restenosis of the coronary artery or myocardial ischemia preoperatively in our patient. We suspect that the possible ischemic signs may have been masked by the aforementioned cardioprotective benefits of therapeutic hypothermia. We also believe that the following three conditions contributed to the intraoperative myocardial ischemia and infarction caused by acute restenosis of the coronary stent: First, intraoperative hypotension may have contributed to myocardial injury. The IV anesthetics used during anesthesia, propofol and remifentanil, induced redistribution of blood volume by peripheral vasodilation, resulting in profound hypotension.4 Profound hypotension was strongly associated with myocardial injury and especially harmful for this patient, who had preexisting ischemic heart disease.17 Second, tachycardia, which may have been caused by the inotrope dopamine, used to compensate for the low BP or the stress response to surgical stimulation from shallow anesthetic depth, may have triggered myocardial ischemia by decreasing oxygen delivery and increasing oxygen consumption.17,18 If cardiogenic shock is suspected, as in our case, norepinephrine could be a better option than dopamine.19 Third, the bolus injection of phenylephrine, a selective \u03b11-adrenergic agonist, just before cardiac arrest may have temporarily and abruptly increased cardiac afterload and impaired myocardial perfusion.20\n\nHad we known that coronary artery occlusion would result from hypothermia-induced cardiac arrest and coronary stent restenosis, the treatment of choice would have been CABG surgery while maintaining circulation with emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) via the femoral artery and vein.11 However, it was difficult to determine the etiology of the cardiac arrest at the time. Even if we had known the cause, ideal treatment would have been impossible, given circumstances beyond our control; all thoracic surgeons were busy operating, and emergency CPB and ECMO were not available. As an alternative, repeat PCI after the patient achieved ROSC could have been performed. However, the patient had a prolonged CPR duration, and he did not maintain the ROSC state for a period sufficient for intervention, which led to a poor outcome.\n\nIn this case, it was not possible to accurately determine the reason for the cardiac arrest and for not achieving consistent ROSC. Instead, we conclude that cardiac arrest developed and persisted as a result of the unintentional severe hypothermia that occurred during general anesthesia and/or coronary artery restenosis at the site of the previous PCI. A thorough evaluation of heart-related history is required for TBI patients who have a history of ischemic heart diseases and who undergo therapeutic hypothermia because there may be undiscovered coronary insufficiency owing to the cardioprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia. In addition, careful monitoring of the patient\u2019s core body temperature, and preventive and countermeasures should be fully prepared and taken against adverse hemodynamic effects, even cardiac arrest, which can occur because of additive hypothermic responses during anesthesia.\n\nEthics statement: This case report was approved by our Institutional Review Board (EMC 2020-05-005-001), and the case report was performed in compliance with the EQUATOR Network guidelines (the CARE guidelines).

To date, there has been no definite laboratory or imaging test available for diagnosing AOSD; the diagnosis is one of exclusion, which can be very challenging. In particular, AOSD patients may experience different complications affecting their clinical picture, management, and prognosis. The treatment of AOSD remains largely empirical and involves therapeutic agents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe report the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented with fever, red rash, arthralgia, and sore throat. Her serum ferritin level and white blood cell count were markedly elevated, and the first diagnosis 22 years prior was \"juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of systemic type\". The patient was treated with prednisone, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and leflunomide. After remission of her symptoms, the patient stopped taking the medications, and the disease recurred. Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with adult-onset Still's disease. Relapse occurred several times due to self-medication withdrawal, and an interleukin-6 antagonist (tocilizumab/Actemra) was administered to control the disease. Recently, she was hospitalized because an incision did not heal, and the patient suddenly developed high fever and diarrhea during hospitalization. The patient's disease progressed violently and quickly developed into macrophage activation syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, and multiple organ failure. The patient had sudden cardiac arrest, and she died despite emergency rescue efforts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAOSD patients need regular follow-up in the long-term treatment process, and must press formulary standard medication, and do not voluntarily withdraw or reduce the dose. Otherwise it may cause disease back-and-forth or serious life-threatening complications. Meanwhile, strict management of trauma, infections, tumors, and other diseases may contribute to improved outcomes in patients with complications.\n\nTEXT:\nCore Tip: Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease, and the lack of disease-specific symptoms and laboratory markers hinders the diagnosis and assessment of its progression. More importantly, the treatment of AOSD remains largely empirical, with a lack of controlled clinical trials. Few cases of the disease with multiple complications have been reported. The present case highlights the characteristics of AOSD and severe complications and shares our experience in its diagnosis and treatment to provide experience for the effective recognition and treatment of this disease. The authors also note the link between the biopsychosocial model and autoimmune diseases.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAdult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease, which is characterized by fever, arthritis, an evanescent rash, and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Other nonspecific symptoms may be observed in AOSD, such as sore throat, cardiopulmonary features, kidney disease, and neurological manifestations[1,2]. AOSD was definitively described in 1971 by Eric Bywaters, who named the disease on account of its close resemblance to the pediatric syndrome systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA), which was formerly called \u201cStill's disease\u201d for the reason that it was described by Dr George Still in 1897[3,4]. The etiology is unknown, and both infectious triggers and genetic factors have been suggested, but there is no clear evidence of an infectious etiology[5].\n\nAvailable epidemiologic results show that the incidence of AOSD ranges between 0.16 and 0.4/100000 people, with an estimated prevalence rate between 1 and 34 cases/1 million people[2,6,7]. Based on some reports, females seem to be more affected than males; however, AOSD is considered to be evenly distributed between the sexes. AOSD usually afflicts young people, with a bimodal peak at ages 15-25 and 36-46 years[2,8]. Diagnosis is based on clinical grounds, following the exclusion of mimickers of autoimmune, infectious, and neoplastic disorders, with the additional consideration of nonspecific laboratory abnormalities such as elevation of serum ferritin (SF), peripheral leukocytosis, and other acute-phase reactants[9]. In general, the absence of disease-specific symptoms and laboratory markers hinders its diagnosis, and the lack of established disease activity markers makes the determination of treatment efficacy problematic. More importantly, AOSD-related complications are significantly associated with mortality. These patients may also experience different complications that affect their clinical symptoms, management, and prognosis. Moreover, clinical progression is also unpredictable, with 60%-70% of those patients developing a chronic form of the disease[2].\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\nChief complaints\nA 36-year-old woman presented to the Outpatient Department of our hospital complaining of poor wound healing of an incision in her right hip and AOSD.\n\nHistory of present illness\nShe had developed steroid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis caused by long-term prednisone therapy for AOSD, and the incision had not healed by 2 mo after bilateral prosthetic replacement. She was hospitalized for treatment in a stable condition. During hospitalization, the patient suddenly developed high fever and diarrhea, with the highest temperature reaching 38.2 \u00b0C, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and mild dehydration. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after refusing fluid rehydration therapy with deep-vein puncture. After further inquiry about the patient's history, her husband said that her AOSD was greatly affected by her mood, and the patient had a high fever of 41 \u00b0C lasting for 1 mo due to depression\". The next day, her condition suddenly deteriorated, blood pressure decreased, and her dyspnea, oliguria, and disease rapidly worsened.\n\nHistory of past illness\nTwenty-two years prior (at 14 years old, 1998), fever occurred due to overfright, with the highest body temperature reaching 40 \u00b0C; her body temperature often increased in the morning. This was accompanied by a red rash on her back, sore throat, migratory swelling, and pain of multiple joints and muscle in the whole body, mainly affecting the proximal interphalangeal joint of both hands, metacarpophalangeal joint, double wrist joint, double elbow joint, and bilateral temporomandibular joint. Her symptoms associated with morning stiffness eased slightly after 1 h of activity. Test results showed that SF was increased and white blood cells (WBCs) obviously increased. The first diagnosis was \"juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of systemic type\", and the patient was treated with prednisone up to 30 mg/d, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and leflunomide. After her symptoms improved, the patient stopped taking the medicines. The disease then recurred, and she was diagnosed with \"AOSD\" and was treated with prednisone at a dose up to 60 mg (1 mg/kg), methotrexate, and traditional Chinese medicine, resulting in short-term improvement of symptoms. In 2002, bilateral alternating hip pain began to appear. After that, movement of both hip joints and knee joints was limited, with overflexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints of fingers and feet. In 2015, X-ray of her hands was performed, showing a narrow joint space of the hands and wrists. X-ray of the hip joint revealed a flattened femoral head on both sides, with multiple transparent shadows and hyperosteogeny and sclerosis, and the acetabular bone on both sides was obviously thinner; some bones were discontinuous, with hyperosteogeny and cystic shadow, and the joint space of both hips became obviously narrow. During this period, the disease recurred many times, and the patient took oral prednisone, lothorofan, and leflumide intermittently. Methotrexate, iguratimod, and Tripterygium wilfordii were discontinued due to adverse effects. In April 2016, the patient began treatment with etanercept. After that, due to frequent recurrence of the disease, the patient began to receive regular monthly intravenous administration of an interleukin (IL)-6 antagonist (Actemra) at 320 mg, and the dose of prednisone was reduced to 10 mg/d. In April 2020, she was hospitalized with the aggravation of pain in both hip joints and a limp. The test results showed that WBC count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and SF were normal. Bilateral femoral head necrosis was definitively diagnosed, and bilateral prosthetic replacement was performed. Two months after the surgery, the patient did withdrawal of Actemra and immuno-suppressive agents on her own.\n\nPhysical examination\nAfter her second day in the ICU, the patient\u2019s temperature was 36.5 \u00b0C, her heart rate was 96 bpm, her respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, her blood pressure was 80/41 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation in room air was 88%-96%. The patient was under some type of sedation but responded to painful stimuli. A 1 cm unhealed incision was seen on the right hip, with seepage of a reddish fluid. Other physical examinations showed no abnormal signs.\n\nLaboratory examinations\nOn the first day in the ICU, laboratory parameters showed abnormalities of routine blood examination, coagulation function, hepatic function, and serum electrolytes (Table 1, Day 1).\n\nTable 1 Main laboratory findings (Day 1 to Day 4)\n\n\nMain laboratory finding\n\n\t\nValue\n\n\t\nNormal range\n\n\t\n\nDay 1\n\n\t\nDay 2\n\n\t\nDay 3\n\n\t\nDay 4\n\n\t\nWhite blood cell count\t5.0\t5.6\t20.5\t28.3\t(3.5-9.5) \u00d7 109/L\t\nLymphocyte percentage\t6.6\t10.1\t8.9\t15.6\t20%-50%\t\nNeutrophil percentage\t90\t86.7\t90.1\t81\t40%-75%\t\nHemoglobin\t80\t99\t112\t98\t(115-150) g/L\t\nPlatelets\t30\t32\t52\t35\t(125-350) \u00d7 109/L\t\nProthrombin time\t18.1\t18.8\t18.2\t16.4\t(9-14) s\t\nInternational normalized ratio \t1.6\t1.68\t1.62\t1.42\t\t\nProthrombin activity\t54.9\t51.8\t54.2\t63\t%\t\nActivated partial thromboplastin time standardization\t61\t55.3\t54.1\t56.8\t(20-40) s\t\nThrombin\u2002time\t39.7\t37.1\t50.6\tChyle blood, no test\t(14-21) s\t\nFibrinogen\t1.37\t1.0\t0.77\tChyle blood, no test\t(2-4) g/L\t\nD-Dimer\t\t4.88\t\t5.96\t(0-0.5) \u03bcg/L\t\nFibrinogen degradation products\t\t272.9\t\t90.6\t(0-5) \u03bcg/L\t\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\t\t\t10\t\t(0-20) mm/L\t\nC-reactive protein\t\t121.01\t111.7\t104.2\t(0-10) mg/L\t\nHemolytic index\t15\t15\t60\t55\t0-15\t\nBlood lipid index\t2\t2\t2\t225\t0-2\t\nTotal protein\t57.1\t53.5\t46.8\t55.7\t(65-85) g/L\t\nAlbumin\t28.8\t26.3\t26.3\t23.2\t(40-55) g/L\t\nGlobin\t28.3\t27.3\t26.2\t24.4\t(20-40) g/L\t\nTotal bilirubin\t35.9\t42.9\t49.6\t62.1\t(0-21) \u03bcmol/L\t\nConjugated\u2002bilirubin\t14.6\t19.5\t27.3\t35.2\t(0-5) \u03bcmol/L\t\nUnconjugated hyperbilirubinemia\t3.5\t3.5\t2.6\t4.2\t(0-19) \u03bcmol/L\t\nGlutamic-pyruvic\u2002transaminase\t84.9\t90.9\t139.8\t153.8\t(0-40) U/L\t\nAspartate aminotransferase\t295\t329\t593\t589\t(0-40) U/L\t\nAlkaline phosphatase\t366\t510\t508\t453\t(38-126) U/L\t\n\u03b3-Glutamyl transpeptidase\t118\t161\t185\t183\t(6-35) U/L\t\nCholinesterase\t3584.3\t3395.1\t3476.1\t4351.8\t(4650-12220) U/L\t\nLactate dehydrogenase\t5292\t5616\t9299\t8746\t(313-618) U/L\t\nK+\t4.9\t4.57\t4.42\t5.3\t(3.6-5) mm/L\t\nNa+\t127.8\t128.9\t142.6\t146.2\t(137-145) mm/L\t\nCl-\t102\t103.9\t111.8\t106.7\t(98-107) mm/L\t\nCreatinine\t288.1\t299.2\t298.8\t311.5\t(41-73) \u03bcmol/L\t\nCarbamide\t16.19\t17.79\t22.38\t28.01\t(2.6-7.5) mm/L\t\nUric acid\t683\t706.4\t487.4\t510.4\t(155-357) \u03bcmol/L\t\nHypersensitive troponin\t0.012\t0.138\t13\t52\t(0-0.034) ng/L\t\nNT-ProBNP\t4120\t9910\t35000\t35000\t(0-125) pg/L\t\nMyoglobin\t\t145.7\t\t936.4\t(0-110) ng/moL\t\nProcalcitonin\t\t10.479\t\t24.025\t(0-0.05) ng/mL\t\nThis table shows the main laboratory findings of the patient during the intensive care unit.\n\nImaging examinations\nAbdominal B-ultrasonography revealed splenomegaly. X-ray of the hip joints showed that the shape and position of bilateral prosthesis were normal, and there were no signs of infection.\n\nFurther diagnostic work-up\nOver the next 3 d in the ICU, the laboratory parameters of routine blood examination, coagulation function, hepatic function, and serum electrolyte deteriorated further (Table 1, Day 2, 3 and 4).\n\nThe level of SF was more than 10000 ng/mL (normal range: 13-150 ng/mL). The level of general cortisol was more than 1649.9 mmol/L (101.2-535.7 mmol/L), and that of adrenocorticotrophic hormone was less than 1.54 mL/L (7.2-63.6 mL/L). Serum \u03ba and \u03bb light chain levels were 60.9 mg/L (6.7-22.4 mg/L) and 1.62 (0.31-1.56 mg/L), respectively, and the ratio of \u03ba/\u03bb was 1.62 (0.31-1.56). Other immunological tests were almost within the normal range, including anti-phospholipid antibodies, immunoglobulin, complement, rheumatoid factor (RF), antistreptolysin O test, anti-CCP antibody, autoimmune antibody tests, and Coombs test (MGCT). No bacteria or fungi were found in blood culture, sputum culture, or secretions of surgical wound. Routine urine tests indicated urine protein 2+, occult blood 2+, and WBCs 188.5 mL/L, with no other abnormality found. Fecal flora analysis indicated 100% Enterobacter spp. The examination of lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokines was ongoing.\n\nMULTIDISCIPLINARY EXPERT CONSULTATION\nGiven the multiple organ involvement and high SF and WBC levels, and the patient's history of stopping Actemra and immunosuppressive agents on her own for 2 mo, the diagnosis of active AOSD was confirmed by multidisciplinary expert consultation. It was discussed whether the diarrhea was a second hit. Diarrhea may trigger a pathologic process in genetically susceptible patients, finally leading to an uncontrollable increase in proinflammatory cytokines, with a severe systemic inflammatory reaction, which is responsible for AOSD development. It was agreed that the large dose of cortisol impulse therapy up to 200 mg per day was a reasonable treatment and that immunomodulatory and inflammatory suppression should be continued. Hemodialysis should also be performed to remove metabolic wastes and inflammatory factors from the blood. Furthermore, the examination of lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokines should be carried out to detect disease activity. If necessary, the patient should undergo bone marrow biopsy, flow cytometry, and chromosome testing. Treatment with cortisol at a dose of 200 mg/d was re-commended, and hemodialysis was performed. In the case of nonresponse, it was decided to consider treatment with Actemra and cyclosporine.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS\nThe final diagnoses of the presented case were shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (acute heart failure, acute liver failure, acute respiratory dysfunction, and abnormal coagulation function), AOSD, acute gastroenteritis, postoperative nonunion of the right hip, electrolyte disorder, anemia, and hypoproteinemia.\n\nTREATMENT\nAfter comprehensive treatment, such as anti-shock, blood transfusion, auxiliary ventilation, plasma exchange, and cortisol impulse treatment, the patient\u2019s body temperature returned to normal, but her diarrhea was not relieved.\n\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\nOn the third day in the ICU, the patient\u2019s condition worsened; her blood pressure suddenly dropped to 50/30 mmHg, and she did not respond to increased epinephrine and dopamine doses or intravenous epinephrine. In the end, the patient had sudden cardiac arrest, and she died despite emergency rescue efforts.\n\nDISCUSSION\nAOSD is classified as a multigenic autoinflammatory disease because of its complex pathogenesis, involving both the innate and adaptive immune systems. It is generally considered that some unknown factors, playing as second hits, may startup a pathologic procedure in genetically susceptible patients, eventually leading to the activation of an aberrant inflammatory response, which leads to the development of AOSD. Although the pathogenesis is mostly unknown, the pivotal role of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor, and ferritin in developing the inflammatory vicious circle has been reported[10-13]. There are six sets of criteria for the diagnosis of AOSD currently, and Yamaguchi's criteria are the most sensitive as well as the most widely used. The criteria include fever evanescent rash, arthralgia, and leukocytosis as major items and other nonspecific symptoms, such as sore throat, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, deterioration of liver function, negative rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibody as minor items; more than five items including at least two major criteria are necessary for the diagnosis and to exclude malignancy or infectious disease[14].\n\nAOSD typically manifests with a symptomatic triad characterized by fever (60%-100%), red rash (60%-80%), and arthralgia and arthritis (70%-100%) which may develop to destructive symmetric polyarthritis[1]. In AOSD, fever always precedes other manifestations' onset, and the fever shows an abrupt onset usually, commonly once or twice the quotidian pattern, with the highest temperature detected in the early evening or late afternoon. The temperature may sometimes return to a normal value without any antipyretic treatment. The rash is usually observed on the proximal trunk and limbs, appearing during the febrile attacks, and its typically histopathology shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, surrounding the perivascular areas without epidermal changes. Joint disease is also a common sign. Arthritis and arthralgia mostly affect knees, wrists, and ankles. Some patients may gradually develop chronic destructive symmetrical polyarthritis and ankylosis in subsequent years. Laboratory test of joint fluid may show an inflammatory fluid with neutrophil predominance. Other nonspecific symptoms may be found in AOSD, such as sore throat, cardiopulmonary features, kidney disease, neurological manifestations, enlargement of cervical lymph nodes (LNs), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, and increased hepatic enzymes[15].\n\nLaboratory tests commonly show increased SF, CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), neutrophilic leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The levels of SF are higher than those observed in other autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic diseases. It has been reported that SF is an acute-phase protein released from impaired hepatocytes; the levels may be elevated in inflammatory disorders, alcohol abuse, liver disease, infectious diseases such as HIV infection, or malignancy[16]. Eighty percent of AOSD patients were reported to have increased ferritin levels, 70% of which were more than five times the normal upper limit[17]. The median level of SF in AOSD patients is reportedly 4752 ng/mL. A SF level higher than 10000 ng/mL can be a specific marker for AOSD if there is no severe liver dysfunction or history of multiple blood transfusions, but the SF level itself is only a nonspecific marker for inflammation[18-20]. Due to its low specificity, elevated SF is not included in this disease's diagnostic criteria, but we consider that this association is worth highlighting, given that younger age and the nonspecific nature of most presentations often lead to delayed diagnosis[21-23]. It has been reported that proinflammatory cytokine levels are significantly increased in both the pathological tissues and sera of patients with active or untreated AOSD, and that ferritin synthesis is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines at various levels during cellular differentiation, proliferation, and inflammation. Cytokines may also have an effect on ferritin translation indirectly by their ability to increase inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and hence increase the levels of NO. NO in turn induces ferritin expression. These reports suggest that the level of ferritin might be a good biomarker to monitor the disease activity of AOSD[10,24]. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis are reportedly promoted along with rises in SF levels, which is associated with AOSD's disease activity strongly and may also be a biomarker of AOSD[25,26]. Some studies have confirmed that SF and heme oxygenase 1 can serve as highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for AOSD[27].\n\nAOSD patients may experience different complications affecting their clinical manifestations, management, and prognosis. The major cause of death is infection, followed by severe complications. Important systemic complications of AOSD reported until\u2002now include macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), thrombotic microangiopathy, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary arterial hypertension, shock, multiple organ failure, myocarditis, tamponade, constrictive endocarditis, pericarditis, fulminant hepatitis, and amyloidosis[9,15,28].\n\nMAS or reactive hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a potentially life-threatening complication characterized by excessive macrophage activity and cytokine production leading to multiple organ failure[29,30]. Primary MAS commonly occurs in children with MAS-associated genetic defects or a family history of MAS, while secondary MAS occurs after exposure to immunological trigger factors of underlying autoimmune diseases, infections, malignancies, or flares of AOSD[31]. It is reported that the incidence of MAS is up to 15% among those AOSD patients and it is considered the most severe complication, with a high mortality rate ranging from 10% to 41%[9,32]. The criteria for diagnosing MAS according to the 2004 guidelines are as follows: (1) Fever > 38.5 \u00b0C or lasting more than 7 d; (2) Cytopenia affecting at least two of three lineages in the peripheral blood (Hb < 90 g/L, absolute neutrophil count < 1.0 \u00d7 109/L, platelet < 100 \u00d7 109/L); (3) Splenomegaly; (4) Hypofibrinogenemia or hypertriglyceridemia; (5) Hyperferritinemia (SF \u2265 500 \u00b5g/L); (6) Hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, lymph nodes, or the spleen; (7) High levels of sIL-2r (s-CD25 \u2265 500 \u00b5g/L); and (8) Low or absent NK-cell activity. MAS can be diagnosed if five of the eight criteria are fulfilled[33]. However, the diagnosis of MAS is often delayed due to possible differential diagnoses. These include conditions that can present with similar clinical manifes-tations and laboratory abnormalities, such as systemic inflammatory response syndromes or sepsis. However, the level of SF is usually obviously higher in MAS patients and considered a highly characteristic feature of MAS by most scholars[34]. Bone marrow aspiration is considered the gold standard and is usually required in some untypical cases where there may be a diagnostic dilemma. In the present case, the patient presented a high fever with a body temperature of 38.3 \u00b0C, splenomegaly, hemopenia, hypertriglyceride, hypofibrinemia, and SF greater than 10000 \u00b5g/L. Inflammatory factors and bone marrow puncture were not examined, and the patient died. Although her body temperature did not meet the diagnostic criteria, the continued increase in SF and hypofibrinogenemia reflected worsening of the disease.\n\nDIC is also a lethal complication characterized by uninhibited activation of the coagulation system. Some reports suggest that its diagnosis can be challenging, even for some experienced clinicians[35]. A precipitous decrease in ESR in the context of persistent hyperferritinemia and worsening clinical condition may be a danger sign and raise the index of suspicion for the presence of DIC. Some specialists have suggested that anakinra may be recommended for patients with severe flares of AOSD and DIC[36,37].\n\nThe treatment of AOSD remains largely empirical, and therapeutic agents for AOSD include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate, and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Some studies have shown that NSAIDs may fail to control the symptoms of AOSD, and a large percentage of patients may afflict drug adverse reactions. According to some reports, only 15%-20% of AOSD patients respond to NSAIDs treatment, and a corticosteroid is required to control disease manifestations in most cases. Corticosteroids have been suggested as the first-line treatment for AOSD, producing a clinical response in approximately 60% of cases. Corticosteroids should be started at a dosage of 0.51 mg/kg per day, but intravenous high-dose corticosteroids may be considered if MAS and/or severe visceral involvement occur. Some cases may relapse over chronic treatment or tapering of the corticosteroid dosage[38]. High-dose corticosteroids seem to be more efficient in controlling those disease, but the maintenance of long-term corticosteroids can induce many potential adverse reactions[15,39]. In the present case, the patient developed femoral head necrosis due to long-term glucocorticoid use, and she experienced relapse due to repeated spontaneous reduction or withdrawal of the drug. Cyclosporine and methotrexate (MTX) are the most frequently administered sDMARDs in AOSD, mainly owning to their steroid-sparing effects. Other agents, such as azathioprine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, hydroxychorquine sulfate, and intravenous immunoglobulin, have also been widely applied, producing various response rates. In a study, after adding MTX, 70% of patients achieved complete remission, and 39% of patients discontinued corticosteroids. Thus, csDMARDs have been used to prevent AOSD relapse and allow for reduction of the corticosteroid dosage simultaneously[39-41]. Some researchers also have found that cyclosporine can be used in patients with severe MAS as well as AOSD[42,43]. Biologic agents or biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) targeting specific cytokines are suggested for the treatment of those cases that are refractory to csDMARDs and corticosteroids. Some studies have revealed a key role of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in disease pathogenesis, promoting the development of novel targeted therapies aimed at the optimum method of disease control[44]. It has been reported that bDMARDs are an important option for relapsed patients or as a first-line regimen, which may help to reduce the dosage in terms of glucocorticoid and other cDMARD exposure[45,46]. Some researchers have shown that most patients (84.4%) are able to achieve clinical remission initially by using bDMARDs[47]. It has also been reported that a case of glucocorticoid and cyclosporine refractory AOSD complicated by DIC was successfully managed with a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody. IL-6 inhibition can lead to a rapid response, symptomatic improvement, and corticosteroid sparing[48]. Wang et al[49] have found that anti-IL-6 antibody combined with MTX have significant therapeutic effects for refractory AOSD, is conducive to the reduction and discontinuation of prednisone, and may allow stabilization of the patient\u2019s condition after reducing the dosage of anti-IL-6 antibody, with good safety.\n\nIn this case, the patient experienced relapse of the disease due to voluntary drug withdrawal or dosage reduction several times, and her WBC and SF levels were significantly increased. Because of the frequent recurrence of the disease, the patient received anti-IL-6 antibody, and the frequency of disease recurrence was significantly reduced; glucocorticoid dosage was also reduced. The recurrence of her disease was caused by the spontaneous cessation of Actemra and leflunomide at 2 mo after surgery. Diarrhea was the main factor that caused the rapid progression of the disease. The most frequently implicated triggering factors include infections, medications, and disease flares[50]. This may induce T cell activation and proliferation with cytokine secretion (interferon-gamma and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and macrophage hyperactivation. The final result is an uncontrollable increase in IL-1, TNF\u03b1, and IL-6 production, with a severe systemic inflammatory reaction[51]. Rituximab may suppress the triggering factor effectively, but the severe AOSD flare and subsequent cytokine release required more T-cell-specific immunosuppression (i.e., cyclosporine) for effective control[52]. Furthermore, the diarrhea resulted in a large amount of fluid loss, electrolyte disturbance, and malnutrition, which aggravated the development of the disease and eventually resulted in DIC and MODS. The mortality rate of MODS patients with two-organ failure is 50%-60%, and the mortality rate of MODS patients with failure of more than four organs is 100%. In addition, a large prospective study identified an increased risk of death in patients with continued platelet depletion and poor response to treatment[53]. Our patient simultaneously developed five-organ failure, and glucocorticoid shock therapy and blood purification failed; the disease progressed violently, and the patient died before the use of cyclosporine and Actemra. In particular, attention should be paid to the signature value of the biopsychosocial model in the process of patient management, which may have great potential value, and mental health may be related to the occurrence, progression, and prognosis of the disease. The patient experienced a high fever lasting 1 mo due to bad mood. Some scholars have found the levels of ESR, CRP, and PLT in patients with rheumatoid arthritis combined with depression to be significantly higher than those in patients with no depression. Psychological intervention for rheumatoid arthritis with depression has obvious effects in improving patients' treatment compliance, as well as improving their primary symptoms and depressive state[54]. Several cross-sectional studies have revealed that those exhibiting depressive manifestations have increased levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, and CRP, which are associated with depression in patients being treated for clinical depression[55,56]. Figueiredo-Braga et al reported that anxiety and depression in lupus are influenced by a complicated mix of biological, social, and psychological factors. Their study also found that IL-6 and IL-10 correlated with increased Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression scores in depressed patients. IL-10 is responsible for helping drive the Th2-mediated response that results in increased B cell activation, immunoglobulin G class switching, and increased antibody production. It is also strongly associated with disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)[57]. Overall, the relationship between AOSD and psychology remains to be further studied.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAOSD is an exclusionary diagnosis that can be very challenging. It requires an extensive workup and multidisciplinary evaluation. Despite access to many imaging technologies and medical tests, a detailed history and good physical examination are still two powerful tools that can guide an accurate diagnosis. Importantly, more clinical studies will be useful to increase our knowledge about AOSD and complications and offer tailoring for more effective therapies. The biopsychosocial model has great potential value and should also be taken seriously.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Li HM for her technical assistance.\n\nInformed consent statement: Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report and any accompanying images. \n\nConflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest to report. \n\nCARE Checklist (2016) statement: The authors have read the CARE Checklist (2016), and the manuscript was prepared and revised according to the CARE Checklist (2016).\n\nManuscript source: Unsolicited manuscript\n\nPeer-review started: September 5, 2020\n\nFirst decision: November 20, 2020\n\nArticle in press: December 10, 2020\n\nSpecialty type: Medicine, research and experimental\n\nCountry/Territory of origin: China\n\nPeer-review report\u2019s scientific quality classification\n\nGrade A (Excellent): A\n\nGrade B (Very good): 0\n\nGrade C (Good): C\n\nGrade D (Fair): D\n\nGrade E (Poor): 0\n\nP-Reviewer: Losurdo G, Vel\u00e1zquez-Soto H S-Editor: Gao CC L-Editor: Wang TQ P-Editor: Yuan YY",

ICPIs should be used carefully in cases of immune-related disease.\n\nTEXT:\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\nA man in his 60s suffering nephrotic syndrome with IgM nephropathy seven years earlier received immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) for metastasizing pulmonary adenocarcinoma four years later. Sixty\u2010two weeks after 21 ICPI injections, adenocarcinoma vanished but nephrotic syndrome relapsed. As late\u2010onset immune\u2010related adverse events, acute pancreatitis followed and usual interstitial pneumonia exacerbated.\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) have increasingly attracted medical oncologists\u2019 attention as the target malignant diseases of ICPIs have been expanded considerably. ICPIs activate T\u2010lymphocytes to attack tumor cells, but these activated T\u2010lymphocytes may also injure normal cells. Immune activation by ICPIs provokes immunoglobulin production and excessive release of a variety of cytokines, including interleukin\u201017, 1 which may result in immune\u2010related adverse events (irAEs).\n\nIn most clinical trials of ICPIs, patients with immune\u2010related disorders were excluded from study. In fact, package leaflets of ICPIs seldom describe the disadvantage for patients with pre\u2010existing immune\u2010related disorders. The frequency of irAEs caused by ICPIs may increase particularly in patients with a poorly controlled immune\u2010related disorder or in those who manifest organ injury. 2 Reportedly, ICPIs provoked the relapse of the primary disease in 75% of patients with immune\u2010related disorder. 3\n\nIgM nephropathy manifesting as nephrotic syndrome was first described in 1978. 4 Immunofluorescence study has revealed deposition of IgM in the mesangial matrix, and ultrastructurally, the deposit shows low electron density. IgM nephropathy\u2010related nephrotic syndrome often affects adults and is commonly steroid resistant. 5 The distinction between minimal change nephrotic syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis has long been debated. 6 , 7 At present, the disease entity of IgM nephropathy remains to be established.\n\nWe report herein an autopsy case of a Japanese adult man presenting with late relapse of IgM nephropathy\u2010associated nephrotic syndrome after repeated administration of an ICPI, pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae), against pulmonary adenocarcinoma with systemic metastasis. During the late clinical course, irAEs occurred in the pancreas and lung. The mechanisms of irAEs, particularly those of late\u2010onset irAEs, are discussed from the viewpoint of pathology.\n\n2 CASE PRESENTATION\n\nA schematic representation of the complex clinical course of the present patient is displayed in Figure\u00a01. The date of hospitalization for relapsed IgM nephropathy was regarded as day X.\n\nFIGURE 1 Schematic presentation of the clinical course of the male patient aged in his 60s\n\nA Japanese man in his 60s had a history of right pyothorax, lung aspergillosis, and emphysema eight years earlier after he stopped smoking 30 cigarettes per day over the previous 40 years. One year later, he suffered deep venous thrombosis in both legs, and warfarin was administered.\n\nSoon, peripheral edema worsened, and a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome was made on the basis of urinary protein of 12\u00a0g/day, serum protein of 4.3\u00a0g/dL, and serum cholesterol of 330\u00a0mg/dL. Renal biopsy revealed IgM nephropathy with minimal mesangial cell growth and evident mesangial deposition of IgM. Electron microscopy revealed foot process effacement and mild increase of mesangial matrix with focal immune deposits having low electron density (Figure\u00a02). Prednisolone therapy was started at 50\u00a0mg/d. Although the disease was steroid\u2010resistant, the steroid was gradually tapered to avoid exacerbation of pulmonary aspergillosis. Low\u2010density lipoprotein adsorption treatment was performed seven times, and proteinuria was improved as indicated by a urinary protein\u2010creatinine (Cr) ratio of 0.2\u00a0g/gCr. Two years after the onset of nephrotic syndrome, steroid therapy was completed with the patient in delayed remission.\n\nFIGURE 2 Microscopic appearance of renal biopsy specimen (A, periodic acid\u2010Schiff reaction, B, immunofluorescence study for IgM, C, D, electron micrographs, bars: 2\u00a0\u03bcm [C] and 1\u00a0\u03bcm [D]). The glomeruli resemble those of minimal change glomerulopathy with minimal increase of mesangial cells and matrix.

Transbronchial lung biopsy disclosed the histological type as well\u2010differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography\u2010computed tomography showed multiple metastases in both upper and lower lobes of the right lung, the hilar, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, ribs, and pelvic and femoral bones (cT2aN3M1b). Molecular studies showed wild\u2010type epidermal growth factor receptor gene and negative anaplastic lymphoma\u2010kinase expression. The tumor proportion score of programmed cell death ligand\u20101 was more than 95%. Pembrolizumab injection (200\u00a0mg) was started in week X\u201063 and was continued every three weeks (for a total of 21 injections) until week X\u20102, at which time the shadow images of the primary and metastatic tumor disappeared.\n\nIn week X\u20101 (62\u00a0weeks after the initiation of the ICPI), peripheral edema reappeared, and on day X\u20102, the urinary protein\u2010creatinine ratio had increased to 16\u00a0g/gCr. On day X, the patient was hospitalized with a diagnosis of relapsed nephrotic syndrome. Pembrolizumab was discontinued, and methylprednisolone 250\u00a0mg was administered for three days, followed by prednisolone 40\u00a0mg/day, with warfarin added to prevent thrombosis. Urinary proteinuria was unchanged, so a challenge with cyclosporine 100\u00a0mg/day was initiated on day X\u00a0+\u00a010. On day X\u00a0+\u00a015, the patient complained of abdominal pain, and computed tomography revealed a 9\u2010cm\u2010sized mesenteric hematoma. The patient's prothrombin time\u2010international normalized ratio was 3.17 (standard value: 1.5\u20103.0). Prothrombin complex concentrate was administered, and the warfarin and cyclosporine were discontinued. The abdominal symptoms were gradually relieved, and on day X\u00a0+\u00a025, prednisolone was reduced to 30\u00a0mg/day and cyclosporine 50\u00a0mg was restarted together with the administration of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) compound. On day X\u00a0+\u00a030, thrombocytopenia (5.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104/mL) forced discontinuation of the cyclosporine and ST compound, after which the thrombocyte count soon recovered. On day X\u00a0+\u00a040, abdominal pain recurred, and an imaging study indicated enlargement of the mesenteric hematoma, which had become cystic and was 12\u00a0cm in size. On day X\u00a0+\u00a058, acute pancreatitis was diagnosed based on elevated serum levels of amylase at 538 U/L, AST at 406 U/L,ALT at 595 U/L, and swelling of the pancreas as revealed by computed tomography. The pancreatitis was controlled by diet fasting. After resumption of his diet on day X\u00a0+\u00a067, exacerbation of the pancreatitis recurred on day X\u00a0+\u00a074. His serum amylase level reached 1,600 U/L, and the mesenteric cystic lesion had shrunk to 6\u00a0cm in size.\n\nFever occurred on day X\u00a0+\u00a093, the mesenteric cyst had enlarged, and a chest shadow suggestive of interstitial pneumonia appeared. Infection of the mesenteric cyst was suspected, and a drainage tube was inserted. Because of the high level of amylase in the cyst fluid, a diagnosis of pancreatitis\u2010associated pseudocyst was made. On day X\u00a0+\u00a0102, complications of peripheral edema, pleural effusion, and hypoxemia developed. Despite the injection of furosemide, hypoxia progressed, and the patient died of respiratory failure on day X\u00a0+\u00a0108.\n\nFigure\u00a03 shows the profile of changing renal functions during the patient's long clinical course. Two types of renal function indicators, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine protein g/g creatinine ratio (UP g/gCr), were chosen for the presentation. The initial prednisolone administration resulted in sustained suppression of proteinuria with moderate renal function impairment (eGFR around 30\u201040) until day X.\n\nFIGURE 3 Profiles of changing renal functions throughout the patient's long clinical course.

Microscopically, there were small subcapsular clusters of sclerotic glomeruli, but the remaining glomeruli scarcely showed mesangial cell growth or matrix increase. Interstitial fibrosis was mildly noted. After prolonged protease\u20101 digestion of formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded sections, 8 , 9 mesangial deposition of IgM was shown, whereas, deposition of IgA and IgG was negative. These features were diagnostic of the relapse of IgM nephropathy (Figure\u00a04).\n\nFIGURE 4 Microscopic features of autopsy kidney (left: periodic acid\u2010Schiff reaction, right: IgM immunostaining after prolonged protease\u20101 digestion). Mesangial cell growth or increase of mesangial matrix is scarcely noted. Immunostaining after prolonged protease\u20101 digestion of formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded sections shows mesangial deposition of IgM\n\nAn encapsulated, 7\u2010cm\u2010sized hemorrhagic mesenteric cyst with a drainage tube inserted was located just adjacent to the uncinate process of the pancreas head. Hemosiderin deposition was evident in the cyst wall. Encapsulated foci of fat necrosis were scattered in the peripancreatic fat tissue, and interlobular pancreatic septa were mildly fibrotic. Acute hemorrhagic necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma was not observed. The mesenteric cyst was regarded as a pancreatitis\u2010associated lesion (pseudocyst). The pancreatic morphology is shown in Figure\u00a05. A hemorrhagic cystic lesion was also distributed on the rectovesical peritoneal fossa (Douglas\u2019 fossa).\n\nFIGURE 5 Gross appearance of mesenteric pseudocyst (a) and fat necrosis of peripancreatic tissue (b: overall appearance and c: cut surface) and microscopic features of the pancreas (d: HE staining). Old and hemorrhagic cyst of the mesentery, measuring 7\u00a0cm, is located adjacent to the uncinate part of the pancreas head. Fat necrosis is observed around the pancreas, and the cut surface displays encapsulated foci of fat necrosis. Mild interstitial fibrosis is discerned microscopically\n\nA 9\u2010mm\u2010sized, white\u2010colored subpleural lung nodule was noted in the anterior part of the right upper lobe. Microscopically, well\u2010differentiated adenocarcinoma of papillary type was predominant, but focally with a component of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Neither necrotic change nor lymphocytic infiltration was observed. The cancer cells were immunoreactive for thyroid transcription factor\u20101, napsin A, and cytokeratin 7, but negative for cytokeratin 5/6 (Figure\u00a06). Metastatic deposits were not confirmed in other organs and tissues.\n\nFIGURE 6 Pulmonary adenocarcinoma in fibrotic lung parenchyma (a: gross appearance of right upper lobe, b: HE staining, c: thyroid transcription factor\u20101 immunostaining). The 9\u2010mm white nodule is located just beneath the pleura. The surrounding lung tissue is fibrotic and honeycombed, focally resembling emphysema. Microscopically, well\u2010differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma shows neither necrosis nor lymphocytic infiltration. The nuclei of the cancer cells are diffusely immunoreactive for thyroid transcription factor\u20101\n\nGross examination of the non\u2010neoplastic lung revealed subpleural honeycombing and multifocal parenchymal infiltrative change bilaterally (Figure\u00a07). The lungs weighed 280\u00a0g (left) and 465\u00a0g (right). Microscopically, the pre\u2010existing alveolar structures were often distorted and surrounded by interstitial fibrosis, and were associated with features of diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation (Figure\u00a08). These features were consistent with acute exacerbation of usual interstitial pneumonia. The right pleura showed severe fibrous adhesion in association with a small encapsulated caseous nodule in the collapsed right middle lobe. The pleural lesion was thus regarded as old tuberculosis (see Figure\u00a07). The patient had a history of pulmonary aspergillosis, but Aspergillus infection was not identified.\n\nFIGURE 7 Gross appearance of usual interstitial pneumonia (pulmonary fibrosis) with acute exacerbation (a: left upper lobe, b: right upper and middle lobes). Focal subpleural honeycombing and infiltrative change in the lung parenchyma are noted. The right pleura shows diffuse fibrous adhesion, and an encapsulated caseous focus is noted beneath the pleura of the collapsed middle lobe (arrow)\n\nFIGURE 8 Microscopic features of usual interstitial pneumonia (pulmonary fibrosis) with acute exacerbation (HE staining, a: honeycomb lung, b: hyaline membrane formation). Interstitial fibrosis with disappearance of normal alveolar structures is observed. Hyaline membrane formation is noted at the site of acute exacerbation\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n\nThe disease entity of IgM nephropathy is controversial. IgM nephropathy may be a variant of minimal change nephrotic syndrome or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, but it occurs commonly in adults and is often steroid\u2010resistant. 5 , 6 , 7 The present patient underwent two years of steroid administration before achieving delayed remission, and a late relapse of nephrotic syndrome occurred after repeated use of an ICPI. Mesangial IgM deposition was proven by prolonged protease digestion of the formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded autopsy kidney. Antibody molecules can bind cryptic antigens after the rigorous protease digestion step, because formalin\u2010mediated cross\u2010linkage between protein networks in the tissue is significantly loosened, as has been reported previously. 8 , 9\n\nAdministration of ICPIs may provoke irAEs in a variety of organs and tissues. Early detection of irAEs and discontinuance of ICPIs are required in clinical practice. 10 Renal irAEs are infrequent at around 4%: glomerulonephritis is especially rare, but interstitial nephritis is relatively common. 11 The period from the initiation of ICPI therapies to acute renal injury ranges from 21 to 245\u00a0days (median 91\u00a0days), whereas that from its cessation to acute renal injury ranges from 7 to 63\u00a0days (median 21\u00a0days). 12 In the present case, IgM nephropathy relapsed 63\u00a0weeks after the initiation of ICPIs, as indicated in Figure\u00a03. Such a late\u2010occurring irAE is quite unusual.\n\nICPIs stimulate T\u2010lymphocytes to battle cancer cells. It is thus reasonable to suppose that the immune activation by ICPIs provoked the relapse of IgM nephropathy, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In patients with immune\u2010related disorder, 75% were accompanied by relapse/exacerbation of the disease after administration of ICPIs but with little evidence for inducing novel\u2010type irAEs. 3 In cases of malignant melanoma complicated by immune\u2010related disorders, the anti\u2010tumor effect of ICPIs was much more beneficial than the risk of relapse/exacerbation of the immune\u2010related disorders. 13 In patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer complicated by immune\u2010related disorders, 55% exhibited exacerbation of the disorders, but 74% of the irAEs were regarded as being controllable at grades 1\u20102. 14 Immunosuppressants including steroid administered to control the immune\u2010related disorder did not influence the anti\u2010tumor effect of ICPIs. 15\n\nThe irAEs tended to occur when the volume of ICPI therapy was increased, 16 and they happened within 12\u00a0weeks after the initiation of the therapy. 2 In the present case, after the late relapse of IgM nephropathy, mesenteric hematoma (hemorrhagic pseudocyst) occurred on day X\u00a0+\u00a015 and exacerbated on days X\u00a0+\u00a040 and X\u00a0+\u00a093, and the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made on day X\u00a0+\u00a058. The complication of acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis developed on day X\u00a0+\u00a093, two weeks prior to the patient's death. Acute pancreatitis was histopathologically proven at autopsy by the presence of hemorrhagic pseudocysts in the mesentery and Douglas\u2019 fossa, multifocal fat necrosis, and mild interstitial fibrosis of the pancreas. In the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation was recognized among honeycombing pulmonary fibrosis of usual interstitial pneumonia type.\n\nWhether the pancreatic and pulmonary complications in the present case were immune\u2010related could not be definitely confirmed, but the possibility of ICPI\u2010associated irAEs was strongly suspected. Acute pancreatitis is a rare complication of ICPI\u2010associated irAEs. In a previous study, increases in the serum levels of amylase and lipase were recorded in only two of 119 cases evaluated, but no associated symptomatic pancreatic lesions were present. 17 Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage are listed as ICPI\u2010related irAEs of the lung, and they are often lethal. 18 , 19 In fact, ICPI\u2010related lung lesions were encountered more often in patients with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma than in those who suffered from other types of malignancy. 20 , 21 The association of the background IgM nephropathy is supposed to be an important factor for the pulmonary irAEs, and further study and the accumulation of similar cases are needed for clarifying their pathophysiology and pathogenesis.\n\nThe remote effects of ICPIs are debatable, and the recognition or definition of irAEs may be difficult. However, the present case indicates that clinicians should be aware of the possibility of late complications of ICPI administration.\n\n5 CONCLUSION\n\nAdministration of ICPIs to cancer patients with immune\u2010related disorders has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the present case, an ICPI was adequately effective against primary and metastatic foci of adenocarcinoma of the lung. However, repeated use of the ICPI provoked a late relapse of IgM nephropathy along with late, intractable, and lethal complications in the pancreas and lung. Accumulation of similar cases will be necessary to determine the appropriate use of ICPIs in patients with immune\u2010related disorders.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThe authors do not have any conflicts of interest to declare in relation to the present report.

CAPS is characterized by widespread small-vessel occlusions that lead to multiorgan failure. In an international study of CAPS-registry patients\u2019 lupus anticoagulant, IgG anticardiolipin and IgG anti \u03b22GP Abs were the most often implicated aPL Abs in CAPS. Although affecting only 1% of patients with APS, CAPS is frequently fatal if not recognized and treated promptly.2 In spite of its clinical significance, with an approximate mortality rate of 40%, the pathophysiology remains somewhat enigmatic. Activation of the complement is required for the full clinical manifestation of APS. APS serum activates the complement in vitro, and patients with CAPS have been found to have a high rate of complement-gene mutations.3 In a descriptive analysis of 500 CAPS patients, the most common precipitating factor of CAPS was infection.4 Infections, including COVID-19, are considered trigger factors of CAPS. It could be possible that SARS-CoV2 can induce CAPS; however, no evidence has been found for this. A study of COVID-19 patients showed aPL Abs were common in critically ill patients.5 El Hasbani et al wrote a review article that discussed APL in the setting of COVID-19.6 Eculizumab inhibits the activation of complement C5, and is approved for use in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. We present a patient with a history of APS who had multiple thrombotic and bleeding episodes consistent with CAPS, likely triggered by SARS-CoV2 infection, that was successfully treated with eculizumab.\n\nCase Presentation\n\nA 64-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and triple-positive APS presented with acute encephalopathy. Her vital signs were normal on admission, with no significant physical examination findings except for altered mental status. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 131g/L, white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.8\u00d7109/L, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 1.5\u00d7109/L, platelet count of 173\u00d7109/L, and D-dimer of 0.54 \u00b5g/mL. MRI of the brain revealed chronic microvascular ischemia. Therapeutic unfractionated heparin was initiated, given her history of APS and multiple venous thrombotic events. On day 10, she developed a fever and hypoxia and tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Dexamethasone and remdesivir were initiated. Remdesivir was discontinued after 3 days, due to worsening kidney function. Subsequent laboratory testing revealed Hb concentration 86 g/L, WBC count 11\u00d7109/L, ALC 0.77\u00d7109/L, and platelet count 93\u00d7109/L. APL Ab testing revealed a positive lupus anticoagulant, cardiolipin IgG >112 U/mL, IgA >65 U/mL, \u03b22GP1 IgG >112 U/mL, and IgA >65 U/mL. Her platelet count had decreased to 67\u00d7109/L. A coagulation profile showed a prothrombin time of 23.3 seconds, international normalized ratio of 2.1, activated partial thromboplastin time of 132 seconds, fibrinogen activity of 832 mg/dL, and D-dimer of 1.56 \u00b5g/mL. On the following day, the patient developed acute respiratory distress requiring noninvasive ventilation. CT of the chest demonstrated diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity a 4.3 cm left adrenal mass, concerning in terms of adrenal hemorrhage (Figure 1). Intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 500 mg was initiated. On day 19, the patient showed a significant decrease in Hb concentration and had retroperitoneal hemorrhage on imaging. Her anticoagulation was stopped. She later had acute venous thrombosis of the right superficial femoral vein. Because of intolerance to anticoagulation, an inferior vena cava filter was placed. She developed acute right-sided weakness on day 21 of admission, and the brain MRI showed new areas of subacute watershed infarctions with areas of concern in terms of hemorrhagic conversion (Figure 2). A direct antiglobulin test was positive, serum haptoglobin concentration was low, and serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration was elevated on further evaluation of anemia and thrombocytopenia, which raised concern regarding autoimmune hemolytic anemia. With new-onset ischemic stroke, acute venous thrombosis, and adrenal hemorrhage, the patient met the criteria for CAPS. She underwent single-volume plasma exchange daily for 5 consecutive days. She also received two doses of IV rituximab 1,000 g and two doses of intravenous immunoglobulin 1 mg/kg. APL Abs and coagulation parameters were monitored every other day, and initially decreased, but later continued to increase. Because of the rise in Ab titers and limited improvement in her clinical status, she was given IV eculizumab 900 mg weekly for refractory CAPS. She received two doses of eculizumab prior to discharge, and was started on prophylactic enoxaparin. The patient did not have any recurrent thrombotic events, and her mentation and right-sided weakness had continued to improve at 1-month follow-up.Figure 1 CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast, showing large right-sided retroperitoneal mass (10\u00d711\u00d716 cm) concerning for hematoma of varying age.\n\nFigure 2 Brain MRI showing new areas representing subacute watershed infarctions with several punctate areas of acute infarction within the bilateral anterior cerebral artery/middle cerebral artery watershed territories.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCAPS is a severe manifestation of APS. It is characterized by multiple thromboses involving three or more organs, systems, or tissue types, histopathology of small-vessel occlusion in at least one organ, acuity of manifestations, and aPL Ab positivity. When all four criteria are present, a \u201cdefinite CAPS\u201d diagnosis is confirmed. With our patient, she met the criteria for CAPS. Known risk factors of CAPS include infection, surgery, malignancy, anticoagulation withdrawal, low INR, obstetric complications, drugs, and systemic lupus erythematosus flares.7\n\nCritically ill patients with COVID-19 are known to have a profound hypercoagulable state. The exact mechanism of COVID-associated thrombophilia is still being elucidated, but it is likely to have a multifactorial etiopathogenesis. Hypoxia and prolonged immobilization are important predisposing factors, but the diffuse inflammatory state and resulting \u201ccytokine storm\u201d seem to be the primary triggers.6,8 In addition, endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased levels of von Willebrand factor, systemic inflammation, activation of Toll-like receptors, a procoagulatory state, and tissue factor\u2013pathway activation are among the suggested mechanisms.6 Another possible underrecognized mechanism may be the induction of aPL Ab production in severe COVID.9 Molecular mimicry leading to anti-\u03b22GP1 Ab production has also been a proposed cause of secondary APS and CAPS. A small case series reported elevated aPL Abs in COVID-19 patients, and CAPS is associated with consistently elevated aPL Abs.6,9\u201311\n\nGiven that mortality rate in CAPS is approximately 50%, early identification and treatment is crucial. Nevertheless, due to the rarity of the disease, there have been no randomized controlled trials to guide therapy. The typical treatment approach for CAPS is multiagent therapy that includes high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange.12 Recent reports suggest that rituximab treatment may improve clinical signs and immunological profiles in CAPS management, and it is thus used in patients who have failed to respond to the standard therapy described.13 In our patient\u2019s case, despite rituximab therapy, she continued to experience rising aPL Ab levels and worsening coagulation-profile results. As such, our patient received a trial of eculizumab, to which she responded well clinically. Also, the aPL titers and coagulation parameters decreased while our patient was on eculizumab. These parameters were consistently followed on an inpatient/outpatient basis.\n\nEculizumab is a humanized monoclonal Ab approved for use in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, but has been used in the treatment of refractory CAPS.14\u201316 To our knowledge, this is the first case describing successful treatment of COVID-associated CAPS successfully treated with eculizumab. As complement activation plays a crucial role in animal models of APS thrombosis, eculizumab is considered a last resort for CAPS treatment. To date, data are restricted to eleven isolated case reports that indicated a dramatic improvement of CAPS after eculizumab. Inconsistent results with its use on clinical outcomes have been reported by Yelnik et al.17 Ongoing randomized trials are investigating the role of anti-C5 drugs in severe COVID-19; however, several case series have suggested promising effects on clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.18 Ours is the first case describing successful treatment of COVID-associated CAPS with eculizumab. The absence of further episodes of thrombosis despite stagnant aPL Ab levels in our patient treated with eculizumab highlights the potential role of complement-mediated thrombosis in CAPS.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a subset of patients with severe COVID-19, increased production of aPL Abs may play a role in the development of CAPS. Studies are needed to evaluate the presence of aPL Abs and CAPS in patients with COVID-19. SARS-CoV2 may exaggerate the clinical manifestations of APS, including activation of endothelial cells, monocytes, platelets, and complement, resulting in proinflammatory and prothrombotic states. The endothelial tropism of SARS-CoV2 may also modify the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in susceptible patients. Few studies have showen that patients with CAPS have mutations in complements, which increase complement activation. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of complement in CAPS. There have been case series reporting eculizumab use in refractory CAPS. High-quality studies like randomized control trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of eculizumab in refractory CAPS. Our case highlights the need for more research regarding the mechanism(s) by which COVID-19 may potentiate APS predisposing to CAPS and treatment of refractory CAPS with eculizumab.\n\nConsent\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient\u2019s health-care power of attorney/next of kin to have the case details and any accompanying results published.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nDelayed hepatic necrosis in a cystic fibrosis patient taking Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (Kaftrio).\n\nABSTRACT:\nThe introduction of Cystic Fibrosis Trans Regulatory modulator (CFTRm) drugs has seen a transformation in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) treatment. This has led to a significant improvement in lung function and quality of life with the potential for a real impact on life expectancy. Transient mild to moderate hepatic transaminitis is a well-known side effect of CFTRm drugs, which often improves on cessation and may not recur following the re-institution of the drug. We describe a case of transaminitis developing nine months after the initiation of Kaftrio, which progressed to liver necrosis despite stopping Kaftrio and took many months to resolve. The patient had experienced significant improvement in lung function and overall health while on Kaftrio and deteriorated when it was stopped. He was keen to restart; however, Kaftrio was not reinstated due to the potential risk of acute liver failure.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1 Introduction\n\nCystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease affecting 6,225 adults in the UK [1]. Whilst treatment traditionally consisted of supportive management focusing on nutrition, airway clearance, and respiratory infections, the introduction of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Protein Modulators (CFTRm) has revolutionized the management of CF.\n\nSince the first CFTRm drug Ivacaftor for Class III gating mutations was developed, many more people with CF are benefitting from combinations of \u201cpotentiator\u201d (Ivacaftor) and \u201ccorrector\u201d (Lumacaftor, Tezacaftor, Elexacaftor). Kaftrio, consisting of Ivacaftor, Tazcaftor and Elexacaftor, was licensed in the UK in 2020 for patients with two \u0394F508 (homozygous) mutations and subsequently a range of other mutations alone or in combination with \u0394F508. Liver dysfunction is a well-established side effect of CFTR modulators affecting up to a quarter of patients in some studies. In contrast, transaminitis with a rise of more than three times the upper limit of normal is uncommon; if present, it is transient and rarely requires cessation of treatment [3].\n\nKaftrio has been shown to lead to significant improvement in sweat chloride, lung function [1] and weight, as well as a reduction in infective exacerbations and improved quality of life. The side effects of Kaftrio include dyspnoea, bronchospasm, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rash, drug interactions and deranged liver functions (LFTs) [1], for which three monthly blood monitoring is recommended.\n\n2 Case report\n\nA 45-year-old Caucasian male with known Cystic Fibrosis (CF) (\u0394F508/Q890X) was started on Kaftrio (then known as Trikafta) in December 2019 on a compassionate use program.\n\nThe patient was pancreatic insufficient, had insulin-requiring CF-related diabetes and was chronically colonized with Pseudomonas. He had no history of CF liver disease. He was on the full range of CF treatment, including Azithromycin, fat-soluble vitamins, cetirizine, inhalers (steroids and bronchodilators), insulin and DNAase (Pulmozyme).\n\nA significant improvement was observed in FEV1 two months following the initiation of Kaftrio from 1.44 L Litres (34% of predicted) in Nov 2019 to 1.72\u00a0L (41% of predicted) in Feb 2020. He also started gaining weight, improving his BMI from 19.6 kg/m2 in Nov 2019 to 20.2 kg/m2 in Feb 2020. In addition, he felt better, had more energy, and resumed mountain biking.\n\nSeven months later, we detected early signs of deranged liver function tests (LFTs) (Fig. 1A) and repeated the measurements at six, seven, eight and nine weeks. These showed rapidly progressive and significant transaminitis. There was no abnormality of bilirubin or clotting time.Fig. 1 (A) Timeline of liver function tests (LFTs) that expands the duration of initiation to cessation of Kaftrio with the boxes represent significant events. (B) Medium power of peri-central necrosis. (C) High power of peri-central necrosis, showing hepatocytes that have died and a mixture of pigment-laden macrophages, sparse inflammatory cells, and an occasional apoptotic body. CV - central vein, arrow - apoptotic body. (D) Portal tract showing intact margin, expected primary contents (hepatic artery branch, portal vein branch and bile duct radicle), with minimal chronic inflammatory cells and peripheral ductular metaplasia.\n\nFig. 1\n\nDespite this, he was asymptomatic with no evidence of jaundice, pruritus, urine, or faecal colour changes. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities, and all physiological measurements were within the normal ranges. Kaftrio was stopped for one week at this point, with the view to restarting once LFTs improved. Unfortunately, the LFTs did not improve; however, they remained stable \u2013 ALP 139(153) U/L, AST 121(124) U/L, ALT 216(217) U/L.\n\nAs our patient was very keen to restart Kaftrio, the morning dose was restarted (no evening Kalydeko), which resulted in the worsening of transaminitis. Non-Invasive Liver Screen (NILS) and ultrasound of the liver did not show any abnormalities excluding the other causes of transaminitis, such as autoimmune or viral hepatitis (Hepatitis A, B, C, E, CMV, EBV, VZV), inflammatory or infiltrative disease. We consistently monitored clotting as a measure of liver synthetic function, and it remained within the normal range. Additionally, azithromycin, lansoprazole and nebulized levofloxacin were discontinued as these could have contributed to liver damage.\n\nFollowing normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver and essentially normal NILS screen, Kaftrio was stopped altogether due to persistent worsening of LFTs.\n\nAs the transaminitis continued to worsen, we carried out a percutaneous liver biopsy which revealed extensive confluent necrosis with loss of cells in zone 3 areas, focally verging on bridging necrosis (Fig. 1B). There was only a little inflammation associated with this. Portal tracts were relatively unaffected, with only some showing mild lymphocytic inflammation, focal lymphocyte aggregates and focal interface hepatitis. Some portal tracts had peripheral ductular metaplasia, although there was no permanent fibrosis, and the contents were present and appeared normal (Fig. 1D). In keeping with this, multiple debris-laden macrophages were present around central vein areas. No other liver disease was identified. This relatively bland form of necrosis is characteristic of, but not specific for, a drug-related injury without background changes of typical CF liver disease.\n\nOur patient had been well throughout until his Kaftrio was stopped. Whilst off the Kaftrio, he lost significant weight and lung function leading to hospital admission for intravenous antibiotics in February 2021. BMI fell back to 18.6 kg/m2 from 20.2 kg/m2 and FEV1 to 1.23L (29% predicted) from 1.72L (41% predicted). He repeatedly asked to be allowed to restart Kaftrio despite concerns of the CF team.\n\nAlthough his liver function, including AST, ALT, GGT, and ALP, normalized, a Fibroscan showed a median score of 6.6 kPa, confirming liver fibrosis. In consultation with the local liver transplant team, it was felt that he should not restart Kaftrio in case of an unpredictable reaction resulting in acute hepatic necrosis and because his respiratory status mitigated against the possibility of an acute liver transplant.\n\nWe briefly tried Ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), but the transaminitis continued to get worse, and it upset his bowels and so was stopped. We also considered starting a course of steroids and treating for drug-induced hepatitis. However, our patient was not keen to take additional medications, and LFTs began to improve without their addition. We also considered a trial of introducing each element of Kaftrio one by one, but we faced difficulty accessing Tezacaftor and Elexacaftor individually.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nKaftrio is the latest combination CFTRm therapy to be introduced in the UK. Although transaminitis has been observed in a small proportion of those taking Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (Orkambi) or Tazacaftor/Ivacaftor (Symkevi/Symdeko), it appears more common in those taking Elexacaftor which is a component of Kaftrio. In addition, a rise in bilirubin has been previously considered a pointer of severity, although our patient's bilirubin remained within the normal range throughout this episode.\n\nWe had considered the possibility of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) due to its high prevalence, but no clinical, radiological or histopathological evidence suggested this diagnosis. Moreover, the temporal association between the introduction of the drug and liver dysfunction and improvement of liver function on cessation of the drug further supported the diagnosis of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.\n\nThe pathogenesis of CFTR modulator related liver dysfunction remains unclear; however, as metabolism occurs in the CYP3A system, hepatic injury from metabolites and interactions when given in combination has been suggested [2].\n\nThere are currently no established guidelines for managing CFTR modulator-induced liver injury, with no values that can be regarded as an absolute contraindication for reintroducing the drug. As a result, due to their significant benefits in patient's overall health, re-introduction is always considered. Strategies such as short-term discontinuation or restarting on a lower dose have been shown to effectively allow liver dysfunction to settle [3,4].\n\nOur patient represents an extreme case of Kaftrio induced liver dysfunction with AST levels reaching 621U/L and ALT 983U/L (Fig. 1A), and maybe the first case of biopsy-proven hepatic necrosis without other obvious cause. Other centres (personal communication) have seen lesser transaminitis, and some are doing biopsies but none like this. Our patient concurred with our risk assessment, and sadly his CF has resumed its prior trajectory. His lung function remains stubbornly low (FEV1 less than 30% predicted), he is struggling to maintain weight and planning for a gastrostomy while being worked up for lung transplant. He can no longer ride his mountain bike.\n\n4 Learning points\n\n1. CFTRm drugs commonly cause transient and relatively minor hepatic transaminitis but may progress to hepatic necrosis and fibrosis.\n\n2. There is a need for an evidence-based protocol for stopping and reintroducing these drugs in such cases.\n\n3. Given the potential life-prolonging benefits to the CF lung, evidence-based strategies to prevent, mitigate or treat hepatocellular injury and allow continuation of those drugs is urgently needed.\n\nFunding statement\n\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\n\nContribution statement\n\nAD and FE conceived the report.

Introduction\nIn the last decades, there has been an increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFI), related to new immunosuppressive treatments and improved diagnosis with new molecular techniques and higher diagnostic yields [1,2]. We present the case of a male patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and prolonged profound neutropenia, who developed an invasive infection by Fusarium graminearum, acquired via non-cutaneous entry, presenting an atypical clinical course, gastrointestinal symptoms, sigmoid perforation and liver abscesses due to portal dissemination. The etiologic agent was identified using the 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-28S rRNA sequence gene from a liver biopsy. This is the first reported case of portal dissemination by Fusarium genus and the first report of Fusarium graminearum infection in humans.\n\n2. Ethical Considerations\nThe case we submit for publication is about a single patient who provided his verbal consent for this purpose. We do not include any details or information that could lead to patient identification\n\n3. Case Report\nMale patient, 26 years old, kitchen assistant, originated from Taxco, Guerrero and living there until he emigrated to Texas, United States, in 2016, where he was diagnosed with B lymphoblastic leukemia in January 2017. He received four cycles of unspecified chemotherapy with apparent remission of the disease and came back to Mexico (Cuernavaca, Morelos). He was admitted to the National Institute of Cancer in Mexico City in November 2017, where he was diagnosed with early relapse. From November 2017 to January 2018, he received chemotherapy for relapse with BFM like protocol (L-Asparaginase, Vincristine, Daunorubicin, and Prednisone). He did not receive any antifungal prophylaxis. On day +23 he was presented with febrile neutropenia, with no etiologic agent identified. An empirical treatment of five days of Meropenem was administered, with resulting in fever remission. He was discharged 6 days after his admission, asymptomatic but with persistent neutropenia.\n\nTwo days later, he had come back with an acute abdomen, although afebrile. Vital constants at admission were: BP: 107/78 mmHg, HR: 90 bpm, RR: 20 rpm, T \u00b0: 36.5 \u00b0C, weight: 55 Kg, height: 1.62 m, BMI: 21 Kg/m2. His blood tests showed leukocytes of 0.32 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, absolute neutrophils 0.0032 x103/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 5.7 g/dL, platelets 35 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL, creatinine 0.66 mg/dL, ALT 174 IU/L, AST 82 IU/L, ALP 1004 IU/L, GGT 572 IU/L, total bilirubin 8 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin 1.62 mg/dL, LDH 287 IU/L, albumin 1.7 mg/dL, C reactive protein 8.4 mg/dL. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy which revealed sigmoid perforation. Sigmoidectomy and colostomy were performed. The initial pathology report was diverticulum perforation. Forty-eight hours later, he presented moderate diffuse abdominal pain, and temperature > 38 \u00b0C. The blood cultures were negative. Administration of Meropenem, caspofungin and Filgastrim was empirically initiated. Contrast abdominal tomography (CT) showed diffuse liver lesions consistent with liver abscesses (Figure 1).\n\nA liver biopsy of the lesions was performed under ultrasound guidance; the aerobic, anaerobic and Sabouraud dextrose agar cultures were negative. The pathology showed granulomatous hepatitis with extensive necrosis; Grocott\u2019s stain evidenced hyaline hyphae. The histopathology of the sigmoid surgical specimen was reviewed again and then reported as transmural ischemic necrosis, acute and chronic peritonitis, and positive Grocott\u2019s stain with the same hyphae described in the liver (Figure 2).\n\nHyalohyphomycosis was concluded. The serum galactomannan was negative. Pulmonary involvement was not seen by tomography. The antifungal treatment was changed from caspofungin to intravenous Voriconazole on day 23. The patient had gradual clinical improvement the neutropenia was remitted and was discharged with a treatment of oral voriconazole 200 mg bid. He was, at that time, in complete remission of leukemia.\n\nThree weeks later he was readmitted for abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium with fever without neutropenia; he reported bad adherence to oral antifungal treatment for economic reasons. The new abdominal CT showed the persistence of liver abscesses. Exploratory laparotomy plus drainage were performed finding abscesses in segments II, IV and VI. The anaerobic culture grew Bacteroides fragilis; he completed 14 days of Metronidazole. The fungal culture was negative. The pathology report was extensive granulomatous hepatitis with necrosis and negative Grocott\u2019s stain. The patient received 2 weeks of intravenous Voriconazole plus 6 weeks of the same oral antifungal. At the end of treatment, the abdominal CT showed only one residual lesion of 16 mm. A timeline of the case is shown in Figure S1.\n\nHe did not present further complications of the infectious process. However, six months later, while undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplant evaluations, he presented a relapse of leukemia and he decided to stop the antineoplastic treatment. He died seven months later.\n\nMaterials and Methods for Identification of the Causative Agent\nA paraffin block of the first liver biopsy was requested, and DNA extraction was performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue sample using a DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Ventura, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions before preliminary removal of paraffin by extraction with xylene protocol. The molecular identification was performed by 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-25S rRNA gene amplification using a set of primers previously reported to identify fungi species (5\u2032-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTTGCGG-3\u2032) and ITS4 (5\u2032-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3\u2032). A PCR product of 500 bp was amplified, purified and sequenced in both directions; nucleotide sequence was determined with Taq FS Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Fluorescence-Based Sequencing and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA sequencing system (Foster City, CA, USA). The sequence was edited with Vector NTI program and homology search was performed in the GenBank database (nucleotide blast), finding a 100% identity with Fusarium graminearum complex strain HUT59 [3]. (Figure 3). The sequences used are shown in Supplementary Figure S2.\n\n4. Discussion\nIn the last ten years, there has been an increasing incidence of disseminated filamentous fungal infections in patients with severe immunosuppression [1,2,4]. Hematological malignancies have a risk of 6.5% for IFI [5], mainly in the induction and consolidation phases. This increase is due to severe immunosuppression conditions by myelotoxic treatments and related clinical conditions but also to new technologies such as molecular biology [6,7] that have increased the diagnosis ability.\n\nHialohifomycetes are opportunistic filamentous fungi that usually cause infection after environmental exposure [6]. Infection occurs through inhalation or skin breakdown (wounds, burns) [8]. Fusarium spp. is the second cause of infections by filamentous fungi after Aspergillus spp. More than 50 Fusarium species have been identified, but only about 12 are associated with infection in humans. F. incarnatum, F. moniliforme, F. oxysporum and F. solani usually cause allergic reactions and superficial infections such as keratitis and onychomycosis in immunocompetent hosts. In immunocompromised patients, it can cause from locally invasive diseases such as sinusitis and pneumonia, to fungemia and disseminated disease [9,10]. In neutropenic patients, it usually manifests as fever not responding to empirical antibiotics. Profound and prolonged neutropenia is the most important risk factor for dissemination and death due to fusariosis [8,11]. The most frequently isolated species in this setting are F. solani (50%) and F. oxysporum (20%) [6,8].\n\nFusarium graminearum plays a major role as the etiological agent of one important disease of small grain cereals and corn. First identified in 1884 in England, it is considered a major threat to wheat and barley [12]. The fungi, transmitted by seed, can survive up to 10 years as spores or resting structures in and on the seed. In Mexico, F. graminearum has been found in Hidalgo, Jalisco, Mexico, Michoac\u00e1n and Tlaxcala [13,14,15,16]. This fungus can produce several mycotoxins, which have shown abortive estrogenic, gastric (nausea and vomiting) and neurotoxic toxicity in swine, cattle, dogs, cats, and ducks [16,17]. Grain that has been infected with the fungus can be incorporated into basic diets and could be a source of infection in humans. So far, no infections due to F. graminareum have been reported. Considering the patient\u2019s occupation (kitchen helper) and the high corn content in the Mexican diet, we supposed that the patient was colonized with F. graminearum through the daily ingestion and handling of corn. He possibly got the mould through oral ingestion, and symptoms were gastrointestinal due to portal dissemination, which explains why we did not document any fungemia or cutaneous infection, despite an invasive disease. Usually, in disseminated fusariosis, blood cultures are positive in more than 75% of cases [6,8].\n\nIn our patient, the diagnosis of hyalohyphomycosis was first made by pathologic specimen. The biopsy revealed the presence of septate hyaline hyphae 3\u20136 \u03bcm diameter, indistinguishable from other hyalohyphomycosis such as Aspergillus, Acremonium [Cephalosporium], and Pseudallescheria [17]. Recently, the Mycotic Diseases Branch, from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, described a new entity of invasive fungal infections (IFI), which they called \u201cfoodborne IFI\u201d, in a recently published systematic review [18], foodborne IFI are infections acquired through ingestion of food or water contaminated with the fungi causing the infection. Reports describe molds and yeasts as etiologic agents. Rhizopus sp is the most frequently described mold, but one case of IFI due to Fusarium moniliforme is reported in a man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who ingested cereals. The diagnosis of foodborne IFI is difficult, clinical presentation is usually atypical, and mainly gastrointestinal. Fungi can spoil food that is ingested, and it is suggested that this category of fungal infections could be related to food insecurity. The source of the fungi should be identified to be able to classify the IFI as foodborne, which is often difficult to the ubiquitous nature of these fungi. As previously mentioned, although we suspect that our patient acquired the infection orally and this could correspond to foodborne IFI, we cannot corroborate the above because we could not have samples of the food that the patient ingested prior to his hospitalization and we did not perform stool cultures.\n\nToday, comparative identification strategies based on gene sequencing can be considered the new gold standard for the identification of fungal species. Gene sequencing is characterized by PCR amplification of the ITS region, and sequencing of the resulting amplicon (s). The ITS region can be amplified reliably for most fungi [19]. These molecular biology techniques provide better discrimination of species morphologically indistinguishable from Fusarium spp, and can be performed on different types of materials, including paraffin blocks, which is why it is considered an emerging and promising methodology to be used in the routine identification of Fusarium spp. In our case, no other fungal species were identified in the studied specimen or in any other specimen from the patient. The Fusarium graminearum complex includes 13 species; biogeographic data suggest that the majority of the species within the complex have evolutionary origins in the Southern hemisphere and Asia. According to the surveys to date, F. austroamericanum, F. meridionale, F. cortaderiae, and F. brasilicum appear to be endemic to South America; F. acaciae-mearnsii to Australia or less likely Africa; F. asiaticum, F. vorosii and F. ussurianum to Asia; F. aethiopicum to Africa; F. boothii and F. mesoamericanum to Central America; F. gerlachii to the US and F. graminearum sensu stricto (F. graminearum s.s.) it is the most cosmopolitan species and has been found in Asia, Africa, America, Europe, and Oceania [20].\n\nFinally, the treatment in localized disease can benefit from surgical debridement especially in disseminated disease together with the use of systemic antifungals. Fusarium species are relatively resistant in vitro to most antifungal agents, showing different susceptibility patterns between species. In general, most Fusarium isolates have lower inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Amphotericin B higher than Aspergillus species. F. solani and F. verticillioides are usually resistant to azoles and they have higher MIC for azoles than other Fusarium species. In contrast, F. oxysporum and F. moniliforme may be susceptible to voriconazole and posaconazole [9]. Echinocandins show the highest MIC values [21]. As far as we know there are no previous reports in the medical literature of identification of F.graminearum as a pathogen in humans; therefore antifungal therapy was initiated based on is the antifungals reported in the literature for the Fusarium species and on the clinical response.\n\n5. Conclusions\nProlonged profound neutropenia and alteration of the intestinal flora, secondary to myelotoxic chemotherapies and environmental exposure in patients with hematological neoplasms, are important risk factors for the development of invasive infections by filamentous fungi. This is the first reported case of invasive fungal infection by F. graminearum and the first case of portal dissemination of Fusarium spp. The anamnesis and exposure to environmental factors are important during clinical evaluation. F.graminearum was not identifiable by traditional methods such as culture and pathology. Access to molecular biology is extremely valuable to increase the performance of diagnostic tests in the identification of new species such as the F. graminearum reported in our paper.\n\nAcknowledgments\nTo all the infectious disease fellows who participated in the approach of this case, especially to Aaron Molina.

Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia is commonly associated with dismal prognoses, with survival rates of about 3 months. In this paper, we report on a patient with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-small cell lung carcinoma who developed severe hypercalcemia and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this metabolic complication.\nA 56-year old male with a 2-year history of Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with life-threatening hypercalcemia. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed a suspicious lung lesion. A transbronchial biopsy was performed from the upper left lobe. Due to the small size of the specimen, immunohistochemical markers were performed and revealed positive staining for cytokeratin 7 and negative for TTF-1, napsin A and p 40, which were consistent with non-small cell lung carcinoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHumoral hypercalcemia of malignancy was diagnosed.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe patient was treated with saline infusion, calcitonin, intravenous pamidronate, followed with denosumab.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe hypercalcemia was successfully treated and the patient's calcium levels returned to normal. Further evaluation revealed a non-small cell lung carcinoma as a second primary malignancy. The patient was treated with venetoclax for his refractory CLL and received chemotherapy and immunotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma. Several days after starting venetoclax, he developed Legionella pneumonia and short time after the second course of chemotherapy, a severe sepsis occurred and he passed away.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCoexistence of 2 unrelated malignancies, whichever could be a reason for hypercalcemia of malignancy is a rare event. Severe hypercalcemia, which is possible but rare feature of CLL should be a reason for further prompt evaluation.\n\nTEXT:\n1 Introduction\n\nThe estimated annual prevalence of hypercalcemia related to malignancy is 1.46% to 2.74%.[1] Generally, patients with malignancy-related hypercalcemia have clinically overt cancer and markedly elevated serum calcium levels. It is 4 times more common in stage IV cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. Solid tumors, like breast and lung cancers, and multiple myeloma are among the most common causes of cancer-induced hypercalcemia, which is generally linked to an increased circulation level of parathyroid hormone-related protein.[2] Although a minority of hypercalcemic patients may present with hypercalcemia level >13.5\u200amg/dl hematologic malignancies including lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and small cell leukemia/lymphoma can lead to resistant hypercalcemia.[2] Because of the enhancing effect of parathyroid hormone-related protein on osteoclastic bone resorption, antiresorptive therapy is a mainstay of the therapeutic approach to hypercalcemia associated with cancer.[2,3] Recently, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody to receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK) ligand, was found to be promising treatment for bisphosphonate resistant malignant hypercalcemia.[2,3,4]\n\nHere we present a patient with advanced stage CLL, diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma during evaluation for severe hypercalcemia. The coexistence of 2 different malignancies in the same patient, either of which could result in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is a challenging event. Only a very few cases of concurrent cancer-induced hypercalcemia events have been reported in the medical literature.\n\n2 Case report\n\nA 56-year old man presented to the Department of Internal Medicine with a deteriorated mental status. Laboratory tests performed in the emergency department demonstrated severe hypercalcemia at 17.95\u200amg/dl (reference range: 8.7\u201310.4), together with albumin levels of 3.2\u200ag/dl, elevated levels of phosphor 5.9\u200amg/dl (reference range: 2.5\u20135), acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.45\u200amg/dl (baseline creatinine level 0.9\u200amg/dl), urea, 73\u200amg/dl, uric acid, 12.8\u200amg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate 52\u200aml/minute, hemoglobin 11\u200amg/dl, and C-reactive protein 0.8\u200amg/dl. He was treated with an intravenous saline infusion, subcutaneous calcitonin, and intravenous glucocorticoids, followed by intravenous bisphosphonates. Due to his persistent hypercalcemia he was subsequently given 120\u200amg denosumab (Prolia). During hospitalization, there was significant improvement in his mental status concurrently with the normalization of his calcium level, which was 9.44\u200amg/dl at discharge.\n\nHis past history was remarkable for his 2016 diagnosis of Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The fluorescence in situ hybridization reaction revealed the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del (17p)) in 20% of B-cell lymphocytes. In addition, in a bone marrow biopsy, the patient was found to have unmutated IGHV gene status and ZAP 70 expression in leukemia cells.\n\nIn 09/2017 he was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine because of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Treatment with a high dose glucocorticoid was started, followed by a slow tapering down of the dose. In 12/2017 he was again admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine with left hemiparesis, dysarthria, and left facial nerve palsy. Complete right carotid occlusion was found in the CT angiography.\n\nAfter discharge, he was treated with 2 courses of a Rituximab + Bendamustine protocol with a significant decrease in lymphocytes counts. In September 2018 treatment with the second line agent Ibrutinib was started. One month later, he developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm. Six days before the present admission, the patient was hospitalized because of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with no evidence of myocardial ischemia. Ibrutinib was stopped because it was presumed to be the cause of the arrhythmia. During his present hospitalization additional laboratory tests revealed an elevated LDH level of 2250\u200aU/l (reference range: 230\u2013480), an alkaline phosphatase level of 220\u200aU/l (reference range: 30\u2013120), and low levels of PTH: 4.8\u200apg/ml (reference range: 18.4\u201381), 25 hydroxyvitamin D level of 52\u200ammol/l (reference range: 75\u2013220) with normal 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D level of 61.3\u200anmol/l (reference range: 50\u2013190), WBC 108.000 (reference range: 4.5\u201311.5\u200aK/\u03bcl), Lymphocytes 57%, PLT count of 88.000 (reference range: 150\u2013450\u200aK/\u03bcl).\n\nIn the setting of his elevated LDH level, further decrease in his PLT level to 45.000 and severe hypercalcemia, it was decided to perform a positron emission tomography/computed tomography to assess the possibility of Richter transformation. The scan revealed a 1.3\u200acm nodule with an intensive uptake of tracer in the upper left lobe of the lung and in vertebra D 7, suspicious of metastasis (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1 FDG uptake in left upper lobe on PET CT.\n\nHe underwent a bronchoscopy with a transbronchial biopsy of the lesion. Non-small cell carcinoma displaying positive CK 7 and negative to TTF-1, napsin-A, and p 40 immunostaining was diagnosed. An epidermal growth factor genotype was negative for mutations. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for ALK and ROS1 protein rearrangement as well as PDL1 expression. He underwent 1 course of chemotherapy in September 2019 that included carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembroluzumab. Results of the molecular analysis of the tumor were negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotype mutations, ALK and ROS 1 rearrangement, and PDL-1 protein expression. He then began treatment with venetoclax for his refractory CLL.\n\nTen days after starting therapy with venetoclax, he was admitted to the internal medicine department with large left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest CT revealed a large infiltrate with an air bronchogram. A subsequent urine antigen test was positive for legionella pneumonia. He completed treatment with respiratory quinolone for 21\u200adays and was returned to oncological and hematological supervision.\n\nThe patient received a second course of chemotherapy, but 4 days later he was admitted with suspected pneumonia and despite the broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, respiratory failure developed and he passed away.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nWe have presented a patient with severe life-threatening hypercalcemia that occurred a week after withdrawal of ibrutinib treatment. Ibrutinib is a novel, Bruton tyrosine kinase irreversible inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in improving survival of older CLL patients with high-risk genetics.[5] The treatment with ibrutinib may cause significant increase in atrial fibrillation events due to structural atrial disorder and impairment in calcium handling in cardiomyocytes.[5,6,7] Ibrutinib treatment has also been suggested as a risk factor for the development of Richter transformation in patients with CLL.[8] In one case report, RT was characterized by severe hypercalcemia, more aggressive course, poorer prognosis and the same molecular features as those of the pre-existent CLL.[8]\n\nThe 2 main causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer.[3] Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is responsible for 80% of cases of hypercalcemia related to malignancy and is due to an increase in parathyroid hormone-related protein secretion. The remaining 20% is related to the local destruction of bone by tumor, known as local osteolytic hypercalcemia. Less than 1% of hypercalcemia is related to elevated secretion of 1.25 hydroxyvitamin D and ectopic PTH secretion. Coexistence of cancer and PHPT should be taken into consideration if elevated or incompletely suppressed PTH levels are observed in the patient with suspected humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.[9] One study shows that about 11% of patients with hypercalcemia and malignancy had concomitant PHPT.[10] The most common type of cancers leading to hypercalcemia are squamous cell tumors, particularly squamous cell lung carcinoma.[10,11] Hematologic malignancies including nonHodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and, rarely, CLL/small cell lymphocytes lymphoma can cause hypercalcemia, making up 9% of all malignancy-related hypercalcemic disorders.[9] As a rule, PTHrP- mediated hypercalcemia is associated with a poor prognosis and a median survival of only 52\u200adays.[9] Nevertheless, patients with hematologic malignancies had substantially better outcomes with a median survival of 362\u200adays.[10] It is worth noting that no correlation was found between PTHrP or calcium levels and survival.[10]\n\nTreatment of severe hypercalcemia includes intensive hydration, calciuresis, and inhibition of osteoclast-induced bone resorption.[3,4,9,11] Intravenous bisphosphonates, preferably with the use of zoledronic acid rather than pamidronate, is the treatment of choice for increased calcium levels related to malignancy.[10,11,12,13]\n\nNevertheless, almost one third of patients with HHM did not respond to, or relapsed after, bisphosphonate treatment.[11,12]\n\nDenosumab is a monoclonal antibody reduces the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption due to blocking RANKL.[4,14] In animal models of HHM, osteoprotegerin inhibition of RANKL more effectively decreased calcium levels than zoledronic acid.[15] In a study of 31 patients with solid and hematologic malignancies diagnosed with HCM resistant to bisphosponate treatment, 64% of patients had calcium levels <11.5\u200amg/dl 10\u200adays after denosumab treatment. In this study, the estimated median response duration of treatment, both complete and partial, was 104\u200adays.[10]\n\nThe patient under discussions was known to have a high risk CLL and exhibited a HCM diagnosed on the basis of a low level of PTH, a low normal level of 25 (OH) vitamin D and 1.25 (OH) vitamin D. A non-small cell carcinoma of lung with solitary bone metastasis in vertebra D7 was discovered after extensive investigation of his severe symptomatic hypercalcemia.\n\nA small number of CLL patients with hypercalcemia related to PTHrP have been described,[16\u201321] including cases of CLL related to Richter transformation.[22,23] Interestingly, in contrast to our patient, most of these subjects relapsed with increased lymphocytes counts. Our patient developed hypercalcemia without significant elevation of his lymphocytes count but a large percentage of atypical cells were found in his blood smear. To best of our knowledge, only 1 previous report described a patient presenting with severe hypercalcemia, who was diagnosed with a coexistent renal cell carcinoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.[24]\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nAs far as we have been able to ascertain, this is only the second case of 2 different malignancies presenting in the same patient, either of which could be responsible for his developing HHM. We speculate that the coexistence of different types of tumor cells could potentiate the severity and negative effects of hypercalcemia. This case highlights the importance of close attendance to all details related to a patient's presenting illness.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to dedicate this report to the memory of our patient who battled his illness with gratitude and acceptance.\n\nWe thank Nancy Peled for the English editing of the manuscript.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nConceptualization: Shay Brikman, Guy Dori.\n\nData curation: Dafna Chap Marshak.\n\nWriting \u2013 original draft: Elena Chertok Shacham.\n\nWriting \u2013 review & editing: Avraham Ishay.\n\nAbbreviations: CLL = chronic lymphocytic leukemia, HHM = humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, PHPT = primary hyperparathyroidism, RANK ligand = receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand.\n\nHow to cite this article: Shacham EC, Marshak DC, Brikman S, Dori G, Ishay A.

ICIs are associated with development of immune-related adverse events including cardiotoxicity. We estimated the incidence of newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease in patients treated with ICIs at a large, tertiary care center.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll patients with a cancer diagnosis who received any ICI treatment in the University of Florida's Integrated Data Repository from 2011 to 2017 were included. Cardiovascular disease was defined as a new ICD diagnosis code for cardiomyopathy, heart failure, arrhythmia, heart block, pericardial disease, or myocarditis after initiation of ICI treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 102,701 patients with a diagnosis of malignancy, 424 patients received at least one ICI. Sixty-two (14.6%) patients were diagnosed with at least one new cardiovascular disease after initiation of ICI therapy. Of the 374 patients receiving one ICI, 21 (5.6%) developed heart failure. Of the 49 patients who received two ICIs sequentially, three (6.1%) developed heart failure and/or cardiomyopathy. Incident cardiovascular disease was diagnosed at a median of 63\u2009days after initial ICI exposure. One patient developed myocarditis 28\u2009days after receiving nivolumab. Mortality in ICI treated patients with a concomitant diagnosis of incident cardiovascular disease was higher compared to those who did not (66.1% vs. 41.4%, odds ratio\u2009=\u20092.77, 1.55-4.95, p\u2009=\u20090.0006).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study suggests a high incidence of newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease after the initiation of ICI therapy in a real-world clinical setting.\n\nTEXT:\nBackground\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the management of a diverse spectrum of solid and hematological malignancies previously associated with poor prognosis. Immune checkpoint blockade removes inhibitory signals of T-cell activation enabling tumor-reactive T cells to mount an effective antitumor response by overcoming regulatory mechanisms [1]. Currently, FDA-approved ICIs are inhibitors of either the cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1). Robust research efforts evaluating other checkpoint targets such as lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3) [2] and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) [3] are ongoing.\n\nICIs have been reported to cause a range of immune-related adverse events (irAE), mostly involving the skin, endocrine system, liver, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. These targeted therapies affect specific signaling pathways that can also induce cardiotoxicity. IrAEs occur due to inhibition of immune checkpoints that boost physiological barriers against autoimmunity, leading to local and systemic autoimmune responses [4]. Fulminant myocarditis is currently the most recognized irAE, but complete heart block, conduction abnormalities, pericarditis, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular dysfunction have also been reported [5\u20137]. Limited data are available on the incidence of new cardiovascular disease (CVD) after ICI initiation, and there is scarce evidence to guide prevention, surveillance, and treatment [8\u201310]. The reported incidence of ICI-related myocarditis ranges from 0.06 to 1.14% of patients receiving ICIs [11, 12]. However, absence of systematic monitoring and coding mechanisms for cardiac events in immunotherapy trials suggest that cardiac irAEs may be under-reported [9]. Accordingly, we estimated the incidence of new CVD among patients treated with ICIs using electronic health records (EHRs) at a large tertiary care center.\n\nMethods\n\nThis was an observational cohort study using data extracted from EHRs. Supported by the University of Florida (UF) Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), the UF Health Integrated Data Repository (IDR) is a large-scale database that collects and organizes information from across the UF-Health clinical and research enterprises, thereby including most inpatient and outpatient care services. The IDR provides access to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved limited datasets that include demographics, medications, lab results, diagnosis, and clinical encounters. For this study, the UF IDR was queried to extract information relevant to all patients receiving anticancer drugs from 2011 to 2017. All patients with the International Classification of Disease, ninth and tenth revisions, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM 140\u2013239.99) and (ICD-10-CM C00-D49) codes for malignancy were included.\n\nThe current study consisted of patients who had received at least one dose of any ICI including PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab), PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab), and CTLA-4 inhibitors (ipilimumab, tremelimumab). Baseline demographic information was collected at the encounter of the first ICI administration. Comorbidities such as history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease were defined based on the presence of International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes prior to the first ICI prescription date.\n\nNew CVD was defined by ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmia, pericardial disease and heart block (Supplemental Table) entered by a clinician after the initiation of the ICI without prior history of incident cardiovascular condition. The performances of these computable phenotypes were previously reported in similar EHRs. The ranges of the estimates were 79\u201395% for sensitivity, 90\u201398.9% for specificity, 70\u201394% for positive predictive value, and of 95\u201399.4% for negative predictive value, respectively [13, 14]. Patients with existing diagnosis codes for cardiomyopathy, heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmia, pericardial disease, and/or heart block before ICI initiation were considered to have pre-existing disease and were excluded from analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis: Demographic and medical history information of those with and without a diagnosis of post-ICI CVD were compared using Student\u2019s unpaired t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables as appropriate. The percentages of patients with CVD following exposure to each drug were estimated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and ICIs. Covariates with univariate p-value of <\u20090.2 were considered in the multivariable logistic regression and variables with p\u2009<\u20090.05 were retained in the model. All analyses were performed in SAS v. 9.4 (Cary, NC). This study was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board (IRB) (IRB# 201702876).\n\nResults\n\nOf 102,701 patients with a diagnosis of malignancy, 424 patients received at least one ICI and their pertinent demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table\u00a01. Overall, the median age was 63\u2009years, the majority were men (63.4%), 85.6% were non-Hispanic whites and 7.6% were non-Hispanic blacks. The most frequent cancer diagnoses were lung cancer (29.7%), melanoma (17.0%), and kidney cancer (12.7%) (Table 1). Almost half of the patients (49.5%) had hypertension, 30.2% had hyperlipidemia, 17.9% had diabetes, and 12.7% had ischemic heart disease before the initiation of ICI treatment as determined by ICD diagnosis codes. Exposures to other cancer medications are also summarized in Table 1.

However, there was a noticeable trend of higher percentages of hypertension (58.1% vs. 48.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.146), hyperlipidemia (38.7% vs. 28.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.114) and diabetes (22.6% vs. 17.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.301) in the patients who developed new CVD compared to patients who did not develop CVD after ICI treatment. The most frequently diagnosed cardiac conditions were arrhythmia (n\u2009=\u200926, 6.1%) and heart failure (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.4%) (Table 2). Of the 374 patients receiving only one ICI, 21 (5.6%) developed heart failure and 21 (5.6%) developed arrhythmia. Overall, in the patients treated with a single ICI, the rates of new CVD were the highest in those treated with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab (6/13\u2009=\u200946.15%), compared to PD-L1 inhibitors (4/21\u2009=\u200919.1%) and PD-1 inhibitors (44/340\u2009=\u200912.94%) (p\u2009=\u20090.0031). Of the 39 patients receiving two ICIs sequentially (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor + CTLA-4 inhibitor), five patients (12.8, 95% CI, 2.3\u201323.3) developed cardiomyopathy, and two patients (5.1, 95% CI, 0.0\u201312.1) developed heart failure. Eight patients (1.9%) were diagnosed with pericardial disease, and seven patients (1.7%) were diagnosed with heart block (1st to 3rd degree) after PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Ten patients received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy sequentially and one patient received three ICIs sequentially; none of these patients developed a new cardiovascular condition within the study period. New CVD was diagnosed at a median time of 63\u2009days after initial ICI exposure (interquartile range: 30\u2013175\u2009days) (Table 2). One patient developed myocarditis at day 28 after receiving nivolumab.\n\nForty-three patients including 9 (14.5%) with and 34 (9.4%) without a new CVD diagnosis had both pre-ICI treatment and post-ICI treatment transthoracic echocardiograms. The baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were 58% and 56% in the two groups, respectively. Even through there was no significant difference in the mean changes in LVEF (p\u2009=\u20090.37) in those patients with new CVD (\u2212\u20096.3%) compared to those without (\u2212\u20090.8%), there was a trend that patients who developed CVD had more reduction in LVEF.\n\nOf the 424 ICI-treated patients, 191 (45.1%) died during the study period. The median time from ICI initiation to death was 128\u2009days with interquartile range of 66\u2013277\u2009days. History of ischemic heart disease (OR: 2.11, 1.14\u20133.89, p\u2009=\u20090.017), prior use of doxorubicin (OR: 4.86, 1.31\u201318.11, p\u2009=\u20090.0184) and carboplatin use (OR: 1.86, 1.19\u20132.92, p\u2009=\u20090.0068) were also associated with higher mortality. After adjusting for the history of ischemic heart disease, and prior use of doxorubicin and carboplatin, mortality in those who developed new CVD remained higher compared to those who did not (66.1% vs. 41.4%, adjusted OR: 2.77 and 95% CI: 1.55\u20134.95, p\u2009=\u20090.0006). There was no evidence that the mortality was lower in patients treated with cardioprotective agents such as beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and statins (Table\u00a03).

The most commonly observed CVD were heart failure and arrhythmia. As suggested in previous reports [15, 16], the incidence of myocarditis was very low: only one patient (0.24%) developed myocarditis. The time to myocarditis for this patient was 28\u2009days after initiation of nivolumab, which was consistent with the reported median time to onset of 30\u2009days by Salem and colleagues [15]. This relatively low prevalence may be related to inadequate screening, particularly since the study includes data starting from 2011, when the autoimmune side effects of ICIs were just being recognized in a clinical setting. However, the observed incidence of other manifestations of CVD was higher than previously suggested [15]. Interestingly, a recent study [17] reported that compared to non ICI treated cancer control patients, cancer patients treated with ICI had increased incidence of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, which is consistent with our finding. This study also demonstrated the ICIs may lead to accelerated atherosclerosis which may help to explain some of the incident CVD seen in our study [17].\n\nEstimates of the incidence of ICI-induced cardiotoxicity vary substantially across reports. This might be explained, in part, by variations in case definitions and a specific focus on certain cardiac syndromes (e.g., myocarditis). Other case series on ICI-induced cardiotoxicity suggest that cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and conduction abnormalities are under-reported [18]. The manufacturer of both ipilimumab and nivolumab reported myocarditis (0.09%) from detailed clinical trial safety data but other cardiovascular irAEs were later described in case reports [19\u201322].\n\nSeveral studies have also characterized cardiac irAEs and their incidence. Myocarditis was one of the first recognized ICI-related AEs and has been the most studied of the ICI-related cardiotoxicities [16]. A multicenter registry including patients from the US, Canada, and Germany and found that the prevalence of myocarditis after ICI therapy was 1.14% with a median time of onset of 34\u2009days, whereas another study reported a median time of 65\u2009days from initiation of treatment [12, 23]. Pooled Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data on reported ICI-related adverse events in clinical trials suggested that the risks of cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, myocarditis, and pericardial disease were 0.53, 5.56, 0.03, and 0.7%, respectively [24]. A meta-analysis of clinical trials of PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer also reported lower cardiovascular adverse event rates (1% for cardiorespiratory arrest, 2% for heart failure, 1% for myocardial infarction, and 2% for strokes) [25]. A case series of 30 patients with ICI-related cardiotoxicity, suggested the most frequently observed cardiotoxicities were reduced LVEF, arrhythmias, and pericardial disease with almost 80% of patients having left ventricular systolic dysfunction [23]. On the other hand, patients with ICI-related myocarditis have normal LVEF in 50% of the cases [12].\n\nThe incidence of irAEs has been noted to be dose-dependent after ipilimumab and pembrolizumab with greater toxicity at higher dose levels [9]. The differences in incidence of cardiac irAEs reported may be attributable to dose of ICI and future studies should provide details on ICI dosage, number of chemotherapy cycles, and their timing. Dosing of ICIs in clinical practice follows a predominantly fixed-dosing strategy (nivolumab \u2013 240\u2009mg, pembrolizumab \u2013 200\u2009mg) and extended dosing intervals (Q2 -Q3 weeks).\n\nSeveral studies have suggested a potential role for the early initiation of cardioprotective medications including beta-blockers and angiotensin system inhibitors to prevent the development of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines and trastuzumab [26\u201328]. Beta-blockers are not a consideration for ICI-related cardiotoxicities. The standard of care for ICI irAEs and for ICI-related myocarditis is high-dose corticosteroids [10]. Interestingly, in our study we found that baseline beta-blocker use was associated with increased mortality. There is no reason to consider beta-blockers themselves problematic in patients treated with ICI, rather they likely are a marker of a sicker population with more baseline CVD and/or risk factors.\n\nThere are several limitations to our study that should be noted. First, only one patient out of 62 with newly diagnosed CVD presented with myocarditis, the commonly recognized and more serious form of ICI cardiotoxicity. Second, due to the diversity of cancer patients treated with ICI, it was very difficult to select a group of cancer patients with similar cardiovascular comorbidity as controls. Also, this is a study of retrospectively collected clinical data from ICD codes. As such we were not able to confirm these findings with direct evaluation of the electronic medical records themselves. The use of ICD code groups such as \u201carrhythmia\u201d and \u201cheart failure\u201d represent a heterogenous collection of diseases thereby impacting the interpretation of the findings. It is also important to recognize that while we excluded patients with baseline CVD, we cannot conclude from these data that new CVD is a direct result of the ICI exposure and a cardiotoxicity of therapy. Given the limited number of echocardiograms available, the lack of control group and the absence of a meaningful number of global strain studies, speculation regarding the role of diagnostic imaging in this patient population cannot be inferred from the present study. Another limitation is that there was no compliance assessment of medication use and the dose and duration of ICI use were not easily captured. We only had one patient diagnosed with ICI-related myocarditis, so we could not evaluate the effect of corticosteroids [29] or CTLA-4 agonist abatacept [30] on the outcome of myocarditis patients. Finally, while we identified increased mortality in those patients that developed CVD while on a ICI, we cannot assert this was directly related to the development of the CV disorder due to various competing risks of mortality in the population. Moreover, we are unable to establish the specific cause of death due to limitation of the dataset and this further impacts the interpretation of these findings. Finally, we also cannot rule out the possibility of selection and ascertainment biases. As such, due to these various limitations, the data presented should be considered hypothesis-generating only and not lead to definitive conclusions.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study suggests a high incidence of newly diagnosed CVD after the initiation of ICI therapy. The results of this analysis suggest that the incidence of ICI-associated cardiotoxicity may be higher than previously suggested. To better address this important knowledge gap, baseline cardiac assessment may be helpful for certain high-risk individuals (e.g., receiving combination ICI therapy, rapid decline in global longitudinal strains or a history of cardiac disease). Prospective studies are required to better characterize the incidence of specific cardiotoxicities and identify risk factors as well as long-term complications.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.

Skin affected by atopic dermatitis not only shows a high percentage of Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus colonization, but corneal barrier dysfunction is also known to occur. It is considered a risk factor for bacterial infections in various areas of the body. However, the relationship between atopic dermatitis and bacterial infection following neurological surgery has not yet been reported. Here, we present a case of atopic dermatitis in which the surgical site became infected twice and finally resolved only after the atopic dermatitis was treated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 50-year-old Japanese woman with atopic dermatitis underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping to prevent impending rupture. Postoperatively, she developed repeated epidural empyema following titanium cranioplasty. As a result of atopic dermatitis treatment with oral antiallergy medicines and external heparinoids, postoperative infection was suppressed by using an absorbable plastic plate for cranioplasty. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful for 16\u00a0months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAtopic dermatitis is likely to cause surgical-site infection in neurosurgical procedures, and the use of a metal implant could promote the development of surgical-site infection in patients with dermatitis.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with pruritus. AD patients are likely to develop bacterial infections due to frequent Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus colonization at a rate as high as 80\u2013100% [1, 2] and corneal barrier dysfunction [2, 3].\n\nPatients with AD are at a high risk of developing bacteremia [3, 4], which is considered a risk factor for surgical-site infection (SSI) in some areas of the body [6\u20139]. Previously, no relationship between AD and bacterial infection following neurosurgical procedures has been reported; however, in this study, we report the case of a 50-year-old woman with AD who developed repeated staphylococcal infections after cranioplasty. She was subsequently treated for AD, and cranioplasty was performed without a metal implant, and demonstrated a good postoperative course.\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 50-year-old Japanese woman presented to us complaining of a sudden headache. Her medical history revealed she suffered from AD, and was allergic to pollen, house dust, acetaminophen, and gabapentin. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her head was performed when the patient first presented, showing no significant results. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a right internal carotid artery\u2013anterior choroidal artery aneurysm (Fig. 1). Since impending rupture of the cerebral aneurysm was suspected, she underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping (Sugita Clip Titanium, MIZUHO Co., Tokyo, Japan) the following day, which was performed via right frontotemporal craniotomy. Titanium implants (Saney Plate system, Saney Seiko Inc., Saitama, Japan) and a pterion plate (Titanium skull mesh, Muranaka Medical Instruments Co., Osaka, Japan) were used in the cranioplasty. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 13. On POD 25, she presented with swelling of the right eyelid and fever, at which point she was treated with oral cefazolin. However, she did not respond well to the treatment and was admitted to the hospital on postoperative day 33 because of continuous fever. On physical examination, eyelid swelling associated with tenderness was observed. She had a low-grade fever of 37.0\u00a0\u00b0C and eczema of the face. Meningeal signs were negative. Pale red papules, which are characteristic of AD, were observed on the face and fissures of both ear lobes. A blood test revealed that her white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were 7300/mm3 and 7.0\u00a0mg/dL, respectively. Based on these findings, the patient was hospitalized for SSIs.Fig. 1 Three-dimensional image of cerebral angiography. Left internal carotid arterial angiography revealed a left internal carotid artery\u2013anterior choroidal arterial aneurysm\n\nNeuroradiological findings were as follows: a head CT scan (Fig. 2) revealed isodense pooling in the right frontal epidural space. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a corresponding high-intensity lesion was seen on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Fig. 3a) and on T2-weighted imaging (Fig. 3b). Epidural empyema due to SSI was suspected; therefore, she underwent emergent removal of the infected bone flap the day after admission. During surgery, pus was found in the epidural space, requiring irrigation with a high volume of saline (Fig. 4). After surgery, she was treated with intravenous meropenem at a dosage of 6\u00a0g/day. The culture revealed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus (MSSA); thus, the antibiotic regimen was changed to cefazolin at a dosage of 6\u00a0g/day. Swelling of the eyelid and fever improved immediately after surgery, and both CRP and WBC levels decreased to within the normal limits; therefore, she was discharged 15\u00a0days after bone flap removal. Five months after the first bone flap removal, the patient underwent a second cranioplasty. In this procedure, artificial bone (ARTBONE, AHEAD Laboratories, CA, USA) was fixed using titanium plates (Saney Plate system, Saney Seiko Inc., Saitama, Japan). The patient was discharged 10\u00a0days after the operation without any signs of infection. Twenty-five days after the cranioplasty, the patient presented again with fever associated with headache and swelling of the right eyelid. The implant was removed because recurrent SSI was suspected. The operative findings were similar to those observed when the bone flap was removed. The muscle and subcutaneous tissue were swollen, and it was difficult to turn the skin flap. The dural surface was covered with a dark-red hematoma and yellow granulation tissue. These areas were irrigated as extensively as possible. The pus culture revealed MSSA. Intravenous cefazolin was initiated as antibacterial treatment. At this point, the AD was not cured. We also considered metal hypersensitivity as a differential diagnosis, and subsequently, she underwent a metal patch test. The test showed negative results for the metal samples, including titanium. She was also treated with oral levocetirizine dihydrochloride, (tranilast) at a dosage of 100 mg/day (two capsules per day), and a topical heparinoid. The dermatitis and pruritus have resolved. Fourteen months after the second implant removal, the patient underwent cranioplasty. The artificial bone (ARTBONE) was placed with an absorbable plastic plate (CRANIOFIX absorbable, B-BRAUN, Hessen, Germany). She has not developed another recurrent infection over 28\u00a0months following the last cranioplasty.Fig. 2 CT of first empyema.

Pus was observed in the epidural space, while the dural surface was covered by granulation tissue\n\nDiscussion\n\nAD is likely to cause surgical-site infection (SSI) for two reasons: high colonization rate of Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus on the skin and abnormal barrier function. Generally, patients with dermatitis have a high proportion of Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus on their skin, whereas Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus is not detected in normal, healthy skin. It has been reported that the detection rate of Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus is approximately 80\u2013100% in dermatitis lesions and 75% in non-dermatitis lesions [1, 2]. The severity of dermatitis is believed to be proportional to the detection rate of Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus [1]. The barrier function of the stratum corneum is impaired by lipid reduction, and it has been demonstrated that scratching also stimulates bacteria that colonize the skin to invade the bloodstream [3, 4].\n\nIn this case, AD was suspected to be the cause of SSI because the first two cranioplasties, after which an infection developed, were performed before the AD was treated, while the cranioplasty after the AD was resolved resulted in no complications. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports suggesting a relationship between AD and intracranial infection in neurosurgery. AD is reportedly related to SSI in other surgical specialties. Aoyagi et\u00a0al. reported two cases of infectious endocarditis associated with AD, in which blood culture and skin colonization revealed Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus of the same strain [5]. There are also some reports suggesting that AD increases SSI in ophthalmic and orthopedic surgeries [8\u201312]. The authors of these reports suspect that the high incidence of Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus colonization in dermatitis is an important cause of postoperative infection. We believe that this would also increase the risk of infection after neurosurgical operations.\n\nIn general, sufficient treatment is needed to prevent postoperative infections in patients with AD, and it is necessary to plan the timing of surgery according to the condition of the skin [4]. During surgery, the dermatitis lesions must be completely drained. If they are not, the area should be washed well with povidone iodine. Blood contamination and stress due to gauze coverage may exacerbate the skin lesions. Hair washing as soon as possible may help reduce stress and prevent infection [4].\n\nAccording to a survey of 348 cases reported by Tol et\u00a0al., complications of cranioplasty include infections, which occur in 26.4% of patients, followed by convulsions (14.4%) and hematoma formation (6.9%) [13]. Other factors that could cause SSI after cranioplasty include age, hemorrhagic diseases, bifrontal cranioplasty, reoperation, long skin incision, long operation time, and thin connective tissue at the surgical site [13].\n\nIn this case, the contribution of using bioabsorbable implants instead of a titanium plate for preventing repeated infection is negligible. Metal implants may result in repeated infections. Generally, bioabsorbable plates are expected to reduce the risk of long-term infection. However, in the short term, some infections have been reported in cases using bioabsorbable implants [14, 15]. Considering that this patient had repeated infection in the short term, the effect of using bioabsorbable plate instead of titanium plate on recurrent infection may be insignificant.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe encountered a case of AD complicated by repeated epidural abscesses after cranioplasty. In this case, sufficient control of the AD resulted in a good postoperative course. Preoperative treatment of AD after neurosurgical procedures should focus on the prevention of postoperative infections.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nNot applicable.\n\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\n\nSK and NS were responsible for the concept and design of the study, performed the laboratory analysis and interpretation, and wrote the paper.

No standardized diagnostic criteria or treatment regimens currently exist.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe present study investigated the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of aGvHD following liver transplantation. Presentation, diagnosis, disease course, histology, and treatment of an aGvHD case are reported, and associated literature is reviewed. A 64-year-old female required LTx due to primary biliary cirrhosis. The donor was a 12-year-old male. Three weeks following liver transplantation, the recipient developed pyrexia, diarrhea, rashes, and antibiotic-unresponsive pancytopenia. Clinical symptoms together with laboratory investigations suggested a diagnosis of aGvHD, which was confirmed via peripheral blood fluorescent in situ hybridization. Donor XY chromosome fluorescent in situ hybridization indicating early chimerism achieved 93% sensitivity in the detection of GvHD. Existing immunosuppressants were discontinued, and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated along with antibiotics. While diarrhea resolved, the patient's general condition continued to deteriorate until demise due to multi-system organ failure at 37 d post-liver transplantation. This case illustrates the life-threatening nature of aGvHD.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHerein, we have summarized a post-LTx aGvHD case and reviewed associated literature in order to increase awareness and provide potentially risk-mitigating recommendations.\n\nTEXT:\npmcCore Tip: At present, the risk factors, pathogenesis, optimal treatment, and prognosis associated with acute graft-vs-host disease following liver transplantation are unclear. Currently, the most reliable diagnostic method is specific immunostaining for donor-specific antigens. If the donor is male and the recipient is female, fluorescent in situ hybridization-based detection of the Y chromosome is a diagnostic option. In the present case, acute graft-vs-host disease was confirmed via fluorescent in situ hybridization, demonstrating the presence of male donor DNA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAcute graft-vs-host disease (aGvHD) is one of the most dangerous complications following liver transplantation (LTx)[1]. It involves overactivation of donor helper T lymphocytes by recipient antigen-presenting cells, leading to a local inflammatory reaction against recipient tissue. Although the rate of aGvHD incidence after LTx is low (1%-2%), the mortality rate is extremely high (85%-90%)[2]. Skin rash and pyrexia are the most frequently noted early signs, followed by leukopenia. Although aGvHD was first proposed as a clinical entity in 1988, its mechanisms and optimal treatment strategies remain controversial[3]. Modification of the post-transplant treatment plan, including incorporation of more effective immunosuppressants, has a limited effect on the course of aGvHD[4,5]. In most cases, death results from overwhelming sepsis or gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a consequence of bone marrow involvement[6]. Due to the low incidence (but high mortality) of aGvHD following LTx, analysis of the present case with respect to existing literature is worthwhile in order to raise awareness regarding the condition, which may assist in the early diagnosis of suspected cases. It will also help improve diagnostic criteria and establish standardized evidence-based treatment regimens. Moreover, we wish to draw attention to the diagnostic utility of sex chromosome fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) when the donor and recipient are of different chromosomal sexes.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\n\nChief complaints\n\nThe patient was a 64-year-old female with primary biliary cirrhosis, esophageal-fundal variceal hemorrhages, and decompensated hepatocirrhosis in September 2017.\n\nHistory of present illness\n\nA 64-year-old female received a liver from an ABO-matched (A-positive) 12-year-old male cadaveric donor. The donor and recipient details are shown in Table 1. The donor was a 12-year-old male. Three weeks following liver transplantation, the recipient developed pyrexia, diarrhea, rashes, and antibiotic-unresponsive pancytopenia.\n\nTable 1 Recipient and donor demographic, clinical, and typing data\n\nRecipient\tDonor\t\t\nAge\t64\t12\t\nSex\tFemale\tMale\t\nPrimary complaint\tPBC\tHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\t\nSpecial history\tLow-dose glucocorticoids\tNA\t\nBlood group\tA\tA\t\nHLA\tNA\tNA\t\nPBC: Primary biliary cirrhosis; HLA: Human leukocyte antigen; NA: Not applicable.\n\nHistory of past illness\n\nA 64-year-old female with primary biliary cirrhosis, esophageal-fundal variceal hemorrhages, and decompensated hepatocirrhosis.\n\nPersonal and family history\n\nThe patient grew up in her locality, denies any contact with contaminated water or radiation exposure, and denies smoking and alcohol consumption.\n\nPhysical examination\n\nOn physical examination, we found her poor nutritional status, the abdomen was moderately distended with mild tenderness, and there was moderately yellow staining of the skin and mucous membranes. The rest of the physical examination revealed no abnormal findings.\n\nLaboratory examinations\n\nThe following timeline of events refers to post-operative days. On day 22, the patient developed pyrexia of unknown origin, fluctuating between 38.2 \u00b0C and 39.3 \u00b0C. On day 26, sex chromosome FISH was performed on peripheral venous blood samples. No gastrointestinal tract lesions were apparent, and no evidence of aGvHD was noted on gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsy (histologically normal esophagus, stomach, and ileum). On day 31, the presumptive diagnosis of GvHD was made based on the following clinical ground observations: Generalized maculopapular eruption (largely involving the back, neck, and face), pyrexia, pancytopenia, low blood pressure, and watery diarrhea (Figure 1 and Table 2). FISH revealed chimerism (presence of the fluorescently stained donor XY chromosome) consistent with aGvHD (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 1 Clinical ground observations of graft-vs-host disease. A: Anterior cervical rash on post-operative day 24; B: Oral ulcers on post-operative day 25; C: Dorsal rash on post-operative day 25; D and E: Palmar rash on post-operative day 22; F: Scalp rash on post-operative day 27; G: Passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day.\n\nFigure 2 Twelve erythrocytes analyzed, 11 showed an XY signal pattern, while one showed an XX signal pattern (91.7% showed one X and one Y signal, and 8.3% showed two X signals). Y is the red fluorescent signal; X is the green fluorescent signal.\n\nTable 2 Clinical manifestation and treatment timeline\n\n\tManifestations\tDrugs\t\nPO day\tTemperature (\u00b0C)\tSkin rash\tDiarrhea\tMyelosuppression\tTacrolimus (mg/d)\tMMF (g/d)\tMP\tIgG (g/d)\tAntibiotics\t\n22\t38.3\tPalm\t2\tNA\t3\t0.25\t500\t10\tYes\t\n24\t38.6\tNeck\t3\tNA\t2\t0\t500\t10\tYes\t\n26\t38.5\tFace\t6\tYes\t2\t0\t120\tNA\tYes\t\n28\t38.2\tTrunk\t7\tYes\t2\t0\t40\tNA\tYes\t\n30\t39\t> 35%\t6\tYes\t2\t0\t20\tNA\tYes\t\n32\t38.6\t> 50%\t5\tYes\t1.5\t0\t20\t10\tYes\t\n34\t38.7\t> 55%\t4\tYes\t1.5\t0\t20\t10\tNA\t\n36\tDemise\t\nPO: Post-operative; NA: Not applicable; MMF: Two oral formulations of mycophenolate mofetil; MP: Methylprednisolone; IgG: Immunoglobulin G.

No skin rash was yet apparent. The findings of detailed post-operative laboratory investigation are summarized in Table 3. Because no sample of indwelling peripheral blood from the donor prior to LTx was available, donor lymphocytes could not be identified in recipient peripheral blood using short tandem repeat sequencing or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing.\n\nTable 3 Post-operative laboratory investigation timeline\n\nPost-operative laboratory investigation timeline\t\nValue/PO day\t0\t4\t8\t12\t16\t20\t24\t26\t30\t34\t36\t\nAST (U/L)\t643\t47.6\t56\t48\t64\t75\t63\t56\t44\t52\t74\t\nALT (U/L)\t772\t88.1\t96\t86\t107.3\t62\t59\t64\t66\t71\t83\t\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dL)\t231.4\t123.5\t119.5\t76.9\t65.5\t23.7\t25.8\t24.2\t35.1\t45.6\t48.7\t\nDirect bilirubin (mg/dL)\t146.1\t63.2\t59.3\t43.2\t38.1\t13.3\t15.6\t16.5\t24.7\t28.5\t31.2\t\nLeukocyte count \u00d7 109/L\t17.5\t8.7\t12.4\t17.3\t7.2\t6.7\t1.3\t0.39\t0.24\t0.12\t0.08\t\nNeutrophil %\t93\t79\t86\t92\t81\t80\t63\t17.9\t0\t0\t0\t\nHemoglobin (g/L)\t89\t92\t176\t113\t92\t85\t75\t63\t58\t53\t47\t\nHematocrit %\t42\t46\t50\t32\t26.5\t23.3\t22\t17.6\t16.5\t15.6\t14.8\t\nPlatelets \u00d7 109/L\t21\t26\t44\t58\t77\t73\t71\t56\t47\t46\t41\t\nProthrombin time (s)\t17.9\t19.9\t16.5\t22.4\t13.5\t13.1\t12.7\t13.1\t12.8\t13.2\t13.6\t\nINR\t1.82\t1.7\t1.34\t1.98\t1.05\t1.01\t0.97\t0.99\t0.98\t1.02\t1.07\t\nSodium (mmol/L)\t147\t145\t142\t139\t136\t134\t143\t141\t138\t139\t143\t\nPotassium (mmol/L)\t3.8\t4.5\t3.1\t3.4\t3.6\t3.8\t3.9\t4.2\t4.1\t3.9\t3.7\t\nUrea (mmol/L)\t32.52\t29.8\t16.42\t4.55\t4.77\t4.46\t4.13\t3.8\t4.17\t3.74\t4.02\t\nCreatinine (\u03bcmol/L)\t89.73\t85.64\t64.59\t43.78\t58.44\t53.76\t49.19\t46.52\t27.26\t24.54\t30.45\t\nPCT (ng/mL)\t5.73\t3.86\t11.5\t5.1\t1.86\t2.65\t2.58\t2.45\t2.18\t3.65\t4.53\t\nPO: Post-operative; AST: Aspartate aminotransferase; ALT: Alanine aminotransferase; INR: International normalized ratio; PCT: Procalcitonin.\n\nImaging examinations\n\nAbdominal computed tomography and color ultrasound findings suggested laminar portal vein, inferior vena cava, hepatic artery, and hepatic venous flow (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3 The portal vein, inferior vena cava, hepatic artery, and hepatic venous blood flow were smooth.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS\n\naGvHD, primary biliary cirrhosis, esophageal-fundal variceal hemorrhages, and decompensated hepatocirrhosis.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nInitial treatment involved tapering the dosage of immunosuppressants to allow the recipient immune system to reject donor lymphocytes. Due to the inefficacy of this approach, the following treatment was administered subsequently: High-dose (500 mg/d) intravenous methylprednisolone, antibiotics, and immunoglobulin G (Table 2).\n\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\nSevere inflammation induced multi-system organ failure, which led to the patient\u2019s demise on post-operative day 37.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAt present, the risk factors, pathogenesis, optimal treatment, and prognosis associated with aGvHD following LTx are unclear. Current (incomplete) understanding of aGvHD pathogenesis may be summarized as follows. The conditioning regimen induces initial recipient tissue damage, followed by auto- and alloantigen denudation in the recipient concomitant with antigen-presenting cell activation and massive inflammatory cytokine release (a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d). If a sufficient number of donor lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, of the correct specificity are present, direct recognition of and activation by antigen-presenting cell (either locally or within secondary lymphoid tissues) results in T lymphocyte interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-2R expression. Activated T-cells then stimulate donor monocytes to produce significant levels of myeloid cytokines (e.g., IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor) and also trigger a cascade of cytotoxic signal transduction pathways, such as the perforin/granzyme B or Fas/FasL pathways (although direct cytokine-mediated injury is also possible). Finally, inflammatory infiltration in the digestive tract, skin, and bone marrow leads to severe clinical presentations[7]. In the present case, abnormally high numbers of CD8+ T lymphocytes were present during the acute phase of GvHD, while the CD4+ T lymphocyte:CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio was less than 0.1. This indicates that perhaps cytotoxic T lymphocytes (with a minor contribution by helper T lymphocytes) are the cells primarily involved in GvHD pathogenesis. In summary, the necessary conditions for the occurrence of aGvHD[8-10] include the presence of donor immunoreactive cells within graft tissue, presence of recipient tissue antigens not present in donor organ tissue, and inability of the recipient immune system to eliminate effectively donor leukocytes.\n\nTriulzi et al[9] have described the diagnostic criteria for aGvHD following LTx in the following three requirements: (1) Characteristic clinical symptoms affecting related organ systems (e.g., skin, gastrointestinal tract, and bone marrow), including rash, diarrhea, and pancytopenia, among others; (2) Abnormal skin or digestive tract histology; and (3) HLA or DNA evidence of donor immunoreactive lymphocytes in involved organs or peripheral blood of the recipient. In addition to the above criteria, T lymphocyte counts and cytokine quantitation provide clear diagnostic support. Currently, the most reliable diagnostic method is specific immunostaining for donor-specific antigens. If the donor is male and the recipient is female, FISH-based detection of the Y chromosome is a diagnostic option[9,11,12]. At present, no false negatives have been reported for this method. In the present case, aGvHD was confirmed via FISH, demonstrating the presence of male donor DNA.\n\nDue to inter-individual differences in post-operative GvHD pathogenesis and presentation, no unified treatment plan exists. Each hospital follows a unique treatment plan associated with unique advantages and disadvantages. A commonality across most centers is reduction of the tacrolimus dose, cessation of anti-metabolic immunosuppressants, decreasing the steroid dose, and administering antilymphocyte globulin[13-15]. Successful treatment via increasing immunosuppressant dosages has also been reported, with recommendations for cessation of all immunosuppressants in favor of isolated anti-human thymocyte globulin treatment[16]. Certain patients also exhibit drug resistance or even resistance to the effects of some hormones[17]. Treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 or anti-IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies may prove beneficial[18,19]. Currently, corticosteroids are the best-recognized first-line treatment agents for GvHD. Glucocorticoids exert efficient anti-inflammatory effects and can induce donor lymphocyte apoptosis. High-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy is administered during the acute phase of GvHD. It can inhibit inflammatory cell activation, thereby blocking the inflammatory cytokine cascade to improve systemic signs and symptoms. In cases of observation of GvHD symptoms (gastrointestinal disturbance, immunodeficiency despite overzealous inflammation, and deficient coagulation), hydration, electrolyte and acid-base rebalancing, nutritional support, restoration of gastrointestinal mucosal integrity, correction of microfloral imbalance, and transfusion of plasma and platelets can help mitigate poor outcomes, including severe infection[13,20].\n\nIn order to lessen mortality resulting from aGvHD, early detection and optimal standardized treatment are paramount. Additionally, an improved understanding of pathogenesis may assist in the prevention and treatment of this disorder. Based on our experience and the literature review, we make the following recommendations: Baseline (presurgical) donor and recipient blood samples should be obtained and cryopreserved. High-risk patients should routinely undergo HLA typing as a preliminary risk evaluation step. Ideally, the age difference between matched donors and recipients should not exceed 20 years. Pre-existing use of oral immunosuppressants should be minimized or discontinued prior to transplantation wherever possible. During perfusion of the donor abdominal aorta and portal vein, the effluent should run clear and the liver texture should soften. Finally, minimizing blood product infusion may lessen the rate of complications[15].\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the present case, aGvHD was confirmed via FISH, demonstrating the presence of male donor DNA.

High-dose corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment of NMOSD; however, these may cause reactivation of viral replication in patients with stable HBV which may lead to liver damage. Therefore, care should be placed in corticosteroid use in patients with NMOSD and HBV infection.\nHerein, we report the case of a 31-year-old woman with NMOSD and HBV infection who was seropositive for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody. The stable and HBV carrier status of the patient led to the deferment of antiviral and hepatoprotective agents in early treatment. However, liver function impairment was detected during follow-up, with an improvement in the best-corrected visual acuity.\nThe patient was diagnosed with NMOSD with active replication of HBV and seropositive anti-aquaporin-4 antibody considering the medical history and ancillary examinations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo manage NMOSD, intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone (20\u200amg/kg\u200ad) was administered for 5 days which was gradually tapered to oral steroids. However, liver function impairment was observed during follow-up; therefore, anti-HBV drugs (entecavir) and hepatoprotective drugs (bicyclol or polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine) were administered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA marked improvement was observed in the patient's best-corrected visual acuity after 4\u200aweeks of treatment. However, follow-up examinations revealed liver function damage which necessitated administration of antiviral and hepatoprotective drugs. Liver function normalized after 1\u200amonth.\nThis case underscores the importance of preventive treatment of liver protection in patients with HBV infection prior to or simultaneous with glucocorticoid therapy and furthermore, there is an urgent need to develop authoritative guidelines regulating corticosteroid use in the treatment of patients with HBV infection.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1 Introduction\n\nNeuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an acute or subacute demyelinating inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), traditionally understood to be confined to the optic nerve and spinal cord. However, there is a group of demyelinating diseases with a limited form that do not meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for NMO. Similar pathogenesis and clinical characteristics are observed between this group and NMO, including single or recurrent optic neuritis (ON) and longitudendelitis extensive transverse myelitis, ON or longitudendelitis extensive transverse myelitis with rheumatoid immune disease, and positive rheumatoid immune-related autoimmune antibodies. In 2007, Wingerchuk et al[1] named this group of diseases as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, previous research has found no significant difference regarding the biological characteristics and treatment strategies between NMO and NMOSD; furthermore, patients with NMOSD eventually develop NMO. In June 2015, the International Panel for NMO Diagnosis revised the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for NMO; particularly, they removed the separate definition of NMO and included NMO in the broader category of NMOSD.[2]\n\nChronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is a global health problem. In 2009, more than 2 billion people have been infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) worldwide.[3] In China, the infection rate of HBV is higher, and approximately 20% of patients with HBV infection exhibit extrahepatic manifestations.[4] HBV infection and vaccination are associated with CNS demyelinating diseases, such as ON, transverse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and multiple sclerosis.[5\u20138] Furthermore, previous studies in the US have investigated the incidence of NMOSD postHBV vaccination.[9] Zhao et al[7] found that patients with NMOSD and concomitant CHB infection exhibited severe manifestations. Liu et al[5] analyzed the clinical features of 10 Chinese patients with NMOSD combined with CHB infection who were seropositive for aquaporin-4; they explained the possible pathologic mechanism between the association of NMOSD and HBV infection. However, the role of HBV infection in the emergence of NMOSD was not specified, and no recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with NMOSD and HBV infection were outlined.\n\nHere, we report a case of NMOSD with CHB infection who was seropositive for aquaporin-4-antibodies.\n\n2 Case presentation\n\n2.1 Patient information\n\nIn November 14, 2020, a 31-year-old woman consulted our hospital due to acute vision loss of the right eye for 1 week. This was associated with lightening of the visual object and painful eye rotation for 1 week. One week prior to admission, the visual color above the nose of the right eye turned white; however, no triggering factors were identified. Upon admission, visual field examination was performed which revealed \u201cpartial visual defect of the right eye\u201d (Fig. 1). She experienced rapid decrease in her right eye visual acuity, which progressed to \u201chand motion\u201d 1 day before admission. One year prior to consultation, she was diagnosed as an asymptomatic HBV carrier and received no treatment. However, further probing of past medical history was unremarkable for other comorbid diseases. She denies history of trauma and surgery. Furthermore, she is allergic to mango and ultraviolet light. She had a regular routine, and denies history of tobacco and alcohol use. Her family history was unremarkable.\n\nFigure 1 Visual field examination of right eye upon admission showed a defect of upper visual field in the right eye.\n\n2.2 Clinical findings\n\nAfter admission, the visual acuity of the right eye was hand motion (\u201311.00/\u20132.50\u2217150\u200a=\u200ano improvement), and the left eye was 0.08 (\u201314.00/\u20133.50\u2217175\u200a=\u200a0.8). The intra-ocular pressure of both eyes were 19\u200amm\u200aHg. The pupil diameter of the right and left eye were approximately 5 and 3\u200amm, respectively. Additionally, the penlight examination of the right eye revealed absence of the direct light pupillary reflex, presence of the indirect light pupillary reflex, and positive RAPD; on the other hand, the indirect and direct light pupillary reflex of the right eye were both present. Upon fundoscopic examination, the optic disc boundary of both eyes was clear with a light red color; furthermore, no reflection was observed in the fovea of the macula.\n\n2.3 Diagnostic assessment\n\nThe flash visual evoked potential showed a delay in the P2 peak time and decrease in the P2 wave amplitude of the right eye compared with the left eye. Results from the optical disc optical coherence tomography, electrocardiogram, chest radiography, spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), routine complete blood count, urinalysis, coagulation studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, anti-nuclear antibody spectrum 17 items, treponema pallidum specific antibody, and liver and kidney function tests were unremarkable. Furthermore, HBV profile revealed (+) HBsAg, (+) HBeAg (+), (\u2013) HBeAb, (+) HBcAb-IgG, (\u2013) HCV-Ab, (\u2013) HCV-Ag, and (+) PreS1-Ag. Antibodies against demyelinating diseases of the CNS revealed seropositive anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab). Computer visual field: defect of the upper visual field of the right eye (Fig. 1). MRI scans of the brain showed a long T2 signal in the intra-orbital segment of the right optic nerve, consistent with ON. The patient was diagnosed with the following conditions considering the medical history, and physical and ancillary examinations:\n\n1. NMOSD,\n\n2. binocular ametropia,\n\n3. stage of active HBV replication.\n\n2.4 Therapeutic intervention\n\nDuring the first week, intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone (20\u200amg/kg\u200ad) was administered for 5 days with drugs that nourish the nerve and reduce adverse hormone effects; the methylprednisolone were tapered to oral prednisone tablets therapy (1\u200amg/kg\u200ad) after 5days. She remained in the hospital for 10\u200adays. Prior to discharge, improvements were observed in the patient's visual acuity, color vision, and right eye shapes and details. Particularly, the visual acuity of the right eye was \u201cfinger count\u201d/30\u200acm (\u201311.00/\u20132.50\u2217150\u200a=\u200ano improvement), and the left was 0.08 (\u201314.00/3.50\u2217175\u200a=\u200a4.9).\n\n2.5 Follow-up and outcomes\n\nFollowing discharge, the patient was maintained on oral prednisone tablets therapy whose dosage was gradually reduced by 5\u200amg every 2\u200aweeks. This was administered with adjuvant drugs to nourish the nerve and reduce adverse hormone reactions. On December 14, 2020, patient was followed up. During this consult, visual examination revealed best-corrected visual acuity of the right and left eyes as 0.1 and 0.8, respectively. A visual field examination is shown in Figure 2. Her second follow-up was on January 4, 2021 which revealed best-corrected visual acuity of the right and left eye as 0.12 and 0.8, respectively.\n\nFigure 2 Visual field examination of right eye at first review showed that the area of visual field defect in the right eye was slightly improved compared with that at admission.\n\nOn February 21, 2021, the patient felt limited visual field and unsatisfactory improvement of the right eye; therefore, she was admitted in the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army for 7\u200adays. On admission, the visual acuity of right eye was 0.04 (\u201314.5/\u20132.50\u2217180\u200a=\u200a0.6), while that of the left eye was 0.08 (\u201314.50/2.50\u2217175\u200a=\u200a0.8). Additionally, upon analysis, cerebrospinal fluid and blood were reactive for HBsAg, HBeAg, and core antibodies; furthermore, quantitative determination of HBV DNA was 8.44\u200a\u00d7\u200a107\u200acopies/mL. T-cell analysis was performed for tuberculosis infection, which revealed antigen A (\u2013), antigen B (\u2013), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (\u2013), and HLA-B27(\u2013). Furthermore, liver function tests revealed that alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 287.5\u200aU/L and 272.1\u200aU/L, respectively. The patient received a reduced dose of oral prednisone tablets therapy (20\u200amg/d) combined with adjuvant drugs to improve microcirculation, nourish nerve, anti-HBV drugs (entecavir 0.5\u200amg/d), and hepatoprotective drugs (bicyclol 25\u200amg tid, or polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine 228\u200amg tid). Once the patient's condition was stable, she was discharged. On March 22, 2021, 1 month after discharge, her liver function tests and HBV DNA quantification were re-evaluated. The results revealed alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase of 20.4\u200aU/L and 80.3\u200aU/L respectively, indicating a return to normal for the patient's liver function. Quantitative determination of HBV DNA revealed 1.46\u200a\u00d7\u200a103\u200acopies/mL, indicating a significant decrease in the HBV replication activity.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nNMOSD is a group of inflammatory demyelinating diseases mediated by antigens and antibodies of the humoral immunity which affects the CNS. AQP4 is a protein located in the cell membrane of neurons, such as astrocytes. The international consensus for NMOSD diagnosis revised in 2015 proposed to divide NMOSD into NMOSD with or without AQP4-IgG.[2] For patients with AQP4-IgG, only 1 of the following core clinical features is required to be diagnosed with NMOSD. These core clinical features include clinical syndromes or MRI findings related to spinal cord, optic nerve, area postrema, other brainstem, cerebral, or diencephalic presentations. The detection of AQP4-Ab is 99% specific to NMO disease; a seropositive AQP4-Ab is needed to establish a diagnosis of NMO or NMOSD, which was observed in our patient. ON is an inflammatory lesion of the optic nerve caused by various causes,[10] According to etiology, it can be classified as idiopathic, autoimmune, infectious, or unclassified ON. Notably, precursors of viral infections may induce factors causing idiopathic ON. Furthermore, infection-related ON can lead to autoimmune disorders when the infection triggers whole-body or local inflammatory response of the optic nerve; therefore, overlaps may be observed between idiopathic and infectious ON in some classifications. In 2014, Toosy et al[10] proposed the concept of typical and atypical ON according to the relationship of ON to either multiple sclerosis or demyelinating disease of the CNS. Zhao et al[7] showed that 92.3% of patients with ON and HBV infection were atypical. Our patient reported no history of autoimmune diseases and infection or close contact, except for being diagnosed as an HBV carrier. Additionally, anti-nuclear antibody spectrum test results were unremarkable. Therefore, differential diagnosis between infectious ON and connective tissue disease-induced optic neuropathy. The patient lived their life routinely and reported no history of smoking, alcohol drinking, or gastrointestinal disease; these factors exclude the diagnosis of toxic and malnourished metabolic optic neuropathy. The brain MRI findings results suggest that only the right optic nerve signal was abnormal; therefore, visual acuity loss caused by compression of intra-cranial tumor or sinus inflammation involving the optic nerve could be ruled out. In addition, the young age of the patient, and the presentation of decreased vision with ocular rotation pain and unremarkable fundoscopic examination rule out Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Therefore, it was considered that the disease was caused by HBV infection, resulting in autoimmune dysfunction which caused ON symptoms.\n\nIt has been reported that HBV infection may aggravate ON.[7] Furthermore, a confirmation of a patient's HBV infection or vaccination status and the presence of clinical manifestations that meet the NMOSD diagnostic criteria are required to establish a diagnosis of HBV-associated NMOSD. In our patient, HBeAg was positive, and quantitative determination of HBV DNA was 8.44\u200a\u00d7\u200a107\u200acopies/mL, indicating active HBV replication. Furthermore, her AQP4-Ab IgG level was serologically positive. Therefore, the diagnosis of HBV-associated NMOSD was confirmed after exclusion of other infectious factors. Liu et al[5] speculated that the molecular simulation and immune cross-reaction between HBsAg and myelin antigen of the CNS may potentially explain the primary pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying NMOSD with HBV infection. Molecular simulation of T cell infective factors has been suggested as a potential mechanism of demyelination of the CNS after HBV vaccination.\n\nAt treatment initiation, the patient was only an HBV carrier with normal liver functions; therefore, antiviral and hepatoprotective medications were not administered; however, continuous glucocorticoid administration for 2\u200amonths led to liver damage. To address this, the steroid dose was gradually tapered while administering antiviral and hepatoprotective medications. After 1\u200amonth, liver function gradually returned to normal and HBV replication was controlled. An increased risk of hepatitis flare is observed in patients with CHB undergoing glucocorticoid therapy even if administered as short-term and high dose; therefore, researchers suggest the effectiveness of prophylactic antiviral therapy in patients receiving high-dose glucocorticoids regardless of duration.[11] Curras-Martin et al[12] reported a 46-year-old African-American man with a history of untreated HBV infection, who presented with blurred vision; he was diagnosed with ON with chronic or acute HB infection, twice. The first treatment was a combination of hormonal and antiviral therapy. The second treatment was considered to be viral hepatitis flare; therefore, steroids were avoided and only antiviral medication was administered. In both treatments, the patient's visual acuity improved after a few days; furthermore, in the second treatment, after 5\u200adays of treatment with antiviral drugs, a rapid recovery of the liver function and gradual reduction of symptoms of systemic discomfort were observed. Liu et al.[5] retrospectively analyzed 10 patients with NMOSD with CHB infection who were seropositive for AQP4-Ab; they found an increased risk of liver damage in these patients after high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, they suggested that patients with NMOSD should be aware of the possibility of HBV infection once liver damage occurs, which would necessitate adjustments to treatment. Teng et al[13] reported a case of hepatitis B-related optic neuritis that was treated with therapeutic plasma exchange. This finding demonstrated the correlation between hepatitis B-related optic neuritis and immunopathogenesis, which presents an alternative treatment for hormone-invalid and disabled ON.\n\nHowever, a standardized guideline of treatment of patients with HBV and NMOSD remains uncreated. Furthermore, conflicts regarding the medication remain for patients with hepatitis B complicated with NMOSD. These conflicts are attributed to the liver damage caused by high-dose glucocorticoids in patients with HBV despite it being the routine treatment of patients with NMOSD. This case report suggests the importance of glucocorticoid therapy with antiviral drugs in the management of asymptomatic HBV carriers.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nJiaying Lei presented the idea, learned about optic neuritis, hepatitis B virus, and immune complex disease, she also wrote the manuscript.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nThe Clinical and Pathological Features of Children With Microscopic Polyangiitis.\n\nABSTRACT:\nObjective: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical features, pathological characteristics, and the prognosis of children with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Methods: Ten children with MPA that were hospitalized in our hospital were included in this study. The children's pre-diagnosis status, clinical manifestations, renal pathology, treatment, and prognosis data were analyzed retrospectively. Results: All 10 cases included female patients with a median age of 8.9 years old at the time of diagnosis. MPO-ANCA antibody was positive in all cases, combined with a positive anti-GBM antibody in two cases. Nine cases had primary AAV and one had antithyroid drug (ATD)-associated MPA (secondary to methimazole). Renal involvement was found in all 10 patients, lung impairment was present in eight cases, and anemia was present in nine patients. Renal biopsies were performed in all 10 patients. Segmental focal or global glomerular necrosis was observed in 70% of the patients (7/10). The treatment mainly included steroid use combined with Cyclophosphamide and Mycophenolate. The follow-up s of the patients revealed normal renal function in eight patients and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in two patients. Conclusions: Female predisposition and positive MPO-ANCA antibody were prominent in children with MPA. The patients' kidneys and lungs were the most frequently involved organs. Corticosteroid combined with immunosuppressive therapy was recommended for the treatment of MPA. Early diagnosis, prompt aggressive treatment, and regular follow-ups are also very important factors associated with a good prognosis.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nMicroscopic polyangiitis (MPA) belongs to the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV). AAV is the necrotizing inflammation of the small and medium vessels and is characterized by anti-neutrophil cytoplasm autoantibody related to a group of diseases. It is also a kind of systemic vasculitis involved with the small vein, mall artery, and blood capillary. MPA typically exhibits multiple organ involvement including the patients' kidneys and lungs, which are the most commonly affected organs. MPA is also considered to occur mostly in adults and rarely in children. Previous reports have shown that AAV disease types are significantly different in different regions and races; GPA was mainly seen in Nordic and British Caucasian AAV patients. However, in southern Europe, Japan, and China, MPA is dominant. This is especially found in China where MPA patients account for the majority (80%) (1). Contrary to adults, female children with AAV have a higher incidence rate than males and their clinical manifestations and treatment programs are similar to adults, but the long-term prognosis is better than in adults (2). Children with MPA are also more likely to be females and the prevalence reaches a peak in early puberty (3, 4). In 2016, it was described in the EMA (the European Medicines Agency) standard of the AR Chi Ve investigation network that among the largest pediatric MPA cohort to date (48 patients), females accounted for 73% of the patients and had an average age of 10.8 years old (5). From 2003 to 2013, the first affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University diagnosed 20 children with MPA without GPA or EGPA, with a male to female ratio of 4:12 and an average age of 8.9 years old (6).\n\nIn this study, the clinical characteristics and pathological features of pediatric patients with MPA were retrospectively analyzed in order to explore the clinical features, pathological characteristics, and the prognosis of children with MPA.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThe Selection of Patients\n\nTen female pediatric patients with MPA, aged \u2264 14 years and diagnosed in Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University between January 2000 and December 2018 were enrolled in this study. Their clinical and pathology data were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with MPA who had received the Antithyroid Drug (ATD) were defined as ATD-associated MPA and the other patients were defined as primary MPA (7). The diagnosis of primary MPA was based on the 2012 revised Chapel Hill Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides (8). All patients were treated according to the same protocol.\n\nThe current study was approved by the ethical committee of our hospital and all patients' legal guardians signed written informed consent.\n\nThe General Data of the Patients\n\nRenal pathology was performed in all 10 cases and repeated renal biopsy was performed in one case after 2-year treatment.\n\nDisease activity was scored according to the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS).\n\nThe ANCA Analysis\n\nSerum samples of the patients were screened for ANCA by antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for PR3 or MPO. Serum samples of the patients were screened for PR3-ANCA, MPO-ANCA, anti-GBM and anti-dsDNA by antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum ANA levels were tested by Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay. Serum levels of CRP, C3 and C4 were measured by immune turbidimetry. The changes of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were determined by Westergren method.\n\nRenal Pathology\n\nA renal biopsy was performed on all 10 patients. The renal biopsy specimens were examined by both immunofluorescence and light microscopy and electron microscopy. The immune complex deposition was defined as a score of 0 to 4+ in staining for any kind of immunoglobulins (Igs) observed by immunofluorescence microscopy and/or electron-dense deposits observed by electron microscopy. All patients biopsied after the same amount of disease duration.\n\nTreatment Protocols\n\nThe induction therapy consisted of Prednisone (1\u20132 mg/kg per day) plus Cyclophosphamide (CTX, 8\u201312 mg/kg per day, 2 days, once every 2 weeks, the cumulative dosage <150mg/kg). Patients with severe necrotizing crescentic glomerular nephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage were also treated with Methylprednisone (MP, 7.5\u201315 mg/kg per day, 3 days) pulse therapy. For maintenance therapy, low doses of Prednisone combined with immunosuppressive drugs such as CTX and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) were administered.\n\nTreatment Response\n\nComplete remission (CR) is defined as (9): (1) The normalization of renal function if renal insufficiency is present; and (2) The disappearance of hematuria, proteinuria, and extra renal manifestations of systemic vasculitis.\n\nPartial remission (PR) is defined as (9): (1) The stabilization or improvement of renal function if renal insufficiency is present; (2) Dialysis independent if renal failure is present; and (3) The resolution of hematuria and proteinuria and/or the resolution of extra renal manifestations of systemic vasculitis.\n\nTreatment failure is defined as (9): (1) The progressive decline in renal function with persistent active urine sediments or; (2) Persistence or the new appearance of any extra-renal manifestations of vasculitis or; (3) Death.\n\nResults\n\nThe Clinical and Renal Pathological Features\n\nAll 10 patients were female and were diagnosed at the age of 5\u201313 years old, with a median age of 8.9 years old. As shown in Table 1, all 10 patients had extra renal involvement manifestations: 90% of the patients (9/10) had moderate to severe anemia. Eighty percentage of the patients (8/10) had respiratory tract symptoms, such as cough or hemoptysis, abnormal pulmonary X-ray or CT examination, presenting a patchy, nodular grainy image, localized emphysema or increased and blurred lung texture. A rash that was presented as purpura was found in 20% of the patients (2/10). Renal involvement with hematuria and proteinuria was observed in all 10 children. Gross hematuria was seen in 30% of the patients (3/10). Seventy percentage of the patients (7/10) showed mild to moderate proteinuria and 30% of the patients (3/10) showed nephrotic proteinuria. Impaired renal function was seen in 60% of the patients (6/10). Only one patient had Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Other patients have no other diseases. None of them have a family history of autoimmune diseases. Nine of the 10 cases were diagnosed as primary AAV. The other 1 case included a history of hyperthyroidism and received a Methiomidazole administration and was diagnosed as ATD-associated MPA (case 9). The time from onset (time provided by the chief complaint) to diagnosis ranged from 1 week to 3 years, with an average of 4.5 months (Table 1).\n\nTable 1 Summary of clinical features of 10 children with MPA.\n\nPatient\tGender\tAge, yrs\tDisease course, mos\tOrgan involvement\tExtrarenal involvement\tPulmonary X-ray or CT\tRenal involvement\tGFR at Diagnosis\tBVAS\tImmunosuppressive Therapy\tTime of follow-up, yrs\tPrognosis\t\n1\tF\t5\t36\tLung, Kidney\tFever, weakness, weight loss, lung damage, anemia\tMultiple patchy glass grinding\tGross hematuria, massive proteinuria\t9.66\t19\tMPP\t5.4\tESRD\t\n2\tF\t13\t1\tGstro-intestinal, Kidney\tFever, weakness, weight loss, abdominalgi, vomiting, anemia\t\u2013\tHematuria, mild proteinuria\t39\t18\tMPP+MMF\t5.5\tMild proteinuria, PR\t\n3\tF\t9\t3\tSkin, Lung, Kidney\tPurpura, analgesia, lung damage, anemia\tMultiple patchy glass grinding\tHematuria, mild proteinuria\t63\t19\tMPP+CTX+MMF\t5.2\tMicroscopic hematuria, PR\t\n4\tF\t9\t0.25\tLung, Kidney\tAbdominalgi, headache, anemia\tDouble lung texture increased blur\tGross hematuria, massive proteinuria\t5.3\t16\tHD+MPP+CTX+LEF+MMF\t9\tMild proteinuria, PR\t\n5\tF\t10\t0.75\tLung, Kidney\tLung damage, anemia\tPatches, nodules, ground glass\tHematuria, moderate proteinuria\t72.5\t23\tPE+MPP+CTX+MMF\t2.8\tMicroscopic hematuria, PR\t\n6\tF\t6\t1\tLung, Kidney\tLung damage, anemia\tGround glass, localized emphysema\tGross hematuria, moderate proteinuria\t143\t16\tMPP\t2\tCR\t\n7\tF\t6\t1\tSkin, Lung, Kidney\tRash, oral ulcer, lung damage, anemia\t\u2013\tHematuria, mild proteinuria\t120\t20\tMPP+MMF\t2\tMicroscopic hematuria, PR\t\n8\tF\t12\t1\tLung, Kidney\tAbdominalgi, lung damage\tPatchy density\thematuria\t154\t21\tPRED+MMF\t0.5\tCR\t\n9\tF\t13\t0.75\tLung, Kidney\theadache, oral ulcer, lungdamage, anemia\tPatchy high density shadow\tHematuria, mild proteinuria\t142\t13\tMPP+MMF\t0.3\tMild proteinuria, Microscopic hematuria, PR\t\n10\tF\t6\t0.75\tLung, Kidney\tAbdominalgi, lung damage, anemia\tPatchy ground glass\tHematuria, massive proteinuria\t5.3\t22\tMPP+CTX\t4.3\tESRD\t\nBVAS, birmingham vasculitis activity score (at time of diagnosis); HD, hemodialysis; PE, plasma exchange; PRED, prednisone; MPP, methylprednisolone impact; CTX, cyclophosphamide; LEF, leflunomide; MMF, mycophenolate mofetil; ESRD, end stage renal disease; PR, partial remission.\n\nAs shown in Table 2, renal biopsies were obtained in all 10 patients.

Segmental focal or global glomerular necrosis was observed in 70% of the patients (7/10). Extensive or focal renal interstitial fibrosis was found in 60% of the patients (6/10). Immunofluorescence staining of Igg, IgA, IGM, C3, C1q, and FRA was performed in all 10 children with renal biopsy; no IC deposits were observed in 30% of the patients (3/10), a small amount of deposition was seen in 40% of the patients (4/10), and granular or linear distribution in the mesangial area or capillary wall was observed in 70% of the patients (7/10).\n\nTable 2 Summary of renal pathological features of 10 children with MPA.\n\nPatient\tDisease course before renal biopsy, mos\tNo. Glomerular\tNo. Crescents\tCellular crescents\tFibrocellular crescents\tFibrious crescents\tNo. Sclerotic glomeruli\tFocal/Segmental sclerotic\tImmune complex\tLocation of Immune complex\tInterstitial fibrosis\t\n1\t36.25\t13\t3\t3\t0\t0\t9\t0\t\u2013\t\t80%\t\n2\t1.25\t15\t5\t1\t2\t2\t2\t2\tC3 ++, FRA+\tlinear distribution in capillary wall\tWide distribution\t\n3\t3.25\t20\t7\t4\t0\t3\t10\t0\t\u2013\t\u2013\t40%\t\n4\t0.5\t9\t6\t6\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\n4 (2 years later)\t24.5\t12\t1\t0\t0\t1\t1\t4\tIgA+, IgG+, FRA++, IgM+++, C1q+-++\tgranular distribution in the mesangial area\tFocal distribution\t\n5\t1\t31\t1\t0\t1\t0\t2\t16\tIgM+++\tgranular distribution in the mesangial area\tFocal distribution\t\n6\t1.3\t12\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t3\tIgA+, IgM+\tgranular distribution in capillary wall\tMultifocal distribution\t\n7\t1.5\t20\t2\t0\t2\t0\t0\t0\tC3, FRA 3+\tgranular distribution in capillary wall\t\u2013\t\n8\t2.5\t15\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\tIgA, IgM+\tgranular distribution in the mesangial area\t\u2013\t\n9\t0.75\t14\t3\t0\t3\t0\t1\t3\tIgA, IgM+\tgranular distribution in capillary wall\t\u2013\t\n10\t1\t38\t31\t31\t0\t0\t7\t0\tIgG+++, C1q++\tlinear distribution in capillary wall\t\u2013\t\nFRA, fibrin related antigen.\n\nANCA and Other Laboratory Results\n\nAs shown in Table 3, positive MPO-ANCA and negative PR3-ANCA were observed in 100% of the patients (10/10). Twenty percentage of the patients (2/10) had a positive GBM antibody. ANA was tested positive and DSDNA was negative in 1 child with secondary MPA. Fifty percentage of the patients showed increased CRP and 90% showed elevated ESR levels. Decreased C3 levels were found in 10% of the cases and no abnormal serum C4 levels were seen in all 10 patients. Serum CRP levels were elevated in 5 children with AAV, which were reduced to normal level within 20 days after steroid therapy. ESR values were increased in 9 children with AAV, which recover to normal level within 0.25\u201324 months after steroid combined with immunosuppressive drugs therapy in seven patients. Decreased C3 was found in patient 4. She was given the combination therapy of hemodialysis, methylprednisone pulse and CTX therapy. Serum C3 level returned to normal 6 months later.\n\nTable 3 Summary of laboratory tests of 10 children with MPA.\n\nPatient\tMPO (0~20RU/ml)\tPR3 (0~20RU/ml)\tGBM (0~20RU/ml)\tANA (<1:100)\tdsDNA (0~100RU/ml)\tESR (0\u201320mm/h)\tTime to recover (months)\tC3 (0.8\u20131.8g/l)\tCRP (0-8mg/l)\tTime to recover(day)\tC4 (0.1\u20130.4g/l)\t\n1\t26.8, After 1 month of treatment, there was a decline, but not to normal, and there was no re-examination\t1.52\t2.03\t<1:100\t<10\t41\tNot examined\t1.12\t95.7\t20d\t0.2\t\n2\t29.61, After 7 months of treatment, it had decreased to normal, and then increased again, reaching the highest of 70.21\t1.96\t1.52\t<1:100\t<10\t110\t6\t1.01\t7.5\t\t0.25\t\n3\t40.6, Continuously above normal (25.71\u2013 62.38)\t2.38\t1.23\t<1:100\t<10\t56\t24\t1.41\t15.2\t10d\t0.31\t\n4\t34.75, not examined for change\t2.12\t3.58\t<1:100\t<10\t34\t6\t0.434\t8.8\t5d\t0.185\t\n5\t25.85, After 10 days of treatment, it returned to normal\t0.6\t40.35, After 10 days of treatment, the reexamination was normal, and the subsequent repeated reexaminations were normal\t<1:100\t<10\t44\t6\t1.21\t17.8\t10d\t0.2\t\n6\t158.25, After 5 months of treatment, it returned to normal\t1.0\t6.00\t<1:100\t<10\t27\t4\t1.03\t2.16\t\t0.27\t\n7\t177.25, not examined for change\t2.12\t5.00\t<1:100\t<10\t28\t3\t1.17\t10.4\t3d\t0.23\t\n8\t95.33, After 5 months of treatment, it returned to normal\t1.2\t4.70\t<1:100\t28.98\t13\t\t1.06\t1.38\t\t0.14\t\n9\t64.37, Follow-up for 4 months gradually decreased, but still higher than normal\t1.5\t11.40\t1:1000(+)\t60.42\t57\t0.25\t1.12\t3\t\t0.19\t\n10\t37.25, were high after reexaminations. 2 months later, hemodialysis was transferred to peritoneal dialysis, and no changes were detected again\t2.06\t94.64, were high after reexaminations. 2 months later, hemodialysis was transferred to peritoneal dialysis, and no changes were detected again\t<1:100\t<10\t95\tNot examined\t0.96\t2.4\t\t0.32\t\n\nTreatment and Prognosis\n\nAll of the 10 children were given immunosuppression and symptomatic supportive treatment. 90% of the patients (9/10) received Methylprednisolone pulse therapy, 40% of the patients (4/10) received Cyclophosphamide pulse treatment, 70% (7/10) received MMF treatment, and 10% (1/10) received leflunomide treatment. Hemodialysis and plasmapheresis were performed on the basis of immunosuppressive therapy (Table 1). The follow-up times of the 10 patients ranged from 4 months to 9 years. Two children presented as treatment failure and progressed to ESRD. Eighty percentage of the patients (8/10) maintained their clinical remission. Among them, two patients had complete remission and 6 had partial remission. At present, 1 of the 8 children with clinical remission had stopped taking corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, three had stopped taking corticosteroids therapy and only take oral mycophenolate ester therapy, and three had oral corticosteroids and mycophenolate ester maintenance therapy. The patients' urine test results were normal in two patients with microscopic hematuria in three patients, mild proteinuria in two patients, and microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria in two patient (Table 1).\n\nDiscussion\n\nMPA is rare in childhood and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. ANCA can be detected in the serum of most MPA patients, most of which are positive for MPO/PANCA, but a few patients can be positive for PR3/CANCA (10, 11). The pathogenesis of AAVs involves a complex interplay network of helper T (TH; TH-17) cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and various cytokines like IL-23, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3), as well as the complement system (12, 13). A variety of environmental factors such as infection and drugs are also believed to be related to ANCA production and vasculitis, among which the reported anti-thyroid drugs mainly include Tabazole, Propylthiazine, and Methimazole (14). In this study, 10 cases of children with MPA tested positive for the serum MPO antibody and 2 cases tested positive for the anti-GBM antibody. Nine patients were diagnosed as primary AAV and 1 13-year-old patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism for 4 years. The long-term oral administration of Methimazole was considered as secondary MPA. ANA was negative in all patients with primary MPA but positive in the girl with ATD-associated MPA. One patient had a low C3 serum level,9 patients had an increased ESR, and elevated CRP was found in 5 patients. However, the relationships between disease activity and serum C3, ESR, CRP levels were not observed in this study.\n\nMPA usually affects multiple organs. The lungs are the most frequently involved extra renal organ. MPA is the most common cause of pneumohemorrhagic nephritis syndrome. The common manifestations of lung damage include diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough, chest pain and imaging features are mainly ground glass and patchy shadows (15). In this study, 8 of the 10 MPA patients (80%) had respiratory symptoms, such as cough or hemoptysis and abnormal lung X-ray or CT examination, which manifested as a patchy, nodular grind glass shadow, localized emphysema or increased and blurred lung texture. The kidneys are also most commonly affected in MPA, and may also be the only affected organ. In the AR Chi Ve survey network study, according to the EMA criteria, renal involvement, including proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and renal insufficiency were present in 3/4 of the patients and serum creatinine levels were moderately to severely elevated in 48% of the children with renal involvement. 1/3 of the children developed hypertension and 1/4 of the children needed renal replacement therapy treatment at the onset (16). In this study, all 10 children had renal impairment, hematuria, and proteinuria, including three cases of gross hematuria, three cases of nephrotic proteinuria, six cases with renal impairment at diagnosis, and two cases of hemodialysis or plasmapheresis.\n\nThe pathological features of the kidneys in MPA patients were glomerular capillary segmental fibrinoid necrosis with a crescent formation. Different stages of the glomerular disease were also found in one patient (16). Currently, there are no guidelines for the treatment of MPA or AAV in children and the clinical treatment scheme mainly refers to the recommendations of adult AAV. The 2016 AAV treatment recommendation issued by the European Federation of Rheumatology (EULAR) and the European Dialysis and Transplantation Association (EDTA) stated that glucocorticoid (GC) (including Methylprednisolone pulse) combined with Cyclophosphamide or Rituximab is recommended for AAV-induced remission therapy that threatens organ function and life. For AAV induction and remission therapy without organ function involvement, GC combined with Methotrexate or Mycophenate is recommended (17). In 2017, the expert consensus of the children's blood purification committee of the pediatrician branch of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association stated that plasma exchange can be used in AAV children (18). Early diagnosis and early treatment are key factors for patients with MPA. Although most of the patients responded to induction therapy, some patients progressed to CKD stages.\n\nIn our study, the follow-up time of the 10 cases was 4 months to 9 years; 8 cases had a normal renal function and two cases progressed to ESRD.As long as AAV was diagnosed, early and intensive immunosuppressive therapy was used. Our remission rate was 80% and was similar to previous studies (3). At present, one of the 8 children with normal renal function had stopped taking prednisone and immunosuppressive therapy; three patients had stopped taking corticosteroids therapy and received Mycophenolate, and; three patients received oral corticosteroids therapy and Mycophenolate in the maintenance phase. The patients' urine test results were normal in two patients, microscopic hematuria was found in three patients, mild proteinuria in two patients, and microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria in one patient. Therefore, regular and long-term follow-ups are needed for evaluating the prognosis of children with MPA. However, our limitation is that 4 months is still too short to assess the effect of therapy and disease prognosis. In addition, retrospective nature of the research and the wide range of follow up also limited our study because it is difficult to draw firm conclusions if one patient is followed for 4 months and the other for 9 years.\n\nConclusions\n\nFemale predisposition and positive MPO-ANCA antibody were prominent in children with MPA. The kidneys and lungs were the most frequently involved organs in MPA. Corticosteroid combined with immunosuppressive therapy was recommended for the treatment of the disease. Take-home messages are early diagnosis, prompt aggressive treatment, and regular follow-ups are very important for improving the patients' long-term outcomes.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\n\nEthics Statement\n\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University.

She was switched to topical voriconazole drop in both eyes and gradually improved with excellent visual outcome. Urogenital cultures were negative. Contact lens use was discontinued through the course of treatment.\nBilateral Candida keratitis is rare and has not been reported in a nummular pattern and in a patient without significant ocular surface issues or chronic use of steroid drops. Differential diagnosis of nummular keratitis mostly includes viral and inflammatory conditions. This case highlights the need to stay alert to a possible fungal etiology and a potential risk of using topical steroids at initial presentation of nummular keratitis.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1 Introduction\n\nNummular keratitis consists of multiple anterior stromal infiltrates. It has been described associated with viral and inflammatory conditions, mostly adenovirus.2 We present a case of misdiagnosed fungal keratitis due to a bilateral nummular presentation. Fungal keratitis is rare and often a diagnostic challenge as it can present similarly to other types of keratitis. Topical steroids, while frequently prescribed on initial presentation of ocular inflammation, may contibute to further progression of infection.\n\n2 Case report\n\nA 41-year-old female presented to clinic for sudden onset of redness, swelling and mattering of both eyes with associated irritation, and photophobia occurring for five days. She worked in a bakery and wore soft contact lenses but denied sleeping or swimming in them. She was previously seen by three different doctors. She was initially diagnosed by her optometrist with adenoviral conjunctivitis and tested for it but was negative. She was then thought to have a chemical keratitis. She was started on a combination of loteprednol etabonate 0.5% and tobramycin 0.3% ophthalmic suspension (Zylet, Bausch and Lomb). As she was not improving, she was referred to our department for evaluation and management.\n\nHer review of systems was positive for rhinorrhea and a productive cough for which she was treated with oral azithromycin and one intramuscular injection of steroid by her primary care physician. Her past medical history was significant for well controlled diabetes mellitus on insulin, mild lupus that did not necessitate any systemic medication and a history of right periorbital cellulitis 15 years prior. She was also a smoker and was allergic to penicillin, Bactrim and moxifloxacin.\n\nOn presentation, her best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Slit lamp examination of the right eye was remarkable for mild conjunctival injection and six scattered small round cornea anterior stromal infiltrates and an epithelial defect over the largest infiltrate (Fig. 1). The left eye had more conjunctival injection and two round corneal anterior stromal infiltrates: a small paracentral one and a larger 1.2 mm denser peripheral one with overlying 1mm epithelial defect over the infiltrate (Fig. 1). Intraocular pressures were borderline: 22\u00a0mmHg in the right and 20\u00a0mmHg in the left eye. The rest of the eye exam was within normal limits. Corneal scraping specimens from the right cornea was sent for herpes simplex (HSV) PCR testing and for bacterial and fungal stains and cultures. The left eye was extremely photophobic and scraping was difficult to obtain. She was started on oral valacyclovir and doxycycline. Zylet was stopped. She was instructed to use frequent lubricating drops, oral ibuprofen for pain, and to discontinue any contact lens wear. Close follow-up was required. Two days later, Candida albicans was isolated on bacterial culture from the right eye. HSV PCR was negative. She was thus started on a compounded drop of 1% voriconazole hourly in both eyes. On follow-up, the infiltrates of the right eye healed progressively while the larger peripheral infiltrate of the left eye was slower to respond and caused around twenty percent stromal thinning. It finally scarred down two months later (Fig. 2). Voriconazole was progressively tapered over a three-month period. There was no recurrence at the four month follow-up examination. Topical nonsteroidal drops were added for pain control. During the course of treatment, the patient also developed ocular hypertension that was controlled with dorzolamide drops. Her best corrected vision on last examination remained 20/20 in both eyes.Fig. 1 Nummular keratitis seen on slit lamp exam on initial presentation of right eye and left eye. A, Slit lamp picture of the right eye showing conjunctival injection and scattered small round corneal superficial stromal infiltrates labeled with astericks (*). B, Slit lamp picture of the left eye showing conjunctival injection and two round corneal anterior stromal infiltrates marked with asterisks (*). One infiltrate had an overlying epithelial defect stained with fluorescein. The patient was very photophobic hence it was difficult to obtain pictures of the full cornea.\n\nFig. 1\n\nFig. 2 Resolved nummular keratitis on slit lamp of right eye(A) and left eye (B). Slit lamp examination three months after initial presentation showing healing corneal infiltrates, marked with an astericks (*).\n\nFig. 2\n\nGiven that our patient did not have significant risk factors for Candida albicans keratitis and given the bilateral occurrence, it was decided to test for a urogenital source of infection, and the culture result was negative. Contact lenses were not obtained for cultures and the patient was advised to discontinue contact lens use through the course of treatment.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nNummular keratitis, first described in 1905,1 is a corneal sign, rather than a specific disease.2 Corneal structure is disrupted with fine granular coin-shaped opacities causing extreme patient discomfort and possible loss of vision.2 This is predominantly seen with viral keratoconjunctivitis, due to adenovirus or herpes zoster infections. Adenovirus strains produce an infection of corneal epithelial cells, with superficial punctate keratitis followed by nummular subepithelial infiltrates.2 Other causes of corneal subepithelial infiltrates reported in literature include brucellosis, acanthamoeba, Lyme disease, adult inclusion conjunctivitis, Epstein Barr virus, Herpes Simplex, and hyperimmunoglobulin D disease.2,3 It has not been reported associated with Candida keratitis as in this report. Reported distinctions made from adenovirus nummular keratitis include unilateral presentations, deeper infiltrates, accompanying systemic disease, and unusual persistence of lesions.2 In our case, the most common etiology for nummular keratitis were ruled out as adenovirus and herpes virus testing were negative. Acanthamoeba was important to consider given contact lens wear, but our patient denied any exposure to contaminated water and it is unlikely to present bilaterally.3 She had no exposures suggestive of brucellosis or Lyme disease. Concerning an inflammatory etiology, the patient did have a history of lupus, but she was otherwise asymptomatic for it and was not requiring any immunosuppressive treatment. While topical steroids may be considered for treatment of different etiologies of nummular keratitis, it would be detrimental in a case of fungal keratitis, hence the importance to keep this diagnosis in mind.4 Fungal keratitis is not as common as bacterial or viral etiologies, as it accounts for less than 10% of all corneal infection.5 It is often difficult to differentiate from other causes of corneal ulcers. A retrospective review by Sun et al. showed that only two of twenty-nine cases of Candida were diagnosed at initial presentation.6\n\nKnowing predisposing factors and typical signs of Candida keratitis on examination allows for a high index of suspicion. A case series of patients with Candida keratitis found that all patients had a combination of two or more risk factors, with ocular surface disease and steroid use being the most prevalent.7 Our patient did not have any obvious risk factors except corrective contact lens wear, associated with only four of the twenty-one patients in the case series.7 Interestingly, our patient works as a professional baker using yeast while wearing contact lenses, which raised the question about occupational exposure. However, baker's yeast is a different species called Saccharomyces cerevisae. Theoretically, the bakery environment may have been the source of Candida, with various growth mediums for yeast, that can extend to contact lens via contamination and biofilm formation.8\n\nLiterature reports describe fungal infections progressing with an indolent course, with less conjunctival injection than bacterial infections.9 Yeast driven ulcers are described as superficial, white, raised colonies or satellite lesions with distinct borders, and corneal infiltrates with feathery edges and intact epithelium with deep stromal involvement.5,10 The presentation of Candida keratitis in our case was acute and its corneal pattern is to be differentiated from the typical satellite lesions by a more scattered pattern and absence of plaque like aspect. Other indications to suspect fungal etiology include presentations worsening with steroids and lack of improvement with antibiotics.10 Our case of Candida keratitis was also atypical due to the simultaneous bilateral presentation. There are rare case reports of bilateral Candida keratitis, presenting in a sequential fashion.11 A recent report suggested a urogenital source for the eye infection. Our patient was tested for a urogenital source, and her culture was negative. The patient in that article also turned out to be HIV positive.11 HIV has been implicated in other cases of fungal keratitis as well.12 Our patient reported recent negative testing and deferred repeat testing for HIV. Definitive diagnosis of a fungal ulcer is made from corneal scraping and cultures prior to initiating antifungal treatment.\n\nAmphotericin B has been considered the mainstay for treatment of Candida infection.6 We elected to use voriconazole, a newer antifungal, due to its better bioavailability and it worked very well for our patient. Previous reports also showed good efficacy of topical voriconazole on Candida ulcers.13 Our patient's largest infiltrate initially progressed, causing mild thinning of the cornea, before it started responding to treatment after few days. This is likely due to a larger and deeper yeast load that required more time to be sterilized, although Peponis et al. speculate that initial worsening could be due to abrupt discontinuation of topical steroid in misdiagnosed fungal resulting in acute rebound inflammatory reaction.4\n\nWith limited treatment options and delayed diagnosis, fungal ulcers have reportedly poor outcomes and often require surgical intervention.10 Sun et al. determined that a third of patients in their case series of Candida keratitis required a keratoplasty and two out of 26 had to be enucleated or eviscerated.6 Qiao et al. reported even worse outcomes with 76% requiring surgical intervention and three out of 21 requiring enucleation.7 Our patient had a very favorable outcome likely due to the absence of chronic ocular disease that is often present in other cases of Candida keratitis. She was able to maintain her presenting best corrected visual acuity of 20/20. Presenting visual acuity and the presence of a corneal graft seem to be prognostic factors in candida keratitis.6\n\nPatients with misdiagnosed fungal keratitis often present on a combination of topical steroids and antibiotics. A recent retrospective chart review of fungal keratitis in a South Korean hospital found prior topical steroid use with worse disease progression, treatment failure, and more commonly necessitating surgical intervention.14 Cessation of prior topical steroid use in misdiagnosed fungal keratitis presents with its own dilemma as it can further contribute to worsening inflammation and corneal necrosis.4 Our case further emphasizes risks associated with topical steroid use in atypical cases of keratitis.\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nBilateral nummular keratitis due to mycotic etiology is exceedingly rare. This case uniquely details the clinical presentation of bilateral Candida albicans nummular keratitis associated with contact lens use and possible occupational exposure. Corneal scraping is essential for ambiguous corneal infiltrates to diagnose fungal infections. Our patient was treated with an antibiotic and topical steroid regimen prior to diagnosis of fungal keratitis which could have worsened the prognosis. Monotherapy with topical voriconazole was sufficient for resolving our patient's infection and led to a favorable outcome.\n\nPatient consent\n\nConsent to publish the case report was not obtained.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nOtherwise Unexplained Transient QTc Prolongation in a Patient Admitted with COVID Disease.\n\nABSTRACT:\nBackground. Several cardiovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been previously described. QT prolongation has been reported in COVID-19 infection in association with medications such as azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine but has not previously been reported as a direct result of COVID-19 infection. Case summary. We report the case of a 65-year-old female who developed a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) during a hospital admission with COVID-19. This patient was not on any QT prolonging treatment, serum electrolytes were normal, and there was no identifiable reversible cause for the QTc lengthening. Daily serial ECGs during admission showed resolution of the ventricular repolarization abnormality in synchronization with resolution of her COVID-19 viral illness. Discussions. Although there have been reports of QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients, previous reports of this are for patients receiving medication that causes QT prolongation. This case uniquely demonstrates the development and resolution of this temporary ventricular repolarization abnormality in a patient with a structurally normal heart with no evidence of myocardial fibrosis or edema on cardiac MRI, that is unexplained by other confounding factors, such as medication. This suggests there may be a direct association between COVID-19 and temporary QTc prolongation.\n\nTEXT:\n1. Introduction\n\nProlonged QTc is a potentially dangerous ventricular repolarization disorder that can lead to adverse events including torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death. Causes include both congenital prolongation and acquired causes. Acquired causes include medication, acute electrolyte disturbances, systemic inflammation, and hypoxia [1\u20133]. There is increasing evidence that inflammatory cytokines, in particular, interleukin 6 (IL-6), can have a direct effect on ventricular cardiomyocyte ion channels, prolonging the action potential and hence the QTc [4\u20137]. There are few existing case reports of QTc prolongation in patients with COVID in the absence of conventional risk factors [8, 9]. This case suggests there may be an association with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and temporary QTc prolongation.\n\n2. Case Presentation\n\nWe report the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian female referred to hospital by her general practitioner with dyspnoea, chest pain, and general malaise, following a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 in the community two days prior to presenting. She had a 5-day history of dyspnoea on exertion and orthopnoea. This was associated with intermittent pleuritic chest pain and fevers. Her medical history included breast cancer treated with a lumpectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. There was no family history of sudden cardiac death or sudden adult death syndrome, no family history of long QT syndrome, and no family history of congenital deafness. She was not on any QT-prolonging treatment or any rate-limiting therapy, and her only regular medication was rosuvastatin. Her physical examination on presentation was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed a mildly elevated troponin I of 0.06\u2009ng/mL (normal range 0\u20130.04\u2009ng/mL) which remained at 0.06\u2009ng/mL on serial checking and a D-dimer of 624\u2009ng/mL. Inflammatory markers were normal on admission with a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 7\u2009mg/L (reference range 0.1\u20135\u2009mg/L) and a white cell count (WCC) of 3 \u00d7 109/L. Her lymphocyte count was 1.25 \u00d7 109/L. IL-6 levels were not measured. Radiological investigations on admission revealed a normal chest X-ray, and a CT pulmonary angiogram showed patchy peripheral pulmonary infiltrates with no pulmonary embolus. Her admission ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 47 beats per minute and a QTc of 495\u2009ms, shown in Figure 1. QT intervals and RR intervals were measured manually for the calculation of the QTc using Bazett's method; the calculated values were consistent with the automatic machine measurements.\n\nA repeat ECG one day postadmission showed a QTc of 621\u2009ms, shown in Figure 2. She was commenced on telemetry with daily monitoring of electrolytes and ECGs. Her serum electrolytes were within normal limits throughout the course of the admission. Medications used throughout the admission included enoxaparin and rosuvastatin regularly and paracetamol, lactulose, and cyclizine as required. Cetirizine was subsequently prescribed after the first week of admission. A cardiac MRI was booked in an external centre, and the patient remained in our hospital until she became noninfectious from COVID-19 prior to transfer for MRI. Her QTc decreased gradually over the course of her 24-day hospital admission. From a respiratory perspective, she remained well, her peripheral oxygen saturation levels were normal throughout the entire admission, and she did not develop any supplementary oxygen requirement. Transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable, revealing a structurally normal heart and no evidence of heart failure. Cardiac MRI confirmed a structurally normal heart with no evidence of myocardial fibrosis or edema. A trivial pericardial effusion was present. Her QTc resolved to a normal level of 445\u2009ms, shown in Figure 3. She remained clinically well and was discharged.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nThe average QTc in healthy persons after puberty is 420 \u00b1 20 milliseconds. Generally, the 99th percentile QTc values are 470 milliseconds in postpubertal males and 480 milliseconds in postpubertal females [10]. A QTc > 500 milliseconds is considered highly abnormal for both males and females. Several manifestations of cardiovascular disease have been previously described in COVID-19 [11]. Existing literature regarding QTc prolongation in COVID-19 focuses on predictable pharmacodynamic effects of offlicense pharmacotherapeutic strategies such as antimalarial drugs [12]. The prolongation previously seen has been attributable to medications with this known effect [13, 14]. This case demonstrates an acute ventricular repolarization abnormality in the setting of COVID-19 infection, that self-resolved as the viral illness course resolved. This self-limiting temporary disturbance, in the absence of alternative explanations, suggests that there may be a direct effect on ventricular repolarization from COVID-19. Cetirizine, an anti-H1 histamine receptor drug, was prescribed following a week of admission, which is recognized to have QT-prolonging potential [15]. It is possible that the effects of COVID-associated systemic inflammation on the QTc may have been enhanced by the concomitant cetirizine treatment.\n\nThe relationship between COVID-19 and ventricular repolarization is an area of worldwide interest with an ongoing trial in critically unwell patients to determine the effect of COVID-19 (and its treatments) on ventricular repolarization as measured by the QTc [16]. Systemic inflammation rapidly induces cytokine-mediated ventricular electrical remodeling and significant QTc prolongation [17, 18]. It is possible that an important factor involved in QTc prolongation in COVID-19 is the systemic inflammation characterizing the disease, often described as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d in which IL-6 seems to play a central role. This systemic inflammation via elevated IL-6 is itself an independent risk factor for QTc prolongation, by modulating cardiomyocyte ion channel expression [18]. Other viral illnesses have been reported to exhibit this effect\u2014HIV seropositivity is associated with a prolonged QT [19]. Physiological changes in acute illness can also lead to a temporary ventricular repolarization abnormality\u2014core body temperature can impact QT duration with moderate hypothermia causing temporary prolongation of the QTc as well as fever [20, 21]. However, in this case, our patient remained normothermic throughout the admission, and her CRP and WCC were only very mildly elevated while these electrocardiographic changes occurred, as shown in Table 1. Although CRP synthesis is largely dependent on direct hepatocyte stimulation by IL-6, it is possible for a mismatch to exist (for example, in patients with abnormal liver function) between circulating levels of IL-6 and CRP. Despite this patient having a normal liver function, it cannot be excluded that the blood concentration of IL-6 (which is the actual mediator of the electrophysiologic effects of systemic inflammation on the cardiomyocyte) was higher than expected based on the CRP levels. However, this case suggests that there may be a novel COVID-19 infection-specific mechanism for QT prolongation not previously described.\n\nData Availability\n\nBackground information is available on medical database Pubmed.\n\nConsent\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nFigure 1 Shows day 1 ECG with a QTc of 495\u2009ms.\n\nFigure 2 Shows day 2 ECG with a QTc of 621\u2009ms.\n\nFigure 3 Shows day 24 ECG with a QTc of 445\u2009ms.\n\nTable 1 Association between inflammatory markers and corrected QT interval.\n\n\tDay 1\tDay 2\tDay 3\tDay 5\tDay 6\tDay 7\tDay 8\tDay 10\tDay 13\tDay 20\tDay 24\t\nCRP (mg/L)\t7.3\t7.4\t6.2\t9.2\t10.4\t11\t12\t15.5\t8.2\t5.5\tNot recorded\t\nWCC (\u00d7109/L)\t3.57\t4.11\t2.85\t2.97\t3.21\t2.77\t3.7\t3.5\t5.52\t5.44\t\nQTc (ms)\t495\t621\t561\t516\t502\t479\tNot recorded\t465\t465\t445\t\nCRP: C-reactive protein; mg/L: milligrams per liter; WCC: white cell count, QTc: QT interval corrected; ms: milliseconds.",

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nA Case of Hemorrhagic Cholecystitis and Hemobilia Under Anticoagulation Therapy.\n\nABSTRACT:\nBACKGROUND Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare disease which can be fatal in some cases. Hemorrhagic cholecystitis can sometimes be confused with common biliary diagnoses, as its symptoms imitate other hepatobiliary diseases. We report a case of hemorrhagic cholecystitis with hemobilia caused by the administration of anticoagulant agents. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old man was admitted with abdominal distention and pain. Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) showed a distended and wall-thickened gallbladder with hyperdense materials. Based on these findings and the laboratory data, the patient was diagnosed with acute cholecystitis with cholangitis. Because the patient's hemodynamics were stable, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed first to improve the bile flow. The results of ERCP showed blood from the common bile duct by cannulation, which was suspected to reflect hemorrhagic cholecystitis. As the abdominal symptom and CT findings worsened on the day after ERCP, emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. An examination of the specimen revealed ulcer formation on the mucosal side of the gallbladder. The patient was discharged 6 days after the operation without any surgical complications. CONCLUSIONS ERCP and early laparoscopic cholecystectomy were performed for a patient with hemorrhagic cholecystitis and hemobilia. Early diagnosis and treatment can lead to good outcomes in patients with hemorrhagic cholecystitis. Since the number of patients who are taking antithrombotic agents is increasing, hemorrhagic cholecystitis should be considered when any unusual imaging findings associated with cholecystitis are observed.\n\nTEXT:\nBackground\nHemorrhagic cholecystitis is a specific condition of acute cholecystitis and is potentially fatal [1]. Hemorrhage in the gallbladder may be caused by various reasons, including trauma, iatrogenic causes, cancer, and bleeding disorders. In many cases, symptoms of hemorrhagic cholecystitis, which include right upper-quadrant pain, fever, and increasing leukocytes, resemble those of calculous cholecystitis. Hemorrhagic cholecystitis may be hard to detect because it frequently shows symptoms that similar to other common diagnoses. Imaging can reveal the characteristic findings to help diagnose this rare disease. An early diagnosis can lead to good treatment outcomes. We herein describe a case of hemorrhagic cholecystitis with hemobilia due to bleeding from the gallbladder, performed with early laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\nCase Report\nA 70-year-old man with a 7-h history of abdominal distension, pain, and nausea was admitted to our hospital. His past medical history included lumbar disc herniation, congestive heart failure, old myocardial infarction, and thrombosis in the left ventricle. He had been taking warfarin (3.0 mg) and aspirin (100 mg). Clopidogrel (75 mg) was started under the suspicion of angina pectoris, 3 weeks prior to his admission, and treatment at the Cardiology Department of our hospital had been planned. At presentation, he was afebrile, with blood pressure 131/84 mmHg and pulse 117 beats/min. An abdominal examination revealed a soft and flat abdomen; tenderness was present over the right upper quadrant, without any involuntary guarding or rebound tenderness. He had no change in bowel movements and no melena. The laboratory findings at the time of presentation were: white blood cell count, 13 000/uL; hemoglobin, 15.1 g/dL; platelet count, 19 5000/uL; total bilirubin, 2.3 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 1481 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 988 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase, 1058 IU/L; gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, 315 IU/L; C-reactive protein, 0.96 mg/dL; and activated partial thromboplastin time, 34.8 s. Two days before he came to our hospital, his international normalized ratio (INR) was 2.41. Cholangitis was suspected based on these laboratory data, and acute cholecystitis was confirmed with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen. It showed a distended, edematous gallbladder containing hyperdense material, suggestive of blood. There was no dilatation at the common or intrahepatic bile ducts. Ascites was not detected in the abdominal cavity (Figure 1A, 1B). Ultrasound (US) showed a slightly distended gallbladder with wall-thickening, gallstones, and mass-like debris without shadowing, which suggested the possibility of pus or hemorrhage (Figure 1C). Due to jaundice, suspected cholangitis, and stable hemodynamics, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed. Fresh blood was observed on the duodenal papilla. After cannulation of the bile duct, the flow of old blood from the mammary papilla was recognized (Figure 2A, 2B). On cholangiography, numerous defects in the common bile duct were noticed and the common bile duct seemed to be filled with clots (Figure 2C). The hemobilia was initially improved, and an endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) tube was placed.\n\nOn the next day of admission, contrast CT was performed, as an abdominal physical examination showed the appearance of peritoneal irritation at the right upper quadrant. The contrast-enhanced phase revealed extravasation of contrast medium into the gallbladder lumen (Figure 3A). CT demonstrated the appearance of fluid accumulation in the Morrison fossa (Figure 3B). Since the abdominal symptoms and CT findings were exacerbated, emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, showing a distended edematous gallbladder with a small amount of hemorrhagic ascites. Subtotal cholecystectomy was conducted under laparoscopy, and a \u201cC-tube\u201d was placed into the common bile duct through the cystic duct. The sample showed that the gallbladder was filled with dark blood, clots, and gallstones (Figure 4). A pathological examination of the specimen confirmed hemorrhaging, acute inflammation, and the formation of an ulcer on the mucosal side of the gallbladder. There was a muscular artery on the bottom of the ulcer, which might have been broken due to inflammation. No malignancy was detected. The postoperative course was uneventful. Anticoagulation therapy was successfully restarted on postoperative day 2. The C-tube was removed on postoperative day 3. He was discharged without any complications 6 days after the procedure.\n\nDiscussion\nHemorrhagic cholecystitis with hemobilia is a rare disease associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality if perforation or necrosis occurs [1]. Sandblom published the first report of bleeding from the hepatobiliary system as hemobilia in 1948 [2]. Shah and Clegg first reported hemobilia caused by cholecystitis as hemorrhagic cholecystitis in 1979 [3]. Iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic factors can cause bleeding from the gall-bladder. The non-iatrogenic causes of hemobilia include trauma, malignancy, administration anticoagulants, and bleeding associated with renal failure or cirrhosis [1].\n\nCholelithiasis might be associated with microbleeding from the gallbladder, which results in injuries to the mucosa and vessel walls. Furthermore, it is thought that high pressure in the gallbladder due to acute cholecystitis can lead to bleeding because of damage to the mucosa and vessel walls [4\u20136]. Gremmels et al. [7] described pathological findings of acute cholecystitis, showing that intramural inflammation led to erosion of the mucosa, infarction, and ischemia. The mucosal breakdown may cause bleeding into the gallbladder, and the intraluminal effusions and debris may mix with blood [7]. In our case, the specimen showed the formation of an ulcer on the mucosal side of the gallbladder, which might have caused the bleeding. No specific bleeding disorder was observed; however, he was taking 3 antithrombotic agents. Although he had been taking 2 antithrombotic drugs for a long time, acute hemorrhagic cholecystitis occurred 3 weeks after an additional anti-thrombotic drug was started. PT-INR were prolonged at admission. Gallbladder stone and antithrombotic drugs might play an important role in development of this disease. Without anticoagulant therapy, mucosal ulcers caused by gallbladder stones may heal quickly, but they will not heal while an anticoagulant drug is being taken. That causes continuous bleeding, which results in acute hemorrhagic cholecystitis. Cholecystolithiasis and the oral administration of antithrombotic agents seemed to both be associated with the bleeding in the present case.\n\nThe characteristic symptoms of hemobilia are abdominal pain, jaundice, and gastrointestinal bleeding through the common bile duct [8]. As these symptoms resemble those of common hepatobiliary diseases (right upper-quadrant pain, a Murphy sign, and leukocytosis), hemorrhagic cholecystitis can be easily missed by both physical and laboratory examinations [9]. History taking, a physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging are important for the initiation of appropriate treatment of hemorrhagic cholecystitis. Although the physical and laboratory findings are similar to those for calculous acute cholecystitis, it is crucial to assess the patients\u2019 history and investigate the administration of anticoagulants. Imaging findings can help in the diagnosis and demonstrate the characteristic findings of wall thickening of the distended gall-bladder and heterogeneous materials inside. US findings can show gallbladder distension with wall thickening, and heterogeneous echogenic materials. Blood is visualized as hyper-echoic, non-shadowing, non-mobile intraluminal materials in the gallbladder lumen [10]. CT can show the same findings as US. Furthermore, Pandya and O\u2019Malley emphasized the value of the arterial phase of contrast-enhanced CT, which can indicate active extravasation of contrast into the gallbladder [11].\n\nMany cases of hemorrhagic cholecystitis require endoscopic treatment, radiologic intervention, or surgery [12]. ERCP plays an important role in the treatment of hemobilia. As clots from a bleeding gallbladder may also cause common bile duct obstruction and jaundice, removing them in the common bile duct could lead to an improvement in bile flow [13]. Bleeding from the papilla of Vater is recognized in 30% of patients with hemorrhage cholecystitis when ERCP is performed [14]. Regardless of cause, the treatment for cholecystitis should follow the Tokyo Guideline 2018 (TG2018) [15]. TG2018 states that cholecystectomy is a definitive treatment for cholecystitis, while a percutaneous cholecystostomy can be performed for acute management bridging to surgery in patients with significant comorbidities [16]. However, strategies for treatment should be carefully selected. There was a case report of 1 case that underwent urgent cholecystostomy under anticoagulant therapy; unfortunately, the hyperdense contents increased within the gallbladder and CBD on follow-up CT [11]. Thus, cholecystostomy should be considered an option for preventing the need for surgery or as a bridge to surgery. TG2018 recommends early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis in patients without significant comorbidities, because laparoscopic surgery is becoming safer due to the development of techniques and devices. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients receiving antithrombotic therapy has been controversial. However, there are a few reports of the safe performance of laparoscopic surgery for patients under antithrombotic therapy [17]. Thus, urgent surgical management, which is now recommended early in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, should be considered, according to surgeon experience, in order to prevent more serious complications [9,15]. In our case, as laboratory data showed suspected cholangitis and the patient\u2019s hemodynamics were stable after he was admitted to our hospital, so ERCP was performed first in order to improve the flow of bile. The detection of blood in the biliary tract can reveal hemorrhagic cholecystitis. An emergency operation was performed because perforation was suspected based on the appearance of ascites and the worsening of abdominal symptoms on the following day.\n\nConclusions\nERCP and early laparoscopic cholecystectomy were performed for a patient with hemorrhagic cholecystitis and hemobilia who was receiving antithrombotic agents. Early diagnosis and treatment are the most important aspects in the management of hemorrhagic cholecystitis, and can lead to good outcomes. Since large numbers of patients are treated with various antithrombotic agents, hemorrhagic cholecystitis should be considered when unusual presentations of cholecystitis are encountered.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nNone.\n\nFigure 1.

As well as the acral manifestations of COVID-19, the acute appearance of Half and half nail sign can be explained by a vascular involvement that may induce a transient matrix injury.\nWe report the first description of acute onset of half and half nails during COVID-19 severe infection in 2 patients without a history of kidney failure or any other condition previously described, suggesting that it can be considered as a severity marker.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1 Introduction\n\nThe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic brought the interest of all physicians including dermatologists, especially with the description of cutaneous manifestations related to the infectious episode [1]. Increasing cases of nails changes were also reported in association with the coronavirus [[2], [3], [4]].\n\nHalf and Half nail sign or Lindsay nails is a nail disorder that occurs with various chronic diseases, commonly seen in chronic renal failure. It is characterized by red, pink or brownish discoloration of the distal nail with a whitish appearance of the remaining nail.\n\nWe report 2 cases of acute onset of half and half nail sign occurring with severe COVID-19 infection.\n\nOur case reports were reported in line with CARE guideline [5].\n\n2 Case reports\n\n2.1 Case number 1\n\nAn 82-year-old male, diabetic on insulin therapy, had been admitted to the COVID-19 department. He was diagnosed with a severe COVID -19 pneumonia confirmed with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and CT scan that showed 75% impairment scored CORADS 6, with progressive deterioration of respiratory function motivating his transfer to intensive care five days after his admission. Laboratory findings showed lymphopenia and elevation of inflammation markers, kidney function remained normal during his hospitalization period.\n\nTwo days before respiratory symptoms, the patient reported the appearance of fingernails changes. Physical examination found color changes of all fingernails, with the white proximal portion of the nail and red distal half in favor of Lindsay's nails or half and half nail aspect (Fig. 1). Dermoscopy gave a clear vision to the sharp line of demarcation between the two portions, in addition to some mega-capillaries (Fig. 2).Fig. 1 Clinical image : Half and Half nail aspect in fingers of a patient with severe COVID-19 infection.\n\nFig. 1\n\nFig. 2 Dermoscopic image showing a clear demarcation between red and white area.\n\nFig. 2\n\nThe patient died in the intensive care unit due to respiratory distress.\n\n2.2 Case number 2\n\nA 71-year-old woman, diabetic on oral treatment, without a history of kidney failure, anemia, or digestive disease, had been admitted to COVID-19 department for a severe infection; scored CORADS 6 with a positive PCR, 50\u201375% impairment in chest tomography, elevation of inflammation markers with a normal kidney function. One month later, she had been referred to our dermatology department for a pustular rash with facial edema, that was diagnosed as Acute Generalised Exanthematous Pustulosis to aspirin. Furthermore, physical examination showed half and half aspect in all fingernails evolving since the infectious episode.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nHalf and half nails, also known as or Lindsay's nails were first described by Bean in 1963 [6] and later described by Lindsay in 1967 in association with kidney disease [7]. Clinically, it shows as a nail with a white proximal portion and a reddish-brown or a pink distal portion, with a sharp demarcation line between the two portions, which usually remains parallel to the distal free margin of the nail. It is a rare clinical finding, but it can be seen in chronic renal failure. It can also appear in yellow nails syndrome, Crohn's disease, Kawasaki's disease, Behcet's disease, cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, zinc deficiency, citrullinemia, pellagra, and HIV infection [8]. The Lindsay nails pathogenesis is not clear, but an acidosis and an increase in toxic uremic substances is suspected to stimulate melanin formation by nail matrix melanocytes.\n\nCOVID-19-associated cutaneous and nail manifestations have been increasingly seen in the last year, garnering attention from the national and international dermatological communities [9].\n\nMany nail changes have been described recently in association with COVID-19 infection, such as transverse leukonychia (Mees lines) [[2], [3], [4]]; red half-moon nail sign [[2], [3], [4]] and Beau lines [[2], [3], [4]]. These nail alterations can be explained by keratinization disorders of nail tablet associated with vascularization alterations of nail beds.\n\nAmong the acral cutaneous manifestations of covid19, COVID chilblains or \u2018COVID toes\u2019 were widely reported, their pathogenesis remains unclear but a vascular involvement were highly suggested due to the presence of immunoglobulins and C3 deposits on dermal vessels and the presence vascular microthrombi [10]. The genesis of Half and half nails sign during severe COVID-19 infection can be related to that same vascular involvement that may induce a transient matrix injury.\n\nEven if both of our patients have a history of diabetes mellitus, the acute onset of half and half nails sign, and its occurrence during the infectious episode suggest that it is more likely that these nail changes are related to the COVID-19 infection.\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak, several clinical manifestations were reported, including cutaneous and nail changes. We report the first description of acute onset of half and half nails during COVID-19 severe infection in 2 patients suggesting that it can be considered as a severity marker.\n\nFunding resources\n\nNone.\n\nThis study was published as an e-poster in the EADV spring symposium.\n\nIt is also published as a pre-print by Authorea\n\nProvenance and peer review not commissioned, externally peer-reviewed.\n\nAnnals of Medicine and Surgery.\n\nEthical approval\n\nApproval has been given.\n\nConsent\n\nConsent has been obtained.\n\nAuthor contribution\n\nSoraya Aouali: Conception.

Cardiotoxicity following 5-aminosalicyclic-acid therapy remains a rare yet serious complication and can often be challenging to distinguish from myocarditis presenting as an extra-intestinal manifestation of IBD.\nWe present a case of a 22-year-old man with a background of ulcerative colitis commenced on a mesalazine preparation for disease progression. He presented to our hospital 12 days following drug initiation with acute chest pain, peak troponin-T of 242\u2009ng/L, dynamic electrocardiogram changes, and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram. The clinical diagnosis of myopericarditis was suspected and mesalazine was stopped shortly after. Outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance performed 2 weeks following mesalazine cessation demonstrated a recovery of cardiac function with associated symptom and biochemical resolution.\nClinicians should be aware of this potentially fatal adverse effect of a commonly prescribed medication. Symptoms of myocarditis often occur within the early stages of mesalazine initiation, which aids the clinical diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is to simply discontinue the drug with rapid resolution of symptoms seen without any permanent or long-term cardiac dysfunction. Close liaison with the gastroenterology team is key, as 2nd line IBD therapies are often required for the ongoing management of the patient's colitis.\n\nTEXT:\nLearning points\n\nMesalazine can cause myocarditis early after initiation.\n\nClinicians should be aware of the non-infectious causes of myocarditis which would influence management.\n\nDiscontinuation of mesalazine remains the mainstay of treatment with cardiac dysfunction shown to return to baseline functioning.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMesalazine is an established 1st line therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is a common prescription due to a favourable safety profile with proven efficacy in active disease as well as maintaining remission and quiescence.1 Adverse side effects are rare but include agranulocytosis, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiac inflammation.2 Cardiotoxicity following administration of mesalazine is a potentially fatal complication with a reported incidence up to 0.3%.3,4 Myocarditis may also present as an extra-intestinal manifestation of IBD which can often be challenging to differentiate from 5-aminosalicyclic-acid (5-ASA)-induced myocarditis.

The pain was sharp in nature and exacerbated by deep inspiration and supine positioning. He also complained of preceding dyspnoea and general fatigue. There was no associated cough, fever, or coryzal prodrome. Past medical history included ulcerative colitis (UC) diagnosed at age 17. A watchful wait approach had been taken due to limited proctitis, however symptoms relapsed in the months prior to admission and he required multiple steroid courses. A repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy demonstrated active disease to the splenic flexure and a mesalazine preparation was commenced 12 days prior to presentation alongside a weaning course of steroids. Despite this, his colitis was still flaring on arrival to hospital with generalized abdominal pain, increased frequency, and bloody diarrhoea. Family history was strong for unprovoked deep vein thrombosis in his mother and maternal grandfather. Medication history on admission included mesalazine 1.6\u2009g b.i.d. and prednisolone 40\u2009mg.\n\nOn arrival, he was afebrile, normotensive with normal oxygen saturations. Cardio-respiratory examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray demonstrated clear lung fields. Blood profile revealed an elevated white cell count of 19.46 \u00d7 109/L (normal: 4\u201311 \u00d7 109/L), D-dimer of 1.81\u2009mg/L (normal: <0.50\u2009mg/L), troponin-T of 209\u2009ng/L (normal: <14ng/L), and normal serum electrolytes. Resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (Figure\u00a01) demonstrated sinus rhythm and concave ST-segment elevation in leads V4\u2013V6 with associated biphasic T-waves. He suffered ongoing chest pain during the first 24 h of presentation and repeat ECG (Figure\u00a02) demonstrated dynamic T-wave inversion in leads I, aVL, and V4\u2013V6. Repeat troponin-T was recorded at 242\u2009ng/L. He was initially treated as a suspected pulmonary embolus and transferred to the cardiology ward.\n\nFigure 1 Admission electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus rhythm with concave ST-elevation in V4\u2013V6 with associated biphasic T-waves.\n\nFigure 2 Electrocardiogram 24 h after admission demonstrating sinus rhythm with dynamic T-wave inversion in leads I, aVL, and V4\u2013V6.\n\nUpon review by the cardiology team, the working impression was a viral-induced myocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a non-dilated but severely impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function with global hypokinesia; mitral annular plane systolic excursion was reduced at 4\u2009mm (normal: \u226510 mm), mitral valve deceleration time was 121\u2009ms with an average e\u2032 of 7\u2009cm/s and E/e\u2032 of 13. Right ventricle was non-dilated with a preserved radial and longitudinal systolic function; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was 17\u2009mm (normal: \u226516\u2009mm) with a tricuspid annular systolic velocity of 12\u2009cm/s. No pericardial effusion or significant valve defects were seen (Video 1).\n\nFollowing the TTE findings, our patient was commenced and titrated on standard heart failure (HF) treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril 1.25\u2009mg) and a beta blocker (bisoprolol 2.5\u2009mg). He was clinically euvolaemic and did not require any diuretic therapy during his admission. The patient stabilized and was discharged with a planned early outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at the local tertiary centre and close HF clinic surveillance. His prednisolone remained at 40\u2009mg with a planned reduction of 5\u2009mg weekly.\n\nTen days following discharge, he was reviewed in the nurse-led HF clinic where he reported ongoing episodes of chest pain with a reduced exercise tolerance. His HF medications were up-titrated and shortly after, his mesalazine was discontinued after liaison with the gastroenterology team as the suspected causative agent to his myopericarditis. A further follow-up was arranged 10 days following mesalazine cessation where he reported a markedly improved exercise tolerance with milder episodes of chest pain. At the time, he was on a weaning regime of prednisolone at a dose of 20\u2009mg.\n\nCMR was conducted 2 weeks following cessation of mesalazine (6 weeks following admission) and demonstrated a normal biventricular systolic function with no myocardial scarring or fibrosis. No active myocardial inflammation was demonstrable with no abnormal elevation of T1 (980\u2009ms at 1.5\u2009T) or T2 values on T1 and T2 mapping (Figure\u00a03). Upper limit of normal value for our 1.5\u2009T Siemens Avanto magnetic resonance imaging scanner is 980\u2009ms and 60\u2009ms for T1 and T2 relaxation values respectively. A further consultation took place shortly after and the patient reported he was pain free, no longer breathless and exercise capacity had returned to baseline. Prednisolone dose had been further reduced and repeat ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with upright T-waves (Figure\u00a04) with troponin-T measuring <5 ng/L; signifying no ongoing myocardial inflammation. Surveillance echocardiogram 4 months later demonstrated an ongoing preserved and recovered LV systolic function (Video 2) and his IBD was now controlled on infliximab therapy.\n\nFigure 3 Cardiac magnetic resonance performed 2 weeks following discontinuation of mesalazine demonstrating no active myocarditis.

However, it is vital for clinicians to be aware of this adverse effect to allow prompt recognition and cessation of mesalazine prior to the development of any long-term dysfunction.\n\nIBD associated myocarditis involves an autoimmune response following autoantigen exposure,8 whereas the mechanism of mesalazine-induced cardiotoxicity is thought to be a cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction; supported by eosinophilic infiltration on endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) specimens, rapid recovery of symptoms following drug discontinuation and freedom from permanent sequalae.9\n\nDiagnosis of 5-ASA-induced myocarditis is based on clinical grounds; with symptom onset typically occurring within the first 2\u20134\u2009weeks of mesalazine initiation.10,11 Treatment is largely supportive with drug cessation being key with complete resolution of symptoms and cardiac dysfunction documented within the days following drug withdrawal.11,12 In addition, steroids are shown to aid and expedite myocardial recovery.13\n\nOur patient met the European Society of Cardiology Task Force criteria on the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis7 with an acute chest pain history, abnormal ECG, raised cardiac biomarkers, and LV systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram. However, he did not meet the Lake Louise Criteria (LLC) for myocarditis14 or demonstrate an abnormal elevation of T1 or T2 values on T1 and T2 mapping during CMR. We hypothesize that as the myocarditis driver was removed 2 weeks prior, this allowed resolution of the inflammation with a prompt return to baseline functioning as supported by the literature.9,11,12 This was possibly expedited by the concurrent steroid course he was prescribed for his colitis flare.13 Conversely, the time interval of 2 weeks following the acute myocarditis episode could also explain why LLC was negative.15\n\nIn our clinical case, the patient\u2019s myocarditis symptomatology was secondary to mesalazine rather than active IBD; supported by the onset of symptoms within the first 2 weeks of drug commencement and rapid resolution of symptoms with recovery of cardiac function soon after discontinuing mesalazine. Despite this, EMB remains the gold standard practice for the diagnosis of myocarditis to confirm the underlying aetiology and characteristics of inflammation; which influences the treatment approach and prognosis.7 Despite being the gold standard practice, EMB remains largely underutilized in the real world.\n\nConclusion\n\nClinicians should be aware of the non-infectious causes of myocarditis that would influence management and lead to resolution like this case. This clinical report highlights the important and potentially life-threatening complication of 5-ASA therapy which should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in patients who are on mesalazine presenting with chest pain or HF. Cessation of the drug should promptly follow, and other causes of myocarditis excluded. The mainstay of treatment remains to simply discontinue mesalazine, which leads to prompt and rapid recovery of symptoms and a return to baseline cardiac functioning. Close liaison with the gastroenterology team is required to ensure appropriate 2nd line therapy is initiated for the patient\u2019s ongoing colitis management.\n\nLead author biography\n\nDr Simran Shergill graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2015.

There is some evidence suggesting the occurrence of pancreatitis following TCZ use. We aimed to determine the reporting of pancreatitis following TCZ use in comparison with other drugs using the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. We extracted adverse event reports submitted to FAERS during 2013-2019. A reporting odds ratio (ROR) with the lower bound 95% confidence interval (CI) >\u20091 and a lower limit of a two-sided 95% interval of information component (IC025) more than zero was considered significant. Following deduplication, 3,383,910 adverse event reports were available; 144 (0.004%) reports were of pancreatic adverse events associated with TCZ use, and 15,907 (0.47%) associated with other drugs. Of the 144 cases, 74 (51.39%) received concomitant medications with pancreatotoxic potential. The likelihood of reporting of pancreatic events, compared with any other adverse event, with TCZ use was 1.32 times higher than that with other drugs. The lower bound of the 95% CI of the ROR and IC remained above the criteria of significance throughout the study period, except 2013. The findings suggest disproportionately high reporting of pancreatitis in patients receiving TCZ as compared with other drugs. This marginally high reporting is not likely to be of immediate clinical concern and needs to be interpreted cautiously.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nTocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody that acts by blocking IL-6/IL-6 receptor signaling1. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine released in response to infection, trauma, and immunologic challenge; it promotes activation of T and B cells2. TCZ is used for treating adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis; in children, 2\u00a0years of age or older, with polyarticular/systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis; in adults and children for cytokine release syndrome3. Because of its effectiveness in treating severe life-threatening cytokine release syndrome, TCZ has been recommended as an immunotherapy for patients with extensive lung lesions or severely ill patients with elevated IL-6 levels4. Also, preliminary studies have reported the use of intravenous and subcutaneous TCZ in reducing the risk of mechanical ventilation or death in severe pneumonia associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection5,6.\n\nSome of the common adverse effects of concern seen in clinical trials of TCZ are infections, abnormal liver function tests, neutropenia, anaphylaxis, arterial hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia7,8. Few studies have also reported the occurrence of acute pancreatitis with long term use of TCZ9\u201311. However, there is a paucity of data relating the occurrence of pancreatitis following TCZ use. A recent case report highlighted acute hypertriglyceridemia with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, consistent with acute pancreatitis, in patients with COVID\u201019 treated with TCZ12; hence, the long-term use of TCZ for systemic inflammatory disorders and acute use in a large population for COVID-19 necessitates the evaluation of the potential likelihood of pancreatitis, a condition with potentially serious health consequences, following its use.\n\nAdverse event databases form a good data source for the initial exploration of a link between a suspected drug and the adverse event13. Although the results are not confirmatory, they help decide whether resource-intensive interventions need to be employed to further explore the drug-adverse event relationship. In this study, using the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, we intend to determine whether pancreatitis is reported more often with TCZ use compared with other drugs, by performing a disproportionality analysis and describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of the cases. Increased reporting of pancreatitis following TCZ use indicates the need for a thorough investigation of the drug-adverse event link and continued monitoring and evaluation of such cases. One of the major drawbacks of the FAERS database is the presence of duplicate case reports. An as\u2013is use of the database without excluding duplicate reports is likely to significantly affect the study results14. We overcome this drawback by employing a deduplication procedure along with systematic extraction of cases with the drug-adverse event combination to enhance the data reliability.\n\nMethods\n\nThis was a retrospective database study; we used the United States FAERS, a database containing the adverse event reports submitted to FDA by sources such as healthcare professionals, consumers, and drug manufacturers15. The database has been used extensively for detecting potential drug safety issues. The study protocol was approved by Kasturba Medical College Institutional Ethics Committee (IECKMCMLR-08/2020/229), and since the FAERS is a public database containing de-identified data, the need for informed consent was waived.\n\nWe downloaded the quarterly raw data files of individual case safety reports (ICSR) in ASCII format for the period January 2013 to December 2019. We began with year 2013 since the FAERS was launched towards the end of 2012, replacing the legacy AERS system; also, the subcutaneous formulation of TCZ received approval in United States in 20133. The adverse event data of an ICSR are present in a set of seven files containing demographic information of the patient (DEMO), information regarding all the drugs reported for the event (DRUG), the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms coded for the adverse reactions (REAC), the adverse event outcome (OUTC), report source (RPSR), drug therapy start and end dates (THER), and the MedDRA terms coded for the indications for drug use (INDI)15. The data from the downloaded dollar sign-limited text files were imported into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for further processing.\n\nIn the FAERS, each ICSR is assigned a unique identification number (Primary ID), which is a concatenation of the case ID and the version history number. To avoid counting different versions (follow-up reports) of the same adverse event report, we performed deduplication as proposed by the FDA; this involves retaining only one version of the adverse event and excluding all other versions15. However, the same adverse event may be reported by different sources at different time periods, and the FDA processing logic may fail to identify the two reports as the same. For example, the same adverse event reported by both the patient and the drug manufacturer may be assigned different identification numbers, thereby erroneously increasing the number of events counted. One of the measures proposed to eliminate such duplicate cases is to look for matching information in multiple data fields in the ICSR. A proposed method for identifying duplicate cases is based on matching data in the event date, age, sex, and reporter country fields16. However, many case reports may have one or more of these fields empty, which increases the chances of these reports being considered a duplicate; for example, if all the data fields, except for the event date, are empty, two reports containing the same event date will be identified as duplicates. To overcome this problem, along with the abovementioned fields, we also included the suspect drug name(s) and the reaction(s) fields to match cases16. Further, to avoid missing detection of duplicates due to differences in the letter case, the order of drug names/reaction, presence of non-alphanumeric characters, we used a process of word concatenation, capitalization of letters, removal of non-alphabetical characters, and sorting of this concatenated data alphabetically using the functionalities in Microsoft Excel program to improve detection of duplicate data. The initial deduplication based on the case identification numbers was performed using the DEMO files. We added the data from the drug and reaction fields (extracted from DRUG and REAC files), after processing them as mentioned above, into the DEMO file to perform the second deduplication step of comparing multiple data fields. This deduplicated list of ICSRs was then used to extract the relevant data and perform the disproportionality analysis.\n\nFollowing deduplication, we searched for adverse event reports of pancreatitis using the following MedDRA terminology preferred terms: pancreatic duct obstruction; obstructive pancreatitis; immune-mediated pancreatitis; pancreatic toxicity; oedematous pancreatitis; pancreatic necrosis; pancreatic duct stenosis; pancreatic infarction; ischaemic pancreatitis; pancreatitis; pancreatitis acute; pancreatitis haemorrhagic; pancreatitis necrotising; hemorrhagic necrotic pancreatitis; pancreatic failure; and pancreatic haemorrhage. We chose these terms based on a literature search to identify the various adverse event and pathological terms used in the published literature to describe the toxic effects of drugs on pancreas17\u201319.\n\nWe also searched for adverse events reported by doctors, pharmacists, or other healthcare professionals where TCZ was mentioned as the primary or secondary suspect medication for the reported event. The brand names as well as the generic name, i.e. Tocilizumab, Actemra, Actemra actpen, and Roactemra, were used to search for the relevant cases. Reports which included at least one of the preferred terms for pancreatitis and listed TCZ as a primary or secondary suspect medication were assumed to be cases of TCZ-induced pancreatitis. We also recorded the number of adverse events other than pancreatitis that were reported with TCZ. Similarly, we determined the number of cases of pancreatitis reported in association with all other drugs in the FAERS database, other than TCZ, and the total number of other adverse events reported during the study period. Since many other drugs have pancreatotoxic potential, we noted the concomitant medications received by the cases; we determined the number of cases with use of such pancreatotoxic concomitant medications. The classification proposed by Badalov et al. was used to identify the pancreatotoxic drugs20.\n\nDisproportionality analysis\n\nA disproportionality analysis determines whether there is disproportional reporting of a drug-adverse event combination compared with the occurrence of the adverse event with other drugs in the database21. Our study objective was to determine whether the reporting of pancreatitis was disproportionately high in association with TCZ use. The disproportionality methods used in our study are the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) with shrinkage, which are commonly used data mining methods for signal detection22\u201324. The calculation of disproportionality measures is based on a two-by-two contingency table (Supplementary Table S1)21. ROR is the ratio of the odds of an adverse event in those who did by those who did not receive the suspected medication. IC involves the calculation of the observed to expected ratio; since it may provide erroneous results when the observed or expected number is extremely low, a shrinkage factor is applied to the numerator and denominator which moderates the measure towards a null value in the absence of a true difference (Supplementary Table S1). A ROR with the lower bound 95% confidence interval (CI) >\u20091 and a lower limit of a two-sided 95% interval of IC (IC025) more than zero was considered significant, indicating that the number of events (pancreatitis) observed with the suspect drug (tocilizumab) is more than the number expected by chance alone22,24. Disproportionality analysis was conducted for pancreatitis inclusive of all the preferred terms and also for each preferred term when the number of cases was \u2265\u20095.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe clinical and demographic characteristics of the cases with suspected TCZ-induced pancreatitis have been reported as median (interquartile range [IQR]) since the data were not normally distributed (Shapiro\u2013Wilk test, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Categorical variables are reported as proportion and percentage. The descriptive statistics were calculated using Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).\n\nResults\n\nDuring the period 2013\u20132019, 9,122,256 adverse event reports were received by FAERS. Following case deduplication, the total number of reports was 3,383,910. Among these, 144 (0.004%) case reports were of pancreatic adverse events associated with TCZ use, and 15,907 (0.47%) associated with use of other drugs. Apart from the pancreatic adverse events, 22,899 other adverse events were reported with TCZ as a primary or secondary suspect medication.\n\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the 144 cases of pancreatic adverse events associated with TCZ use are shown in Table 1. The median age of the patients was 56\u00a0years (IQR, 45.75\u201366.50); females represented 53% of the cases. The most common reported pancreatic adverse event was pancreatitis. Majority of the cases fulfilled the criteria for a serious adverse event. The median duration of onset from the time of initiation of TCZ was 4\u00a0months (IQR, 1\u201310.75). Concomitant medications were reported in 107 cases, and among these, 74 (51.39%) patients received drugs that can cause pancreatitis; 38 patients received more than one such drug, besides TCZ (Table 2). Among the 21 countries which reported TCZ-associated pancreatic events to FAERS, the highest number was reported from the United States (19%).Table 1 Characteristics of cases with pancreatic adverse events following tocilizumab use.\n\nCharacteristics\tValue\t\nAge, median (IQR)\t\nAll\t56 (45.75\u201366.50)\t\nMale\t56 (43\u201370)\t\nFemale\t56.5 (48.50\u201366.50)\t\nGender, N (%)\t\nMale\t47 (32.64)\t\nFemale\t76 (52.78)\t\nNot specified\t21 (14.58)\t\nAdverse event outcome, N (%)\t\nDied\t14 (9.72)\t\nHospitalized\t85 (59.03)\t\nLife threatening\t2 (1.39)\t\nOther outcomes\t43 (29.86)\t\nAdverse event terms, N (%)a\t\nPancreatitis\t90 (62.50)\t\nPancreatitis acute\t35 (24.31)\t\nPancreatic toxicity\t8 (5.56)\t\nPancreatic failure\t6 (4.17)\t\nPancreatic necrotising\t5 (3.47)\t\nPancreatic necrosis\t1 (0.69\t\nPancreatitis haemorrhagic\t1 (0.69)\t\nPancreatolithiasis\t1 (0.69)\t\nReporting country, N (%)\t\nUnited States\t27 (18.75)\t\nCanada\t23 (15.97)\t\nGermany\t25 (17.36)\t\nFrance\t19 (13.19)\t\nJapan\t10 (6.94)\t\nUnited Kingdom\t8 (5.56)\t\nOthers\t32 (22.22)\t\nMedications, N (%)\t\nTocilizumab only\t37 (25.69)\t\nTocilizumab\u2009+\u2009other drugs\t107 (74.31)\t\nTocilizumab\u2009+\u2009other pancreatotoxic drugs\t74 (51.39)\t\naTotal count exceeds 144 since three reports contained two adverse event terms each.\n\nTable 2 Concomitant drugs with potential to cause pancreatitis received by patients with tocilizumab-associated pancreatic adverse events20.\n\nClass Ia\tClass Ib\tClass II\tClass III\tClass IV\t\nCodeine\tAzathioprine\tAcetaminophen\tAlendronate\tCyclophosphamide\t\nEnalapril\tDexamethasone\tAsparaginase\tAtorvastatin\tDiclofenac\t\nFurosemide\tEthinyl estradiol\tPropofol\tCeftriaxone\tKetoprofen\t\nMesalamine\tLosartan\t\tCyclosporine\tLovastatin\t\nMetronidazole\tMercaptopurine\t\tHydrochlorothiazide\tRamipril\t\nSimvastatin\tOmeprazole\t\tIndomethacin\tRitonavir\t\nValproic acid\tConjugated estrogens\t\tLisinopril\tRosuvastatin\t\n\tCotrimoxazole\t\tMetformin\tTacrolimus\t\n\t\t\tNaproxen\t\t\n\t\t\tPrednisone\t\t\n\t\t\tPrednisolone\t\t\nThe drugs have been listed in a particular class based on the classification of drugs causing acute pancreatitis suggested by Badalov et al.20, which is based on the level of evidence available.\n\nThe disproportionality analysis results are shown in Table 3. The ROR and IC for the entire study data, considering all the reported pancreatic adverse event terms together, fulfilled the significance criteria for disproportionality. The likelihood of reporting of pancreatic events, compared with any other adverse event, with TCZ use was 1.32 times higher than that with other drugs; the Bayesian IC also indicates that the reporting of the drug-adverse event combination of interest is slightly higher than that expected when there is no association between the drug and event. On analyzing individual pancreatic adverse event terms, the disproportionality statistic, both ROR and IC, for the terms pancreatic toxicity, pancreatitis, and pancreatic failure were significant. While there were 90 cases of pancreatitis reported during the study period, there were only 8 and 6 cases of pancreatic toxicity and pancreatic failure, respectively, associated with TCZ use. The highest number of cases were reported to FAERS in 2018; the disproportionality analysis for each year is shown in Table 4. The IC025 was below the criteria of significance for all the years, except 2016. In contrast, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of ROR was above the criteria of significance for all the years, except 2017 and 2019. However, the magnitude of increased reporting was less than twice the number that would be expected in the absence of any association between the drug and the adverse event.Table 3 Disproportionality analysis for pancreatitis associated with tocilizumab use.\n\nMedDRA term (notation)\tROR\t95% CI\tIC\t95% CI\t\nPancreatitis [all terms]\t1.32\t1.12\u20131.56a\t0.39\t0.12\u20130.59a\t\nPancreatitis (10033645)\t1.38\t1.12\u20131.70a\t0.45\t0.11\u20130.71a\t\nPancreatitis acute (10033647)\t0.93\t0.66\u20131.29\t\u2212\u20090.11\t\u2212\u20090.67 to 0.29\t\nPancreatic toxicity (10076205)\t53.06\t23.62\u2013119.18a\t3.59\t2.38\u20134.40a\t\nPancreatic failure (10079281)\t5.72\t2.53\u201312.94a\t2.04\t0.62\u20132.95a\t\nPancreatitis necrotising (10033654)\t1.78\t0.74\u20134.31\t0.73\t\u2212\u20090.83 to 1.71\t\nCI confidence interval, IC information component, MedDRA medical dictionary for regulatory activities, ROR reporting odds ratio.\n\naStatistically significant.\n\nTable 4 Year-wise disproportionality analysis for pancreatitis associated with tocilizumab use.\n\nYear\tNumber of cases\tROR\t95% CI\tIC\t95% CI\t\n2013\t19\t1.64\t1.04\u20132.59a\t0.68\t\u2212\u20090.09 to 1.24\t\n2014\t16\t1.70\t1.04\u20132.79a\t0.73\t\u2212\u20090.12 to 1.33\t\n2015\t18\t1.76\t1.10\u20132.80a\t0.77\t\u2212\u20090.02 to 1.35\t\n2016\t23\t1.83\t1.21\u20132.77a\t0.84\t0.14\u20131.35a\t\n2017\t21\t1.28\t0.83\u20131.96\t0.34\t\u2212\u20090.39 to 0.87\t\n2018\t31\t1.49\t1.04\u20132.12a\t0.55\t\u2212\u20090.05 to 0.99\t\n2019\t16\t0.64\t0.39\u20131.04\t\u2212\u20090.63\t\u2212\u20091.47 to \u2212\u20090.02\t\nCI confidence interval, IC information component, ROR reporting odds ratio.\n\naStatistically significant.\n\nTo determine the change in the disproportionality statistics over time, we calculated the cumulative ROR and IC over time, from 2013 to 2019 (Fig.\u00a01). The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the ROR remained above 1 throughout the study period, with a progressive narrowing of the confidence intervals. A similar trend is seen with regard to IC025 with the exception that the lower bound of the 2013 IC was below the criteria of significance. To determine the disproportionality results in the absence of deduplication, we performed an unplanned analysis of the FAERS raw data by running multiple drug and adverse event search term queries (considering all pancreatic adverse event terms together) in the FAERS public dashboard25; the resultant ROR was 2.07 (1.82\u20132.35) and IC 1.03 (0.82\u20131.19). We then used AERSMine data mining software program to determine if the concomitant administration of pancreatotoxic drugs, other than TCZ, had an influence on the disproportionality results26. AERSMine program performs ontological aggregation of the various drug names, disease conditions, and adverse event terms26. The program also allows dividing the cases into cohorts based on drugs received/to be excluded, adverse events of interest, etc. We divided the cases in to those who received TCZ but not any of the other potentially pancreatotoxic drugs and those who received TCZ with at least one of the pancreatotoxic drugs. The resultant ROR and IC for those who did versus those who did not receive concomitant pancreatotoxic drug(s) were 0.95 (0.79\u20131.14) and \u2212\u20090.07 (\u2212\u20090.37 to 0.14) versus 1.48 (1.19\u20131.83) and 0.55 (0.19\u20130.81), respectively.Figure 1 Cumulative change in the reporting odds ratio (ROR) (a) and information component (IC) (b) values for suspected tocilizumab-induced pancreatitis reported to United States food and drug administration adverse event database from 2013 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur analysis of the FAERS database for the period 2013\u20132019 showed that the reporting of pancreatitis in association with TCZ use was marginally higher, less than double the number, compared with that in association with other drugs in the database. The disproportionality analysis shows that the marginally higher reporting has remained at almost the same level during the 7-year period studied, with a gradual narrowing of the confidence intervals. Our study data shows that the disproportionality statistic was higher in the pre-2017 period27, albeit with a wider confidence interval. Considering the large number of patients exposed to the drug every year, this small but significant disproportionality finding is important, but at the same time, this needs to be considered taking into account the inherent limitations of data obtained from adverse event databases such as FAERS used in the current study15,28. It is also to be noted that the results did not show increased reporting of acute pancreatitis, which is more likely to be drug-related, with TCZ.\n\nPancreatitis is a serious condition with significant potential morbidity and mortality. Drugs are a relatively rare cause of acute pancreatitis, responsible for 3\u20135% of the cases17,29\u201331. Most drug-induced pancreatitis cases are mild to moderate in severity; however, failure to implicate a drug as a causative agent can result in serious complications27. A 52-week clinical, functional, and radiographic efficacy and safety study of TCZ in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as a few case reports have reported the occurrence of pancreatitis9\u201311,32. In contrast, retrospective cohort studies have shown that rheumatoid arthritis by itself can increase the risk of acute pancreatitis, irrespective of the use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, which makes ascertaining the cause more difficult33,34. Other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, have also been shown to cause pancreatitis, although uncommon, and the reported estimates are likely to be highly variable35. The mechanism by which drugs, in general, cause pancreatitis is not clearly understood. A number of mechanisms have been postulated, such as direct cytotoxic tissue injury36; indirect metabolic effects such as hypercalcemia and hypertriglyceridemia37,38; idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity reactions39; localized angioedema40; arteriolar thrombosis37. The exact mechanism for acute pancreatitis with TCZ is unknown, but it may be due to hypertriglyceridemia and IL-6 inhibition11. The likely duration of treatment with TCZ for onset of pancreatitis is unclear. In a study by Flaig et al.11, pancreatitis occurred after the administration of second dose, where the first dose was given 2\u00a0weeks before the second dose. In a case report by Alfreijat et al.32, TCZ was given 3\u00a0months before the onset of hepatitis and mild pancreatitis at a dose of 8\u00a0mg/kg/month, with the last injection 1\u00a0week before the hospitalization. One more case report described increased serum triglyceride levels and acute pancreatitis biomarkers on the third day of treatment with TCZ used to treat COVID-19 infection12. Hence, with the available studies, it is difficult to rule out the possibility of acute pancreatitis when TCZ is used for a short duration as for treating COVID-19 infection. In the current study, the median duration of onset was 4\u00a0months; however, data was missing or incomplete for a large number of cases.\n\nOur study results show that TCZ-associated pancreatitis was reported more in females, although the validity of this finding cannot be confirmed, considering the wide range of factors that influence adverse event spontaneous reporting. There is some evidence, however, that females may be affected more often29,41. Majority of the reported cases were serious adverse events, with approximately 10% mortality. However, many of these patients had comorbid events which could have contributed to the case severity and outcome. In addition, approximately 51% of the cases received concomitant medications with a pancreatotoxic potential. Although the presence of concomitant medication with pancreatotoxic potential makes it difficult to attribute the adverse events to TCZ alone, our analysis using AERSMine26 showed that disproportionate reporting was seen only in the cohort who received TCZ without concomitant pancreatotoxic drugs. Badalov et al. proposed a 4-class classification of drugs implicated in causing pancreatitis20. Accordingly, TCZ may be classified as a class II drug, in which 75% of at least four reported case reports describe a latency period and no rechallenge has been done42; 16 reported concomitant medications belonged to class I.\n\nWe used the ROR, a frequentist approach, and IC, a Bayesian approach, to determine the statistical significance of the obtained results. While each approach has specific advantages and disadvantages, both the statistic are expected to provide congruent results43. This is true in our study where both the disproportionality measures show a small, but significant, disproportionately higher reporting of pancreatitis in patients who received TCZ. While the cumulative change in the disproportionality measures in our study show the gradual decrease in the confidence interval with a significant statistic, the yearly analysis shows that both measures fulfilled the criteria of significance only in the year 2016. This may be due to the small overall number of cases reported each year, resulting in a wide confidence interval, which failed to meet the significance criteria. The fact that the significance criteria was met for only one year as per IC and four of the studied years as per ROR highlights the possible differences in the interpretation of the data in situations where the number of events reported is low relative to the database size based on the disproportionality measure adopted. ROR has been adopted as the disproportionality statistic by the EudraVigilance system based on the findings of the PROTECT project22, while IC is the disproportionality statistic used by World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre23. ROR has the advantage of simplicity and easier understanding of the output whereas IC avoids overestimation of results/spurious results in situations where the expected and observed counts are small44. Despite the differences, all disproportionality statistic are based on a two-by-two contingency table, and largely provide similar results, with the choice of a particular statistic being dictated by the availability of resources, implementation, and the choice of communication of results43.\n\nThe presence of duplicate case reports is common and can significantly affect the disproportionality analysis outcomes45. We used the routine deduplication procedure based on case IDs supplemented with checking of matching data in multiple fields of the case report; however, this procedure does not identify duplicate reports that do not contain matching data due to spelling errors or exclusion/inclusion of drug names/event terms by two reporters reporting the same event. In fact, we did find potentially duplicate cases among the 144 cases obtained after deduplication; for example, multiple potential duplicate cases of a pancreatic failure event were identified, each case differing due to mismatch in one data field. While we manually processed each data file using the functionalities in MS Excel, other more automated but technically complex procedures have been described and implemented16, including an algorithm that can potentially overcome the aforementioned limitations46. To identify the magnitude by which our results differ from the analysis of the unprocessed data from the raw files, we performed an analysis using the FAERS public dashboard; as expected, both the ROR and IC were much higher than that obtained following deduplication. We extracted the cases reporting the drug-adverse event pair and subjected it to deduplication procedure adopted in the current study. This resulted in the final number of cases (i.e. 144) same as that obtained from deduplication of data from the raw files, confirming the accuracy of the procedure. There are inherent limitations of FAERS such as potential underreporting, the influence of publicity regarding an event, possible reporting errors, incomplete information, etc.15. Hence, the findings cannot be considered confirmatory.\n\nTo conclude, our study findings show that there is disproportionately high reporting of pancreatitis, in comparison to other adverse events, in patients receiving TCZ as compared with other drugs. However, the increased reporting is only marginally high, less than twice the number that would be expected if there is no association between the drug and the adverse event. Given the limitations of the study and the FAERS data, this marginally high reporting is not likely to be of immediate clinical concern and needs to be interpreted cautiously. Monitoring the future trends of disproportionality and published reports of pancreatitis following TCZ use are required to confirm the findings.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Table S1.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-021-98325-w.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nA.K. conceived the study protocol with inputs from S.A., R.R. and S.U.

We report on 10 non-small cell lung cancer patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia who experienced immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia. The immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia lasted for a median duration of 41.5\u2009days (range\u2009=\u200922-127\u2009days). Eight of the ten patients responded to corticosteroid monotherapy; one patient responded to corticosteroids and the immunosuppressant, tacrolimus; and one patient did not improve after corticosteroid treatment. In non-small cell lung cancer patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia, immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia was generally responds to corticosteroids.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors can cause immune-related adverse events, including interstitial pneumonia. 1 In phase III trials, the incidence of interstitial pneumonia in non-small cell lung cancer patients was 3.8% (n\u2009=\u2009287) with nivolumab, 2 5.8% (n\u2009=\u2009154) with pembrolizumab, 3 and 2.3% (n\u2009=\u2009609) with atezolizumab. 4 However, patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia were excluded from these clinical trials. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are rarely administered to lung cancer patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia. However, some patients with non-small cell lung cancer and a history of mild idiopathic interstitial pneumonia have been treated with nivolumab.5,6 Nonetheless, there are few reports of the effectiveness of corticosteroids for immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia among patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia, particularly in patients who were treated with atezolizumab and pembrolizumab. Therefore, we report on the effectiveness of corticosteroid treatment in 10 non-small cell lung cancer patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia who subsequently re-experienced immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia.\n\nCase discussion\n\nPatients\n\nThe study was conducted in the Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital. The study period lasted from December 2015 to March 2020. Patients, who had non-small cell lung cancer with a history of interstitial pneumonia, were included in the study. Patients were treated with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab. We surveyed 183 patients.\n\nOf the 183 patients surveyed, 10 patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia experienced immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia. The patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. All 10 patients had a history of smoking. One patient received combination therapy, whereas nine patients were treated with single-agent corticosteroid regimens. Four patients had radiation pneumonitis, without radiation fibrosis; four patients had interstitial pneumonia secondary to immune checkpoint inhibitors; and two patients had idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The condition of four patients (cases 2, 5, 6, and 7) with a history of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia had previously improved. However, when rechallenged with immune checkpoint inhibitors, these four patients suffered from immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia again.\n\nTable 1.

One patient responded to a combination of corticosteroids and the immunosuppressant tacrolimus. One patient did not improve after corticosteroid treatment and died, with persistent interstitial pneumonia as the probable cause of death.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTen non-small cell lung cancer patients experienced immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia. Among them, eight responded well to corticosteroid monotherapy.\n\nThese cases indicate the effectiveness of corticosteroids against immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia among patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia. Interstitial pneumonia can have severe outcomes, including death. In this case series, interstitial pneumonia was the probable cause of death in one patient. On the basis of their risks and benefits, immune checkpoint inhibitors should be considered for non-small cell cancer patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer with interstitial pneumonia or active radiation pneumonia have been excluded from phase III trials.1\u20134 Therefore, it is necessary to consider the appropriateness of immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment among patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia. 7 Similarly in Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, which controls the approval and proper use of medicines, has warned against the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors to patients with, or with a history of, interstitial pneumonia.\n\nAmong 20 patients who developed interstitial lung disease due to anti-bodies against the programmed cell death-1 ligand, 18 patients had idiopathic organizing pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonia. 8 There were only two cases of acute interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that were unresponsive to corticosteroids. In that study, 8 two patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia had melanoma and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Our case series differs from the previous study because it only includes patients with non-small cell lung cancer and interstitial pneumonia.\n\nIn a review of interstitial pneumonia caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors, 9 organizing pneumonia pattern (23%), hypersensitivity pneumonia pattern (16%), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (8%), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial pneumonia (6%), and an unidentifiable pattern (36%) were reported. There is no report of acute interstitial pneumonia that is refractory to corticosteroids. Similarly, in our case series, there were no patients with acute interstitial pneumonia. Corticosteroids may be able to control immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia among patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia.\n\nThere are a limited number of case reports on the use of corticosteroids to treat patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia and a history of interstitial pneumonia. This was a retrospective study and the histopathological classification of the interstitial pneumonia was not determined as this was a case series involving a limited number of cases in a single facility. Our case series contained patients with a history of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. We did not determine the severity of interstitial pneumonia. Immune checkpoint inhibitors should be considered a cause of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia among patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia. In the future, we would like to compare patients with and without exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia following the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors among patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn non-small cell lung cancer patients with a history of interstitial pneumonia, immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial pneumonia generally responded well to corticosteroids.\n\nThe authors thank Editage (www.editage.com) for English language editing.\n\nDeclaration of conflicting interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nEthical approval: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital, based on the ethical guidelines for medical and health research involving human subjects (approval no. 20H034).\n\nFunding: The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nInformed consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient(s) for their anonymized information to be published.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nRecurrence of Disseminated Mycobacterium avium intracellulare Presenting as Spondylodiscitis and Epidural Abscess in a Patient with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n\nABSTRACT:\nBACKGROUND Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAI) is a member of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria family, which can cause both pulmonary and non-pulmonary disease. In patients with advanced HIV, it is known to cause disseminated disease. We present a case of a 65-year-old man who has sex with men (MSM) with AIDS, found to have spondylodiscitis and an epidural abscess, who had recently completed treatment for disseminated MAI. CASE REPORT The patient was a 65-year-old with AIDS secondary to HIV and a prior history of disseminated MAI, who presented with severe back pain. Upon presentation to the hospital, an MRI was performed, which was suggestive of spondylodiscitis and an epidural abscess. He was taken to surgery for a minimally invasive T12-L1 laminectomy and evacuation of the epidural abscess. Both traditional cultures and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) cultures were negative. Due to worsening pain, he was taken back to surgery for a repeat debridement and biopsy. Repeat cultures were positive for MAI. He was started on rifabutin, ethambutol, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin was subsequently discontinued. He has had problems tolerating the treatment regimen, but is planned to complete an 18-24-month course. CONCLUSIONS For patients with AIDS who have a diagnosis of spondylodiscitis and an epidural abscess, an opportunistic infection such as MAI should be considered. A repeat biopsy should be considered if suspicion is still high, even despite initially negative cultures. Treatment regimens should be prolonged, despite difficulty with medication compliance.\n\nTEXT:\nBackground\n\nDisseminated MAI is a clinical diagnosis which is distinctive from pulmonary MAI, both in terms of risk factors and clinical presentation [1,2]. Pulmonary MAI often occurs in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients, and structural lung disease is a risk factor [1]. Disseminated MAI tends to occur in those with profound immunosuppression [1]. Patients with AIDS, particularly those with a CD 4 <50 cells/uL, are at high risk for disseminated MAI [2]. In such patients with advanced immunosuppression, MAI disease often is a disseminated, multi-organism infection [2]. Disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), including MAI, have been documented to cause vertebral osteomyelitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients [3\u20135]. Here, we present a case of a 65-year-old MSM with a history of AIDS who was found to have spondylodiscitis and an epidural abscess secondary to recurrent and disseminated MAI.\n\nCase Report\n\nIn October 2019, our patient presented to the Emergency Department with a chief concern of progressive low back pain which had developed over the preceding 2 weeks. He had initially been diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1984; since then, he had been intermittently compliant with antiretroviral therapy, with lapses while struggling with depression. He moved from Florida to Michigan in 2015. Prior to 2015, his history included HIV wasting syndrome, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, oral candidiasis, and chronic kidney disease stage 3 due to tenofovir, arterionephrosclerosis, and hepatitis C, which has since been treated. He had been off antiretroviral therapy from 2012 to 2015 due to a lack of follow-up.\n\nHe was previously diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia in May 2015 and had acid-fast bacillus (AFB) blood cultures turn positive after discharge. During this period, he moved from Florida to Michigan in September 2015, and repeat AFB blood cultures were negative. As previous records were not initially available at the time of presentation in August 2015, he was re-started on anti-retroviral therapy and prophylactic azithromycin for MAI prophylaxis in accordance with previous guidelines, as his CD4 count was <50 cells/uL [6]. After his CD4 count had increased to over 100 cells/uL, the azithromycin was discontinued. Over the last 2 years prior to this admission, his CD4 count had fluctuated from 75 to 190 cells/uL, and was rarely above 200 cells/uL. It had risen from 91 cells/uL to 206 cells/uL over the previous 6 months. Current antiviral regimen included darunavir-cobicistat (800 mg and 150 mg, respectively) daily, dolutegravir 50 mg daily, and lamivudine 100 mg daily. He had previously been on tenofovir, but this was discontinued due to a rising creatinine level. Abacavir was also contraindicated, given that he was HLA-B5701-positive [7]. He was also prescribed dapsone 100 mg daily for pneumocystis prophylaxis, but not trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole due to his elevated creatinine level.\n\nSince moving to Michigan, he had been compliant with his medications until late 2017. At that time, he presented again for pneumocystis pneumonia and tested positive again for MAI. Given his improving clinical status and negative repeat test in December 2017, treatment was again deferred. In June 2018 he developed hypercalcemia. Although his repeat test was negative, there was a high suspicion that disseminated MAI and possibly related granulomatous diseases was likely the cause of his hypercalcemia. Thus, he was started on azithromycin 500 mg daily and ethambutol 800 mg daily. The isolate for mycobacterium avium complex was tested for susceptibility and was found to be macrolide-susceptible. A 2-drug regimen was prescribed based on CDC/NIH/HIVMA guidelines for patients with CD >50 cells/uL and low levels of bacteremia (based on negative repeat cultures) [6]. A 3-drug regimen was considered, but deferred due to his history of medication non-compliance. The hypercalcemia resolved and he completed a 12-month course of 2-drug therapy for MAI.\n\nJust prior to his admission, he reported back pain prior to an anal biopsy, which found several high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The biopsy was performed secondary to ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) on a screening anal PAP exam. There was no reported history of trauma. He denied fever, chills, night sweats, trauma, and bowel or bladder incontinence. He admitted to new-onset flank pain. He was afebrile and normotensive with a BMI of 25. The exam showed a chronically ill-appearing man with intact strength and sensation in bilateral lower extremities, 2+patellar and 1+ankle reflexes bilaterally, as well as point tenderness at T12-L1. Pertinent labs include WBC 8500 uL (4500\u201311 000 uL), Hgb 12.2 g/dL (14\u201318 dL), MCV 100.2 fL (80\u2013100 fL), Creatinine 1.6 mg/dL (baseline 1.6\u20131.8mg/dL, normal range 0.7\u20131.2 mg/dL), ESR 102mm/h (0\u201320 mm/h), and CRP 2.1mg/dL (<0.5 mg/dL). An MRI spine screen was performed, demonstrating a new pathologic T12 fracture, marrow edema of T12-L1 vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc, suggesting spondylodiscitis, and a ventral epidural abscess at T12-L1 (Figure 1). He was started empirically on intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin, which was administered before blood cultures were collected. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital with Infectious Disease and Neurosurgery consultations.\n\nHis admission blood cultures remained negative. Due to worsening pain and for diagnosis, the patient underwent minimally invasive right T12-L1 laminectomy/medial facetectomy and evacuation of epidural abscess. Postoperatively, ceftriaxone and vancomycin were continued. Surgical cultures collected intraoperatively, including AFB cultures, were negative, and the biopsies taken were non-diagnostic, only showing necrotic tissue with rare neutrophils. Brucella testing was not performed due to low suspicion and a lack of exposure history. During this time the patient continued to have significant back pain and was not improving clinically. Secondary to cultures being negative, antimicrobial therapy was stopped for 7 days to optimize culture yield and he then underwent left a T12\u2013L1 open laminectomy with resection of epidural tissue and extensive T12, L1 vertebral body sampling, T12\u2013L1 interspace sampling with T11\u2013L3 and onlay fusion, and T11\u2013L3 pedicle screw fixation. The repeat biopsy demonstrated necrotizing granulomatous inflammation (Figure 2) and the AFB culture grew MAI.\n\nIn terms of a workup for further dissemination, a CT abdomen and pelvis, performed secondary to his flank pain, was suggestive of a large calculus at the right ureteropelvic junction without hydronephrosis. The calculus was managed medically without urologic intervention. He also had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy due to melena, which was diagnostic for a hiatal hernia, gastritis, gastric erosions, esophagitis, and esophageal ulcer. The biopsy was negative for candida, CMV, and HSV esophagitis.\n\nTreatment\n\nWe presumed the possibility of tuberculosis or resistant MAI, and thus patient was started on isoniazid 300 mg daily, azithromycin 500 mg daily, ethambutol 800 mg daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, and rifabutin 300 mg daily, pending antimicrobial sensitivities, and was continued on previously prescribed dapsone and his antiviral regimen. An AFB culture was positive for MAI, but the isolate was deemed non-viable for susceptibility testing. Upon identification of MAI, the isoniazid was discontinued. The patient initially did not tolerate this initial regimen, developing refractory nausea and vomiting, believed to be secondary to rifabutin, which was discontinued and subsequently resulted in symptom resolution. Within a few more weeks, he again developed refractory nausea and vomiting, at which time moxifloxacin was stopped, again with resolution of symptoms. Out of the desire to have the patient on a 3-drug regimen, 1 month later rifabutin was resumed at a lower dose and to date this regimen has been tolerated well. He has continued on azithromycin 500 mg daily, ethambutol 800 mg daily, and rifabutin 150 mg 3 times per week.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMAI is found in water and soil environments, with water being the main source of infection due to innate chloride resistance [2]. The pathogenesis of MAI in AIDS patients is believed to be secondary to gastrointestinal colonization and subsequent invasion across the mucosa and submucosa [2]. The present patient had a history of disseminated MAI, likely secondary to his immunosuppression from AIDS. Macrolide-based treatment courses for at least 12 months have been successful in several case series, particularly with recovery of CD4 cell counts [8\u201310]. Although rare, relapses have been documented, including one case with osteomyelitis [9]. Despite being treated for 12 months, we believe he likely had residual infection which presented as spondylodiscitis and an epidural abscess. Complicating his course was an inability of his CD4 cell count to consistently rise >200 cells/uL.\n\nMycobacterium avium complex has been documented to cause spondylodiscitis, both in HIV and non-HIV patients [3\u20135]. Among mycobacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been well-documented to cause spondylodiscitis [10]. Other cases of NTM include M. xenopi, M. abscessus, M. chelonae, M. fortuitum, M. kansasii, M. siniae, and M. flavescens [3]. The majority of these cases were either immunocompromised or on immunosuppressive medication, including steroids [3\u20135]. One series noted that 14.5% of patients with NTM vertebral osteomyelitis were positive for HIV [3]. Immune reconstitution may contribute to diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, as patients were diagnosed an average of 12.5 months from initiation of antiretroviral therapy [3]. We speculate that immune reconstitution may have contributed to his presentation, given that his CD4 had risen steadily over the previous 6 months. Complicating factors for our patient included intermittent compliance with his antiretroviral therapy. An epidural abscess is an even rarer complication of disseminated MAI [3]. It has been previously documented in M. tuberculosis [12].\n\nDiagnosing spondylosicitis and epidural abscess frequently requires a surgical biopsy, particularly if blood cultures are negative for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, or Brucella [13]. In the case of this patient, his blood cultures, which were drawn after antibiotics were initiated, were negative. Previous cases of MAI spondylosicitis frequently required a surgical biopsy, with AFB cultures being the primary diagnostic test [3,4]. Given the high suspicion for an opportunistic pathogen, the patient was taken to the operating room for a biopsy, including AFB and fungal cultures, and drainage of the epidural abscess. Due to negative cultures and the patient\u2019s lack of improvement, he was taken back to surgery for a second biopsy and drainage of the abscess. A few cases in the medical literature required 2 biopsies, but at least 1 case was secondary to a lack of initial AFB cultures due to low suspicion [4].\n\nIn terms of treatment, the Infectious Diseases Society of America treatment guidelines recommend 3-drug therapy for pulmonary disease, with a strong emphasis on a macrolide and ethambutol [14]. Similarly, treatment for disseminated MAI, which this likely represents, often may include rifampin, rifabutin, clofazimine, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides [2,6]. This patient was previously treated with 12 months of therapy for MAI. Previously successful regimens for vertebral osteomyelitis were similar to those prescribed for disseminated MAI [3,4]. NTM spondylodiscitis patients improved in approximately 80% of cases [3]. A case review of 16 non-HIV vertebral osteomyelitis secondary to MAI found that 68.8% of patients improved with therapy [4], with a mean duration of 16.8 months.\n\nOur patient had difficulty tolerating rifabutin and, subsequently, moxifloxacin. We did not use rifampin due to potential drug-drug interactions with the protease inhibitor. As previously noted, he has been on darunavir-cobicistat, dolutegravir, and lamivudine for antiretroviral therapy. After considerable encouragement, he resumed the rifabutin and has mostly been compliant, but has had lapses in his MAI therapy. Based on our previous literature review [4], we opted to continue him on 3-drug therapy for his spondylosicitis and epidural abscess. Given that he relapsed despite 12 months of therapy and intermittent compliance, we will aim to treat him for at least 18\u201324 months.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur patient with AIDS and disseminated MAI presented with spondylosicitis and an epidural abscess and required a second biopsy procedure to confirm the diagnosis. He improved with irrigation and drainage of the abscess and continues to do well on 3-drug therapy with azithromycin, rifabutin, and ethambutol.\n\nFigure 1.

Co-administrating allopurinol has been shown to improve tolerability. However, data on this co-therapy as first-line treatment are scarce.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nRetrospective comparison of long-term effectiveness and safety of first-line low-dose azathioprine-allopurinol co-therapy (LDAA) with first-line azathioprine monotherapy (AZAm) in patients with IBD without metabolite monitoring.\n\n\nMETHODS\nClinical benefit was defined as ongoing therapy without initiation of steroids, biologics or surgery. Secondary outcomes included CRP, HBI/SCCAI, steroid withdrawal and adverse events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 166 LDAA and 118 AZAm patients (median follow-up 25 and 27\u00a0months) were evaluated. Clinical benefit was more frequently observed in LDAA patients at 6\u00a0months (74% vs. 53%, p\u2009=\u20090.0003), 12\u00a0months (54% vs. 37%, p\u2009=\u20090.01) and in the long-term (median 36\u00a0months; 37% vs. 24%, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Throughout follow-up, AZAm patients were 60% more likely to fail therapy, due to a higher intolerance rate (45% vs. 26%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Only 73% of the effective AZA dose was tolerated in AZAm patients, while LDAA could be initiated and maintained at its target dose. Incidence of myelotoxicity and elevated liver enzymes was similar in both cohorts, and both conditions led to LDAA withdrawal in only 2%. Increasing allopurinol from 100 to 200-300\u00a0mg/day significantly lowered liver enzymes in 5/6 LDAA patients with hepatotoxicity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur poor AZAm outcomes emphasize that optimization of azathioprine is needed. We demonstrated a long-term safe and more effective profile of first-line LDAA. This co-therapy may therefore be considered standard first-line immunosuppressive.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nAzathioprine (AZA) is a cornerstone immunosuppressive therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [1, 2]. It improves important outcomes such as hospitalization, surgery, steroid use and colorectal cancer risk [3\u20137]. Moreover, AZA has been used for over 50\u00a0years in millions of patients worldwide and hence common as well as rare adverse events are well documented. As IBD most commonly affects patients during their reproductive years, the well-established safety of AZA during pregnancy and breastfeeding is an important advantage, as compared to newer biologics and small-molecule drugs [8\u201310].\n\nUnfortunately, AZA is limited by adverse events with the tolerated dose often being well below the effective dose [11, 12], resulting in 55% of patients discontinuing therapy within 5\u00a0years due to intolerance or ineffectiveness [13]. Consequently, a shift towards early therapy with biologics has occurred in those in more affluent countries. Whilst biologics can be transformative, they do have limitations: poor long-term effectiveness (related to antibody formation) [14]; parenteral administration, which affects quality of life [15]; infusion reactions (occasionally life-threatening) [16]; and high costs [17]. To address some of these concerns, new small-molecule drugs are being developed. However, the potential to optimize established small-molecule drugs like the thiopurines, and subsequently reduce the number of patients escalated to treatments like biologics, is often overlooked. Since thiopurines are affordable this strategy also reduces healthcare costs, which is particularly pertinent for developing countries and uninsured patients in higher-income countries [18].\n\nOne such optimization strategy for patients with IBD is to combine low-dose thiopurine with allopurinol, which was first described in 2005 [19]. Despite the fact that switching AZA monotherapy (AZAm) to low-dose AZA with allopurinol co-therapy (LDAA) improves tolerability and efficacy [19\u201326], LDAA remains underreported in current literature [27], not mentioned in most IBD guidelines [1, 2] and hence underutilized. Moreover, most studies restricted LDAA to patients both failing AZA (due to intolerance or inefficacy) and showing aberrant metabolism i.e. hypermethylation (production of toxic 6-MMPs at the expense of therapeutic 6-TGNs). Conversely, several studies have demonstrated a poor predictive value of metabolites with regard to clinical outcomes. For instance, 52% of the patients resistant [28] and up to 50% of the patients intolerant to AZAm [26, 29] were non-hypermethylators. Of those with high 6-MMP levels, nearly 90% did not show hepatotoxicity [29, 30]. Only using LDAA in patients showing hypermethylation thus excludes a large number of patients who could benefit from LDAA. Furthermore, this approach hinders LDAA use in less affluent institutions/countries without access to metabolite measurements.\n\nApart from being a valuable option for all patients with IBD who have failed AZAm, LDAA might be beneficial as first-line immunosuppressive therapy [24]. Using LDAA as first-line therapy in daily practice (rather than AZAm) could reduce delay in reaching an effective treatment, and could eliminate complex drug dosing and extra monitoring typically needed with AZAm (LDAA can be initiated and maintained at the target/effective dose in most patients). This would improve both patient and clinician experience.\n\nHence, we sought to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of first-line LDAA therapy in a large IBD cohort undirected by 6-TGNs/6-MMPs, and to compare outcomes with a similar AZAm cohort.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Design\n\nMedical records of a single centre (East Surrey Hospital, UK) were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were identified by cross-referencing hospital pharmacy dispensing records from 01/2014 to 05/2019 with a prospective patient registry. Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis or IBD-unclassified and treated with either LDAA or AZAm as first thiopurine therapy, were included. Patients below 18\u00a0years, without complete follow-up or with commencement of therapy before 2014 (to avoid overlap with previously published data [24]) were excluded. Patients were followed until thiopurine discontinuation or therapy escalation, or May 2019.\n\nThroughout the study period, patients were allocated to either LDAA or AZAm based on patient\u2019s preference and/or clinician\u2019s experience/preference with regard to these treatments. AZAm patients were initiated on 50\u00a0mg/day, slowly increased to a target dose of 2.5\u00a0mg/kg/day or 1.25\u00a0mg/kg/day in case of wild-type or heterozygous TPMT activity, respectively. LDAA patients received a target dose from the beginning, i.e. 25% of the equivalent AZAm dose. Allopurinol was commenced at 100\u00a0mg/day.\n\nHematological, biochemical and inflammatory parameters were monitored every 2\u00a0weeks for the first 12\u00a0weeks and then every 3\u00a0months. 6-TGNs and 6-MMPs were not routinely measured.\n\nThis study was considered an audit of routine clinical practice, hence was qualified as being exempt from Research Ethical Committee review. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nPrimary outcome was clinical benefit, which was defined as ongoing therapy without initiation of corticosteroids, biologics or bowel resection, and thus incorporated both efficacy and tolerability. Clinical benefit was assessed at 6 and 12\u00a0months. Moreover, sustained clinical benefit was assigned when the criterion was met during at least 12\u00a0months and maintained until final follow-up. Secondary outcomes included IBD activity scores, CRP and withdrawal of concomitant IBD medication.\n\nSafety\n\nAdverse events and reasons for withdrawal were recorded. Liver abnormalities were categorized into hepatotoxicity (ALT\u2009>\u2009twofold the upper limit of normal;\u2009>\u200982 U/L) and elevated liver enzymes without hepatotoxicity (ALT 41-82 U/L). Leukopenia was defined as leukocytes\u2009<\u20093.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L and thrombocytopenia as platelets\u2009<\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L.\n\nStatistics\n\nEffectiveness analyses were performed according to the per-protocol principle. Patients requiring steroids/biologics during the first three months were excluded from the effectiveness analysis, considering that AZA requires three months to become fully effective [31].\n\nChi-square and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. A Kaplan\u2013Meier plot visualized survival characteristics (event: non-clinical benefit); the curves were compared using Mantel-Cox test and a Cox-regression yielded the hazard ratio.\n\nPatient characteristics associated with clinical benefit in the LDAA cohort based on a univariable Cox-regression (p\u2009<\u20090.20) were included in a multivariable model to identify independent associated factors. A univariate logistic regression examined possible correlations between intolerance to LDAA and gender, age, IBD-type, TPMT activity.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nPatient and Therapy Characteristics\n\nIn total, 166 LDAA and 118 AZAm patients were included (Fig.\u00a01), with a median follow-up of 25 and 27\u00a0months, respectively. Collected baseline characteristics were very similar in both cohorts (Table 1). Primary indication for thiopurines was \u2018active disease\u2019 (LDAA n\u2009=\u2009149 [90%]; AZAm n\u2009=\u2009109 [92%]).

In most cases (11/14 LDAA and 2/3 AZAm patients) thiopurine and biologic therapy were commenced simultaneously because of a top-down therapeutic approach. In those with normal TPMT activity (~90%), median AZA dose was 0.54\u00a0mg/kg/day (LDAA) and 1.83\u00a0mg/kg/day (AZAm).\n\nEffectiveness\n\nClinical benefit rates are summarized in Figs.\u00a02 and 3, and Table 2. Clinical benefit was more frequently observed in LDAA than AZAm patients at 6\u00a0months (116/156 [74%] vs. 59/111 [53%], p\u2009=\u20090.0003) and 12\u00a0months (74/138 [54%] vs. 38/103 [37%], p\u2009=\u20090.01). Furthermore, 51/138 (37%) LDAA compared to 25/103 (24%) AZAm subjects demonstrated sustained clinical benefit during a median of 36 (IQR 20\u201344) and 33 (IQR 22\u201344) months, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.04).Fig. 2 Clinical benefit (CB) in patients receiving low-dose azathioprine with allopurinol (LDAA)\n\nFig. 3 Clinical benefit (CB) in patients receiving azathioprine monotherapy (AZAm)\n\nTable 2 Primary outcome: clinical benefit, n (%)\n\n\tLDAA patients\tAZAm patients\tp-value\t\nClinical benefit at 6\u00a0months\t116/156 (74%)\t59/111 (53%)\t0.0003\t\nClinical benefit at 12\u00a0months\t74/138 (54%)\t38/103 (37%)\t0.01\t\nClinical benefit in the long-term (\u2265\u200912\u00a0months)\t51/138 (37%)\t25/103 (24%)\t0.04\t\n\nA Kaplan\u2013Meier curve (Fig.\u00a04) demonstrates that more LDAA than AZAm patients were having clinical benefit during the entire study period (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Throughout follow-up, AZAm individuals were 60% more likely to fail therapy (95%-CI 1.16\u20132.14). Moreover, median duration of beneficial response from commencement of therapy was 17\u00a0months in the LDAA cohort (95%-CI 9\u201325) compared to 6\u00a0months in the AZAm cohort (95%-CI 1\u201311).Fig. 4 Kaplan Meier survival curve of clinical benefit (CB) in patients treated with azathioprine monotherapy (AZAm) and low-dose azathioprine with allopurinol (LDAA). A statistical difference between the curves was found (p\u2009=\u20090.003)\n\nA multivariable analysis on the association between patient characteristics and clinical benefit in LDAA-treated patients (Table S1, Supplementary Material) demonstrated that stricturing Crohn\u2019s disease was inversely correlated with clinical benefit (hazard ratio 2.09, 95%-CI 1.02\u20134.28). No difference in response to LDAA was found between Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis patients, nor between patients with and without concurrent biologic therapy.\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nSecondary outcomes are summarized in Table 3. Steroid withdrawal within 6\u00a0months occurred in approximately 90% of both cohorts. In the LDAA cohort, 65% (69/106) demonstrated clinical remission (SCCAI\u2009\u2264\u20092 or HBI\u2009\u2264\u20094) at last review, compared to 58% (45/78) in the AZAm (p\u2009=\u20090.31). Biochemical remission (CRP\u2009\u2264\u200910\u00a0mg/L) was observed in 93/158 (59%) and 59/94 (63%) of LDAA and AZAm patients, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.54).Table 3 Secondary outcomes, n (%)\n\n\tLDAA patients\tAZAm patients\tp-value\t\nSteroid withdrawal within 6\u00a0months\t44/47 (94%)\t27/31 (87%)\t0.33\t\nCalcineurin inhibitor withdrawal\t4/6 (67%)\t0/2 (0%)\t0.10\t\nAnti-tumour necrosis factor withdrawala\t4/13 (31%)\t0/3 (0%)\t0.27\t\nSCCAI\u2009\u2264\u20092 at last review\t37/53 (70%)\t24/38 (63%)\t0.51\t\nHBI\u2009\u2264\u20094 at last review\t32/53 (60%)\t21/40 (53%)\t0.45\t\nCRP entire treatment duration:\t\n\u00a0\u2264\u200910\u00a0mg/L\t93/158 (59%)\t59/94 (63%)\t0.54\t\n\u00a0\u2264\u20095\u00a0mg/L\t65/158 (41%)\t40/94 (43%)\t0.83\t\nLDAA low-dose azathioprine with allopurinol, AZAm azathioprine monotherapy, SCCAI Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, HBI Harvey-Bradshaw Index, CRP C-reactive protein\n\nDisease activity scores (SCCAI for ulcerative colitis or HBI for Crohn\u2019s disease) were documented in the patients\u2019 medical records during follow-up in 106/166 (64%) LDAA and 78/118 (66%) AZAm patients; CRP values were available in 158 (95%) and 94 (80%) patients, respectively\n\nEight LDAA patients and 13 AZAm patients could not be assessed for rate of steroid, calcineurin inhibitor or anti-tumour necrosis factor withdrawal, due to insufficient documentation or cessation of thiopurine therapy within 6\u00a0months (only applicable for steroid withdrawal)\n\naBiologic therapy could be tapered off in 2/3 LDAA patients (but not in the single AZAm patient) using biologics prior to thiopurine initiation. Of the patients who commenced thiopurine and biologic therapy simultaneously because of a top-down therapeutic approach, 2/10 LDAA and 0/2 AZAm patients could discontinue biologic during follow-up\n\nAdverse Events\n\nSixty-eight of the 116 AZAm (58%) and 80/166 (48%) LDAA patients experienced adverse events during a median follow-up of 27 and 25\u00a0months, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.12, Table 4). Adverse events were the main reason for discontinuing either LDAA or AZAm. However, a greater proportion of AZAm patients discontinued due to adverse events (AZAm: 53/118 [45%]; LDAA: 43/166 [26%]; p\u2009=\u20090.001). LDAA withdrawal due to intolerance did not depend on gender, age, IBD-type or TPMT level.Table 4 Adverse events, n (% of entire cohort)\n\n\tLDAA patients (n\u2009=\u2009166)\tAZAm patients (n\u2009=\u2009118)\tp-value\t\nPatients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events\t43 (26%)\t53 (45%)\t0.001\t\nHepatotoxicity\t2 (1%)\t3 (3%)\t0.40\t\nElevated LFTs without hepatotoxicity\t1 (0.6%)\t2 (2%)\t0.37\t\nMyelotoxicity\t3 (2%)\t5 (4%)\t0.22\t\n\u00a0Leukopenia\t2 (1%)\t3 (3%)\t\u2013\t\n\u00a0Thrombocytopenia\t1 (0.6%)\t1 (0.8%)\t\u2013\t\n\u00a0Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia\t0\t1 (0.8%)\t\u2013\t\nGastro-intestinal complaints\t22 (13%)\t22 (19%)\t0.22\t\nFatigue\t8 (5%)\t6 (5%)\t0.92\t\nDizziness\t6 (4%)\t5 (4%)\t0.79\t\nArthralgia\t5 (3%)\t3 (3%)\t0.81\t\nAlopecia\t3 (2%)\t0\t0.14\t\nPancreatitis\t3 (2%)\t4 (3%)\t0.40\t\nMalaise\t2 (1%)\t4 (3%)\t0.21\t\nHeadache\t2 (1%)\t6 (5%)\t0.05\t\nRash\t0\t4 (3%)\t0.02\t\nSerious infection\t1 (0.6%)\t1 (0.8%)\t0.81\t\nMalignancy\t0\t0\t\u2013\t\nUnknown\t2 (1%)\t2 (2%)\t\u2013\t\nOther\t5 (3%)\t11 (9%)\t\u2013\t\nPatients experiencing adverse events\t80 (48%)\t68 (58%)\t0.12\t\nHepatotoxicity\t11 (7%)\t8 (7%)\t0.96\t\nElevated LFTs without hepatotoxicity\t13 (8%)\t10 (8%)\t0.84\t\nMyelotoxicity\t18 (11%)\t11 (9%)\t0.17\t\n\u00a0Leukopenia\t9 (5%)\t7 (6%)\t\u2013\t\n\u00a0Thrombocytopenia\t6 (4%)\t1 (0.9%)\t\u2013\t\n\u00a0Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia\t3 (2%)\t3 (3%)\t\u2013\t\nGastro-intestinal complaints\t24 (15%)\t24 (20%)\t0.19\t\nFatigue\t12 (7%)\t7 (6%)\t0.67\t\nDizziness\t6 (4%)\t6 (5%)\t0.54\t\nArthralgia\t5 (3%)\t4 (3%)\t0.86\t\nAlopecia\t3 (2%)\t0\t0.14\t\nPancreatitis\t3 (2%)\t4 (3%)\t0.40\t\nMalaise\t3 (2%)\t5 (4%)\t0.22\t\nHeadache\t5 (3%)\t6 (5%)\t0.37\t\nRash\t0\t4 (3%)\t0.02\t\nSerious infection\t1 (0.6%)a\t1 (0.9%)b\t0.81\t\nMalignancy\t0\t0\t\u2013\t\nUnknown\t3 (2%)\t2 (2%)\t\u2013\t\nOther\t7 (4%)\t12 (10%)\t\u2013\t\nLDAA low-dose azathioprine with allopurinol, AZAm azathioprine monotherapy, LFTs liver function tests\n\naRespiratory tract infection\n\nbCMV reactivation\n\nNo malignancies were reported in either cohort and the incidence of pancreatitis was low.\n\nLiver Enzyme Abnormalities\n\nLiver enzyme abnormalities occurred equally in both cohorts: 11 (7%) patients reported hepatotoxicity and 13 (8%) elevated liver function tests (LFTs) without hepatotoxicity in the LDAA cohort, compared to 8 (7%) and 10 (8%) AZAm patients, respectively. Upon more detailed review of LDAA patients, 4/11 reporting hepatotoxicity and 5/13 reporting elevated LFTs without hepatotoxicity had liver disease prior to LDAA initiation (fatty liver n\u2009=\u20097; focal nodular hyperplasia n\u2009=\u20091; primary sclerosing cholangitis n\u2009=\u20091). In contrast, 1/18 AZAm patients with liver enzyme abnormalities had prior liver disease (fatty liver).\n\nHepatotoxicity led to LDAA discontinuation in two (1%) patients as did elevated LFTs without hepatotoxicity in one patient (0.6%). In six other patients with hepatotoxicity, allopurinol dose was increased to 200\u2013300\u00a0mg/day. Consequently, the abnormal LFTs resolved in 4/6, improved in 1/6 and persisted in the remaining patient (who had primary sclerosing cholangitis). All six patients continued LDAA until final follow-up and did not experience further side effects on the escalated allopurinol dose.\n\nAZAm was discontinued due to hepatotoxicity and elevated LFTs without hepatotoxicity in three (3%) and two (2%) patients, respectively.\n\nMyelotoxicity\n\nIncidence of myelotoxicity was similar in both cohorts (LDAA: 18/166 [11%]; AZAm: 11/118 [9%], p\u2009=\u20090.17). One patient in each cohort required hospital admission related to myelotoxicity (LDAA: respiratory tract infection, AZAm: CMV reactivation).\n\nRegarding the LDAA cohort, 2/21 (10%) with heterozygous TPMT activity developed myelotoxicity, whereas 16/137 (12%) patients with wild-type TPMT (p\u2009=\u20090.77). Additionally, myelotoxicity was not related to gender, age or IBD-type.\n\nUpon minor AZA dose reduction in 5/12 LDAA patients with leukopenia, leukocyte count normalized in three patients. All three were able to continue therapy until final follow-up, without loss of response. Myelotoxicity resulted in permanent LDAA withdrawal in 3/166 (2%) patients.\n\nNone of the AZAm patients had a dose reduction after myelotoxicity was detected and 5/118 (4%) permanently discontinued AZAm due to myelotoxicity.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis is the largest study with the longest follow-up evaluating first-line LDAA for IBD to date, and the first study comparing safety and effectiveness of LDAA (n\u2009=\u2009166) with AZAm (n\u2009=\u2009118) in two very similar cohorts. Ongoing therapy without need for steroids, biologics or surgery was more frequently observed in LDAA compared to AZAm patients at 6\u00a0months (74% vs. 53%), 12\u00a0months (54% vs. 37%) and in the long-term (median 36\u00a0months, 37% vs. 24%). Throughout follow-up, AZAm patients were 60% more likely to fail therapy, due to a higher intolerance rate (45% vs. 26%).\n\nDirect comparison of our results with others is challenging since most studies have evaluated either effectiveness or tolerability of thiopurines, whereas our primary outcome assessed both elements. Nevertheless, high success rates have been reported for low-dose thiopurine with allopurinol therapy, but not for AZAm (see next paragraphs).\n\nTwo well-known randomized, double-blind trials evaluated the efficacy of 2.5\u00a0mg/kg/day AZAm: steroid-free remission was seen in 30% (51/170) of Crohn\u2019s patients at 6\u00a0months [32] and 24% (18/76) of ulcerative colitis patients at 4\u00a0months [33]. The lower response rates compared to our study are likely due to the fact that endpoints of a randomized trial are more difficult to achieve, and that intention-to-treat analysis was used (while we used per-protocol analysis). Recently, long-term effective thiopurine monotherapy was observed in 4995/11928 (42%) subjects, but analysis did not include initiation of steroids [6].\n\nThe high incidence of intolerance to AZAm in our study is in keeping with other studies, in which 30\u201340% of patients withdrew AZAm due to adverse events [11, 12, 34, 35]. Additionally, it is worth noting in these studies that tolerability came at the expense of a sub-therapeutic AZA dose. In our study inability to tolerate an effective AZAm dose (i.e. 2.5\u00a0mg/kg/day for patients with normal TPMT activity [36]) was also observed: only a median dose of 1.83\u00a0mg/kg/day was achieved, which is 73% of the effective dose. Conversely, LDAA could be initiated and maintained at the target dose in most patients, with a better response rate. Hence, using LDAA as first-line therapy in clinical practice (instead of AZAm) would likely reduce periods of active disease, improve patient experience and eliminate the time and costs associated with managing poor treatment effectiveness and intolerance.\n\nIn a previous study, positive response to low-dose thiopurine with allopurinol (AZA in\u2009>\u200950% of patients, mercaptopurine in the rest) at 12\u00a0months was seen in 62% of patients failing thiopurine monotherapy and/or showing hypermethylation [25]. Another study showed thiopurine-allopurinol continuation in 78% (n\u2009=\u2009145) and 66% (n\u2009=\u200983) of patients at 12\u00a0months and 2\u00a0years, respectively [37]. The possible explanation for the greater effectiveness in their study might be a twofold lower incidence of patients with active disease at initiation, and that initiation of steroids, biologics or surgery was not considered treatment failure. In a recent randomized trial, 73% of patients on thiopurine and allopurinol (AZA in 50%) were in steroid-free remission at 6\u00a0months according to per-protocol analysis [20]. Lastly, another study showed clinical benefit during at least 12\u00a0months in 38% of the optimized thiopurine cohort (co-administration of allopurinol in 40%) [23]. The results of these studies are in line with our outcomes.\n\nTo date, effectiveness of thiopurine-allopurinol co-therapy in thiopurine-naive patients has only been assessed by our study group [24]. An improvement in IBD activity scores in the absence of steroid use was observed in 79/110 (72%) patients after a median treatment duration of 12\u00a0months [24].\n\nOur study has limitations which need to be acknowledged. First, allocation to LDAA or AZAm was not randomized. However, collected baseline characteristics in both cohorts were very similar. Another limitation is the retrospective design, which could have led to information bias. The influence of this was minimized by comparing two treatment groups, with a single researcher collecting all of the data. A further limitation concerns sampling bias, as the cohorts were restricted to patients in a single centre. Finally, we were not able to comment on mucosal response or draw firm conclusions regarding CRP level and IBD activity scores due to incomplete data.\n\nAlthough myelotoxicity is a common concern during LDAA therapy, only 12 (7%) LDAA patients developed leukopenia during a median follow-up of 25\u00a0months. This incidence is comparable to our AZAm cohort, to other thiopurine monotherapy studies [12, 38], and also to two large studies using low doses of AZA during co-therapy [26, 37]. The lack of correlation between myelotoxicity and heterozygous TPMT activity in our study can be explained by dose adjustment for weight and TPMT activity.\n\nElevated LFTs occurred in 14% (24/166) of LDAA and 15% (18/118) of AZAm patients during our study, of which 7% of both cohorts had hepatotoxicity. Nine of twenty-four patients with elevated LFTs in the LDAA cohort had a pre-existing liver disorder, which is the likely explanation in these patients. In contrast, the liver injury in the AZAm patients was more likely to be drug-induced as only one patient had a pre-existing liver condition. Previous studies described hepatotoxicity in 5% of LDAA patients [24] and de-novo elevated LFTs in 14% [37], which is in line with our results. Interestingly, we showed that increasing the allopurinol dose can be a beneficial strategy to treat hepatotoxicity. On increasing allopurinol to 200\u2013300\u00a0mg/day, LFTs fell significantly in 5/6 patients and stabilized in a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis. These findings are in concordance with our previous study, in which an escalated allopurinol dose of 300\u00a0mg/day led to normalization of LFTs in 8/11 patients, with the remaining three patients having primary sclerosing cholangitis [24]. The biochemical mechanism for this phenomenon may be that allopurinol reduces methylated metabolites and reactive oxidative free radicals, both of which are thought to be hepatotoxic [19, 29, 39].\n\nAlthough myelotoxicity and elevated LFTs were relatively common in our study, they only resulted in LDAA withdrawal in 2% for either abnormality. Recently, Kreijne et al. reported the same phenomenon in a cohort of 221 patients: myelotoxicity and elevated LFTs led to LDAA cessation in only 4% and 1%, respectively [37].\n\nIn conclusion, this large study demonstrates that optimization of AZA is needed, as poor outcomes were observed in our AZAm cohort. We have shown that first-line co-administration of allopurinol is a long-term effective and safe optimization strategy, even without metabolite monitoring. Although patients may still experience mild laboratory abnormality, we confirmed that myelotoxicity and elevated liver enzymes rarely necessitate LDAA withdrawal if closely monitored and adequately treated. Using LDAA as first-line therapy for IBD (rather than AZAm) would likely reduce periods of active disease, improve patient experience and reduce the number of patients escalated to more expensive treatments like biologics. Hence, LDAA may be considered as standard first-line immunosuppressive.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.Supplementary file1 (DOCX 19 KB)\n\nFunding\n\nThis study was not funded.\n\nDeclarations\n\nConflict of interest\n\nELSA van Liere and AB Bayoumy received unrestricted travel grants from Thimotheus Consult.

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNF-I) are effective for the treatment. Recently, biosimilars of TNF-I, such as CT-P13, have been developed and are thought to possess equal efficacy and safety to the original TNF-I. Sarcoidosis is also a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. In steroid-resistant cases of sarcoidosis, TNF-I have been reported effective for achieving resolution. However, the progression of sarcoidosis due to the TNF-I also has been reported. We herein report a case of pulmonary sarcoidosis with a Crohn's disease (CD) patient developed after a long period administration (15 years) of TNF-I.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 37-year-old woman with CD who had been diagnosed at 22\u00a0years old had been treated with the TNF-I (original infliximab; O-IFX and infliximab biosimilar; IFX-BS). Fifteen years after starting the TNF-I, she developed a fever and right chest pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed clustered small nodules in both lungs and multiple enlarged hilar lymph nodes. Infectious diseases including tuberculosis were negative. Bronchoscopic examination was performed and the biopsy specimens were obtained. A pathological examination demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous lesions and no malignant findings. TNF-I were discontinued because of the possibility of TNF-I-related sarcoidosis. After having discontinued for four months, her symptoms and the lesions had disappeared completely. Fortunately, despite the discontinuation of TNF-I, she has maintained remission.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo our knowledge, this is the first case in which sarcoidosis developed after switching from O-IFX to IFX-BS. To clarify the characteristics of the cases with development of sarcoidosis during administration of TNF-I, we searched PubMed and identified 106 cases. When developing an unexplained fever, asthenia, uveitis and skin lesions in patients with TNF-I treatment, sarcoidosis should be suspected. Once the diagnosis of sarcoidosis due to TNF-I was made, the discontinuation of TNF-I and administration of steroid therapy should be executed promptly. When re-starting TNF-I, another TNF-I should be used for disease control. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of sarcoidosis in patients under anti-TNF therapy.\n\nTEXT:\npmcBackground\n\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is chronic inflammation of the entire gastrointestinal tract, although its etiology has largely been unclear. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are known to be effective treatment for treating IBD patients with moderate to severe activity. The cost-effectiveness and efficacy of TNF inhibitors (TNF-I) has been demonstrated through their reduction in the rates of hospitalization and surgery [1]. Recently, biosimilars of TNF-I, such as CT-P13, have been developed and are thought to possess equal efficacy and safety to the original with dramatic cost benefits. Switching from the original to a biosimilar is thus considered an acceptable treatment [2, 3].\n\nSimilar to IBD, sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, affecting various organs, including the lung, heart, lymphatic system and skin. In many cases of sarcoidosis, steroids are effective for treatment, and in case of steroid resistance, TNF-I are reported to be effective. While some studies have reported that the administration of TNF-I caused the progression of sarcoidosis, no reports regarding the relationship between sarcoidosis and infliximab biosimilar (IFX-BS) have been published.\n\nWe herein report a case of pulmonary sarcoidosis in a Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) patient during fifteen years administration of IFX-BS after switching from original infliximab (O-IFX). To our knowledge, this is the first case of sarcoidosis developing after switching from O-IFX to IFX-BS in a CD patient.\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 37-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with CD at 22\u00a0years of age. She had no relevant family history. At the onset of CD, she had symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and frequent diarrhea. On total colonoscopy, she was found to have multiple longitudinal ulcers in the terminal ileum with stricture. Her symptoms were severe; thus, we administered O-IFX first, without steroid therapy. Clinical remission was obtained after 3\u00a0months of O-IFX treatment. She had maintained clinical remission without any adverse events for twelve years after the administration of O-IFX, and then O-IFX was switched to IFX-BS (CT-P13) after obtaining informed consent, because IFX-BS demonstrated equivalent efficacy and safety in the treatment of CD and the drug price was approximately half that of O-IFX in Japan. After switching to IFX-BS, clinical remission was still maintained for three years.\n\nFifteen years after starting the TNF-I (O-IFX and CT-P13), she developed a fever and right chest pain but had no respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sputum. Laboratory findings showed total bilirubin, 1.5\u00a0mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase, 248 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 105 U/L; gamma glutamyl aminotransferase, 192 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 489 U/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 0.44\u00a0mg/dL; anti-nuclear antibody, 1:160. Hepatitis B and C were negative. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) revealed clustered small nodules in both lungs and multiple enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig.\u00a01). The interferon gamma release assay and an acid-fast bacilli antibody were negative. A tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and bacterium culture of her sputum were both negative. Subsequently, a bronchoscopic examination was performed, and biopsy specimens were obtained from the middle and lower lobes of the right lung. A pathological examination demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous lesions and no malignant findings (Fig.\u00a02). The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and lysozyme levels were within normal limits, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was increased to 627 U/mL (reference range 122\u2013496 U/mL). Thus, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. Her symptoms (low-grade fever and slight chest pain) could be sufficiently managed by the administration of an analgesic antipyretic. Therefore, we did not use steroids and, considering the possibility of TNF-I related sarcoidosis, TNF-I was discontinued. Subsequently, her symptoms improved gradually. In addition, the abnormal laboratory findings, including hepatobiliary enzymes, improved naturally without any treatment after one month. After having discontinued TNF-I for four months, her symptoms of sarcoidosis and the lesions detected by chest CT had disappeared completely (Fig.\u00a03). Fortunately, despite the discontinuation of TNF-I, she has maintained clinical and endoscopic remission for 18\u00a0months after the discontinuation of TNF-I.Fig. 1 CT scan showing multiple nodular lung lesions and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathies\n\nFig. 2 Histological findings of the lung. Histology demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous lesions and no malignant findings (X100)\n\nFig. 3 The nodular lung lesions disappeared after discontinuation of IFX-BS in CT scan\n\nDiscussions and conclusions\n\nWe herein report the pulmonary sarcoidosis after the long-term use of TNF-inhibitors in a CD patient.\n\nTwo possible causes were considered responsible for the development of sarcoidosis in our case: the long-term IFX administration and the switching from the original agent to its biosimilar. To confirm the involvement of these causes and clarify the characteristics of patients likely to develop sarcoidosis under TNF-I therapy, we searched for case reports in PubMed concerning sarcoidosis due to TNF-I using the combination of the heading terms \u2018infliximab\u2019, \u2018adalimumab\u2019, \u2018etanercept\u2019, \u2018certolizumab\u2019, \u2018golimumab\u2019, \u2018infliximab biosimilar\u2019, with or without \u2018Crohn\u2019s disease\u2019, combined with \u2018sarcoidosis\u2019. We identified 6 articles concerning 7 cases using the word combination with CD [4\u20139] and 65 articles concerning 99 cases using the word combination without CD (details in Additional file 1: Table 1) [10\u201374]. Regarding the impact of long-term TNF-I administration, in 103 cases, the median duration of developing sarcoidosis was 21 (range 1\u201390) months, and the maximum period was 90\u00a0months, according to previous reports. However, since those reports contained various diseases, we reviewed the seven cases with CD (excluding our own case). The median duration to the development of sarcoidosis was 24 (range 7\u201390) months, and the maximum period was 90\u00a0months. Our case was administered O-IFX for 144\u00a0months and then IFX-BS for 36\u00a0months. Based on the previous reports, the duration of 180\u00a0months until the development of sarcoidosis in our case was the longest, exceeding the longest period in previous reports by more than 7\u00a0years. Long-term IFX administration may affect the development of sarcoidosis, as the administration of TNF-I presumably induces cytokine imbalance (TNF-\u03b1 suppression and excessive Interferon-\u03b1 production) [75]. It took a very long time to for the patient to develop sarcoidosis; however, it may have been a possible complication as the time to the induction of cytokine imbalance seems to show individual differences. In addition, infection is suggested to be a cause of sarcoidosis, and the treatment with TNF-I increases the risk of various infections [10\u201312], which can lead to the onset of sarcoidosis. Prudent follow-up should thus be performed, including observation of CD patients under long-term IFX administration. Regarding the impact of switching from O-IFX to IFX-BS, we thought that the possibility of sarcoidosis caused by changing O-IFX to IFX-BS would be quite low because of the very slight differences in the sugar chain sequences of O-IFX and IFX-BS and their almost equivalent immunogenicity [76].\n\nRegarding other characteristics of CD patients, the median age was 30 (range 21\u201344) years, and the male:female ratio was 5:3 when including our case. The causative TNF inhibitors were adalimumab (ADA) (n\u2009=\u20094, 50.0%, including a case switching from IFX to ADA) and IFX (n\u2009=\u20094, 50%, including our case). The symptoms depended on the organs involved. Our case showed an unexplained fever and chest pain because of pleuritis. Asthenia, uveitis, and skin lesions were also reported. There were no specific symptoms.\n\nIn this case, the serum ACE level was normal. It was reported that serum ACE shows low sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis [77]. In addition, it is known that the serum ACE level is affected by genetic polymorphism [78, 79]. Clinicians should recognize that the serum ACE levels alone are not enough to diagnose sarcoidosis.\n\nWe also investigated the difference in the duration until the development of sarcoidosis under IFX and ADA therapy in the six CD cases without switching cases. The median duration to the development of sarcoidosis in CD patients under IFX (n\u2009=\u20093) and ADA (n\u2009=\u20093) therapy was 12 and 24\u00a0months, respectively. Patients receiving ADA therapy showed a longer duration until development than those receiving IFX, which might have influenced the difference in antibody type, such as chimeric human-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody and fully human monoclonal antibody. However, the number of such cases has been limited so far, so the accumulation of more cases will be required to verify whether or not differences in antibodies affects the development of sarcoidosis.\n\nRegarding the therapy delivered after the development of sarcoidosis, six of eight cases discontinued TNF-I, two without steroid and four with additional steroid, and two cases continued TNF-I therapy while adding steroid therapy or topical therapy. All six cases who discontinued TNF-I with/without steroids showed the resolution of sarcoidosis. In one case, in which the patient continued TNF-I with steroid treatment, improvement of the lung lesion was observed. In one case in which the patient continued TNF-I with topical steroid treatment, improvement of the lung lesion, but not the skin lesion, was observed. In CD patients who develop sarcoidosis, discontinuation of TNF-I seems to be a feasible treatment. Among 107 cases with various diseases, 47 discontinued TNF-I without the addition of steroid therapy, and sarcoidosis was improved or resolved in 43 (91.5%), while 49 cases discontinued TNF-I with the addition of steroid therapy, and 46 (93.9%) showed improvement or resolution of sarcoidosis. These data support the notion that discontinuing TNF-I is effective for treating patients with chronic inflammatory disease, but the efficacy of additional steroid therapy is unclear.\n\nOur case has maintained remission despite having discontinued TNF-I; however, TNF-I may be key drugs for CD patients. Thus, whether or not TNF-I can be re-initiated for these patients is important to clarify. Only one CD patient re-initiated the same TNF inhibitor (O-IFX) with no recurrence of sarcoidosis observed [8]. When expanding target diseases to include rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, psoriasis, CD, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, SAPHO (synovitis, pustulosis, acne, hyperostosis, osteitis), ulcerative colitis, 25 patients re-initiated TNF-I. Of 25 patients, 7 were administered the same TNF-I, and sarcoidosis consequently recurred in 4 cases (57.1%) [8, 11, 23, 27, 39, 63]. Eighteen cases started another TNF-I, and sarcoidosis recurred in 3 cases (16.7%) [13, 27, 64\u201374]. These data suggested that another TNF-I should be administered when re-initiating TNF-I in such patients.\n\nIn conclusion, should be aware that TNF-I can cause several drug related complications, including sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis due to TNF-I can be caused by IFX-BS and develop even after long-term administration. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of sarcoidosis in patients under anti-TNF therapy. The efficacy of additional steroid therapy remains unclear; however, TNF-I should be discontinued as soon as possible, even in CD patients who maintain long-term remission with TNF-I. When re-starting TNF-I, another TNF-I should be used for disease control, as relapse of sarcoidosis is frequent when patients are treated with the same TNF-I (Table 1).Table 1 The characteristics of sarcoidosis in CD patients receiving TNF inhibitor therapy\n\nReferences\tSex\tTNF inhibitor/delay until onset of causative TNF inhibitor (months)\tOrgans involved\tTreatment/outcome\tRe-initiation TNF inhibitor\tRelapse after re-initiation\t\n[4]\tF\tIFX/60\tSpinal cord\tIFX discontinuation and PSL/resolution\t\u2013\t\t\n[5]\tM\tADA/24\tHilar and mediastinal nodes, erythema nodosum\tADA discontinuation and PSL/resolution\t\u2013\t\t\n[6]\tF\tADA/18\tMediastinal nodes, nodules on the spleen\tADA continue and PSL/resolution\t\u2013\t\t\n[7]\tM\tIFX/7\tErythematous skin plaques, bilateral nodular pulmonary infiltrates\tIFX continue and topical therapy /resolution of lung, but skin not resolved\t\u2013\t\t\n[8]\tM\tIFX/12\thilar adenopathies, pulmonary infiltrate\tIFX discontinuation/resolution\tIFX re-start\t\t\n[9]\tM\tADA/60\tUveitis, mediastinal nodes, mesenterial nodes\tADA discontinuation and PSL/resolution\t\u2013\t\t\n\tM\tIFX/72, ADA/18\tErythema nodosum, mediastinal nodes\tADA discontinuation and PSL/resolution\t\u2013\t\t\nPresent case\tF\tO-IFX 144, IFX-BS 36\tBilateral pulmonary infiltrates, hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy\tIFX-BS discontinuation/resolution\t\u2013\t\t\nM, male; F, female; ETN, etanercept; ADA, adalimumab; IFN, infliximab; IFX-BS, infliximab biosimilar\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nAdditional file 1.

Another feature of this disease is the presence of a necrotizing vasculitis that mainly affects small and medium vessels and is associated with asthma and eosinophilia. In 2012, after the Chapel Hill international consensus conference [1], the name \u201cChurg-Strauss syndrome\u201d was replaced by EGPA [2]. The evolution of EGPA commonly follows three phases [3,4]: i) onset of asthma associated with rhinitis; ii) tissue eosinophilia; and iii) extrapulmonary eosinophil involvement with vasculitis. Asthma in EGPA is systematically severe and often refractory to common treatment [5], it is corticosteroid resistant and can often anticipate the onset of systemic vasculitis by many years [6,7]. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are present in approximately 40% of EGPA patients [8,9]. ANCA play an important role in the diagnosis and in the pathogenesis of EGPA. These autoantibodies cause endothelial damage, as well as the infiltration of eosinophils, which are mechanisms underlying the typical histological damage. The pathogenetic effects of ANCA are due to their ability to activate neutrophils with consequent tissue and vascular damage [10,11]. A release of cytokines necessary for the activation, maturation and survival of eosinophils, such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 occurs in the activated Th-2 phenotype [12,13]. In particular, IL-5 level is high in active EGPA and its inhibition has become a key therapeutic target as in severe eosinophilic asthma [14-16]. The increase in eosinophils has a cytotoxic and pro-coagulant effect that often determines not only pulmonary, but also cardiovascular and cerebrovascular organ damage [17,18]. The existence of a cross-talk between T lymphocytes and eosinophils has also been demonstrated. It is driven by a high concentration of IL-25, which induces T cells to produce cytokines stimulating the Th-2 and eosinophilic response, due to a positive feedback effect. The pathogenesis of EGPA is not due only to an increased Th-2 response [19]. The immune response is also amplified by endothelial and epithelial cells that produce chemokines, mainly eotaxin-3 (CCL-26) and chemokine-17 (CCL-17), which have a chemotaxis effect on eosinophils [20]. Eotaxin-3 is particularly elevated in patients with active EGPA and it significantly correlates with the level of eosinophils, total IgE and inflammation related parameters [21].\n\nOral glucocorticoids (OCS) reduce blood and tissue eosinophils by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting survival signaling pathways; they have long been regarded as the first-line treatment for EGPA [22]. Unfortunately, frequent relapses occur in many patients after dose tapering or despite high maintenance doses [23,24]. Prolonged therapies with OCS (or sometimes high doses for short periods) lead to severe and sometimes irreversible adverse effects, such as infections, osteoporosis, diabetes and secondary adrenal insufficiency [25,26]. Immunosuppressive agents are indicated as maintenance therapy and in the treatment of EGPA exacerbations [27]. Despite this use, some evidence indicates that immunosuppressive drugs do not lead to significant reductions in relapse rates [28]. As a result, there is a great need for truly effective treatment options which are burdened with fewer side effects. Mepolizumab, a fully humanized anti-IL-5 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), was evaluated in the MIRRA trial [29], at a dose of 300 mg / 4 weeks in patients with EGPA, demonstrating its superiority over standard treatment in terms of remission rate, time required for first relapse, reduction in OCS dose. However, a significant proportion of the patients in this study (approximately half) did not even achieve remission with mepolizumab co-administered with OCS. Anyway, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mepolizumab 300 mg / 4 weeks for EGPA [30]. In addition to this, there are retrospective real-life studies confirming the efficacy of mepolizumab even at the dose of 100 mg (approved for asthma) in EGPA during a remission phase [31,32]. Benralizumab, a humanized IgG1k afucosylated monoclonal antibody anti IL-5 receptor \u03b1 chain, demonstrated efficacy in numerous studies, especially in real contexts, in terms of reduction of the average dose of OCS, a rapid depletion of blood eosinophils, a consistent improvement of respiratory symptoms and lung function in patients with EGPA [33-37]. In this article, we describe the case of a man with EGPA, severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), with poor asthma control despite OCS and mepolizumab treatment. Respiratory symptoms improved markedly after therapeutic switch to benralizumab.\n\nCase presentation\n\nA 57-year-old man, non-smoker, came to our observation. He worked as an industrial machinery mechanic. The patient was not exposed to inhalation of chemicals and there were no changes in respiratory symptoms away from the workplace. In May 2018, due to persistent dry cough, dyspnea and wheezing he was sent by his general practioner for a respiratory clinical assessment. On the physical examination of the chest, rhonchi and wheezing were detected. Respiratory function tests showed moderate bronchial obstruction (Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 62% of predicted) with a significant response to the bronchodilation test (+ 18%; + 480 ml). Skin prick tests were negative for inhalant allergens while blood tests showed eosinophilia (790 cells/ul, 8%). Body mass index (BMI) was 24. Therefore, bronchial asthma was diagnosed and therapy was started with high dose salmeterol / fluticasone, salbutamol spray as needed and prednisone 25 mg 2 tablets a day for 5 days, with gradual reduction. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses showed mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus with osteomeatal engagement and initial mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and both frontal sinuses. Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22) score was 51.5. For persistence of cough and bronchospasm, the patient referred to an otolaryngologist, who evidenced mucosal secretion with post-nasal drip, edema of the right meatus and bilateral polyposis. He also hypothesized gastroesophageal reflux due to typical physical examination findings, including arytenoid erythema and edema. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was then performed, revealing grade A reflux esophagitis. A therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was then set up, with esomeprazole 40 mg per day. Then, the patient repeated a pulmonology examination in July 2018 due to poor improvement in respiratory symptoms. An assessment of medication adherence had been made, and was appropriate. Consequently, the therapy was modified by stopping salmeterol/fluticasone and starting high dose of beclometasone/formoterol spray and adding tiotropium bromide. Prednisone 25 mg per day was also included due to recurrence of asthma symptoms after an attempted withdrawal of OCS. Blood tests performed in September 2018 showed eosinophilia (4790 cells/ul, 27%), Antineutrophil myeloperoxidase cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA) level was 17.9, whilst proteinase 3 (PR3- ANCA), antinuclear Antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) were negative. Total immunoglobulin E (IgE) were 113 IU/mL (v.n. <100) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) value (ppb) 43. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and intestinal parasites infection were ruled out. The patient then underwent a high-resolution chest CT scan, that showed parenchymal centrilobular nodules and the presence of multiple, faded, bilateral ground glass areas. Skin lesions on the back of the hands were detected and they were compatible with vasculitis according to the dermatologist\u2019s diagnosis and a skin biopsy showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis with several eosinophils in the dermal infiltrate. In suspicion of vasculitis, the patient underwent a fibrobronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies; histological findings showed necrotizing small vessel vasculitis associated with eosinophil infiltrates and perivascular and extravascular granulomas. BAL demonstrated macrophages and rare lymphocytes with neutrophilic granulocytes and alveolar eosinophilia (35%). Doppler echocardiography was normal. The patient was seen by a rheumatologist, who confirmed the diagnosis of EGPA but did not indicate add-on immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine/mycophenolate or rituximab/cyclophosphamide, also considering the absence of mononeuritis multiplex in our patient. Mononeuritis multiplex predicts the need for immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs for EGPA, and its absence reduces the need for these add on drugs burdened with important side effects [38]. On January 2019, due to the persistence of poor asthma control with the need for daily therapy with OCS, after a pulmonology evaluation, the patient began therapy with mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously (SC). Four months later, asthma symptoms persisted unchanged and, in an attempt to improve respiratory symptoms, the patient underwent Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) for CRSwNP. The patient had a temporary improvement in nasal and bronchial symptoms, with a SNOT-22 score of 44.3, compared to the baseline of 51.5. Subsequently he returned to previous symptoms. Blood eosinophils were 280 cells/ul (3%) and FeNO was 18 ppb. In August 2019 a new pulmonology examination was carried out, due to suboptimal asthma control without the possibility of reducing OCS dosage. Therefore, it was decided to discontinue mepolizumab after seven administrations due to lack of efficacy. After a 3- month washout period the patient started benralizumab 30 mg sc once every 4 weeks for the first three doses, then once every 8 weeks. We excluded mepolizumab 300 mg once every 4 weeks because it was not approved in Europe for EGPA therapy yet and our local ethics committee hardly grants approval to the higher dose since an alternative therapeutic option such as benralizumab is available. In contrast, the standard dose (30 mg) of benralizumab was very effective and in the literature there are studies that confirm the great efficacy of benralizumab in EGPA thanks to profound antieosinophilic effect in different tissues. These could be potential advantages of this biologic in the treatment of EGPA [39]. Respiratory symptoms progressively improved after just 3 months. The patient was reassessed by a respiratory physician in March 2020, recording excellent asthma control and an improvement in symptoms related to CRSwNP (SNOT-22 score improved to 34.6). The dosage of prednisone was then reduced to 8 mg per day, then subsequently reduced to 4 mg per day and finally withdrawn 6 months after starting benralizumab therapy (Table 1). Regarding blood tests, an important reduction in MPO-ANCA and blood eosinophils was found (0 cells/ul, 0.1%). FeNO value was 13 ppb. Since the start of benralizumab therapy 12 months before, the patient has not presented any asthma exacerbation (Figure 1) and respiratory function tests have improved, returning to normal levels (FEV1 pred., FVC 91%pred., FEV1/FVC 105%) (Table 2 and Figure 2). High-resolution chest CT no longer showed groundglass opacities and centrilobular nodules present at baseline control and also the skin lesions on the back of the hands present before the start of biological therapy had disappeared. Another fundamental aspect was the absence of side effects with the use of benralizumab during the whole observation period.\n\nTable 1.

Patients often suffer from refractory or relapsing conditions despite immunosuppressant and corticosteroid therapies. These drugs are also burdened with important side effects. After the excellent results obtained with mepolizumab in the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA), the anti-IL5 biologic has also been studied in EGPA [40,41]. Mepolizumab was approved by the FDA at a dose of 300 mg SC every 4 weeks after the results of just one randomized clinical trial (RCT) [29]. Nevertheless, in some real-life studies mepolizumab was given at the dose 150 of 100 mg every 4 weeks, the dose approved for the treatment of SEA [31,42]. In the DREAM pivotal study, a comparable clinic efficacy was demonstrated with three intravenous (IV) doses of mepolizumab: 75, and 750 mg, every 4 weeks; in the subsequent MENSA trial, the effective dose was 100 mg SC every 4 weeks [40,41]. The first studies on the use of mepolizumab in EGPA reported clinical efficacy at the 750 mg IV dose [43-46]. Considering these findings, we treated our patient with the lowest dose of mepolizumab, but without obtaining positive clinical results. As the indication of mepolizumab for EGPA at a dose of 300 mg has not been approved in Europe yet, it is usually necessary to obtain approval from ethics committees to treat patients. Therefore, we decided to carry out a therapeutic switch to benralizumab, given its potent effect on reducing eosinophils, which are the key of EGPA pathogenesis. The high affinity of benralizumab to the \u03b1 chain of IL-5R blocks activation and signal transduction. Furthermore, the afucosylation increases the function of cell-mediated cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies (ADCC), making this biological drug able to reduce the number of circulating eosinophils between 90 and 100% in various tissues [47]. This peculiar mechanism of action could represent an advantage in EGPA. As for mepolizumab, various studies in real world settings confirmed efficacy of benralizumab not only in SEA, but also in EGPA [33-36,39]. Data from an ongoing RCT suggesting the efficacy and OCS sparing effect of benralizumab (NCT04157348) are not available yet [48]. Another ongoing RCT (NCT03010436) is recruiting patients with the purpose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of benralizumab 30 mg compared to mepolizumab 300 mg administered by SC injection (SC) in patients with relapsed or refractory EGPA on OCS therapy with or without stable immunosuppressive therapy [49]. A recent prospective open-label pilot study in a small number of EGPA patients treated with benralizumab 30 mg sc showed that the drug was well tolerated and it allowed to reduce OCS and EGPA relapses [34]. In our OCS and mepolizumab refractory EGPA patient, benralizumab confirmed great clinical efficacy while maintaining an excellent safety profile and also allowing complete weaning from OCS. During the course of treatment, in addition to the positive clinical effects, we witnessed a rapid and stable depletion of blood eosinophils and MPO-ANCA, as well as an improvement in both pulmonary function tests and CT scan. Consequently, there was no need for initiating therapy with mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, probably more effective than the lower dose but also burdened with much higher pharmacoeconomic costs, already high at the 100 mg dose [50].\n\nThe present study shows that benralizumab was effective in obtaining a great improvement in our patient outcomes, with positive results just after a few weeks, that were mainteined after a year, thanks to its \u201caggressive\u201d effect of tissue depletion of eosinophils. These excellent effects are even more remarkable as they were obtained in a patient unresponsive to a previous treatment with an anti-IL5 agent, known to be effective in EGPA. It is important to note that our patient had some characteristics that allowed better results with benralizumab, notably high blood eosinophilia, CRSwNP, impaired respiratory function and frequent exacerbations. These aspects could guide the choice of this therapeutic option in EGPA, as it already happens in SEA as well. Nevertheless, clinical studies on larger populations with selected patients and head-to-head comparisons between anti-IL5 biologics are needed.\n\nFigure 1.

In this multicenter retrospective study, the coexistence of both diseases was investigated in children diagnosed from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2019.\n\n\nMETHODS\nClinical characteristics of both IBD and ITP, onset of disorders, and patient's response to treatment were collected through a structured form sent to 55 Italian pediatric referring centers for hematological disorders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCenters responded to the survey and reported the coexistence of IBD and ITP in 14 children. The first diagnosis was ITP in 57.1% and IBD in 35.7% of patients: it was simultaneous in 7.1%. IBD was classified as ulcerative colitis (57.1%), Crohn disease (35.7%), and unclassified (7.1%). No therapy for IBD other than steroids had any effect on ITP course. Colectomy resulted in recovery from ITP in 1 of the 2 patients surgically treated. ITP was always mild but turned to be chronic in half of patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn all patients, ITP was mild without any evident impact on IBD severity, but the incidence of chronic ITP seems to be higher than what is usually observed in the pediatric age group. Colectomy had unpredictable effects on ITP.\n\nTEXT:\n1. Introduction\n\nMany extraintestinal autoimmune manifestations are reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the most common hematological type being autoimmune hemolytic anemia [1,2,3,4]. In rare cases, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a hematological disorder characterized by the production of autoantibodies against platelets, can be associated [5,6,7,8,9,10,11]: only a few patients are of pediatric age [1,12]. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the largest series of children affected by both ITP and IBD.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nThis retrospective study was designed by the Coagulation Defects Study Group of A.I.E.O.P. (Associazione Italiana Emato-Oncologia Pediatrica). Informed consent for inclusion in the study was obtained from the parents or the legal guardians of all patients. A case report form (CRF) was sent to all 55 A.I.E.O.P. centers collecting information about IBD/ITP patients up to 18 years of age diagnosed for ITP or IBD or both from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2019. Children affected by a known immunodeficiency were excluded. ITP clinical phenotype and IBD clinical phenotype + biopsy results were recorded. IBDs were classified as Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU). ITP was defined as newly diagnosed (within 3 months from diagnosis), persistent (between 3 and 12 months from diagnosis), and chronic (cITP, lasting for more than 12 months) [13]. The severity of ITP was defined as [14]: score A, asymptomatic-paucisymptomatic ITP, clinical symptoms ranging from no bleeding to a few petechiae and some bruises without mucosal hemorrhages; score B, intermediate ITP, clinical picture with more petechiae, bruising, and mucosal hemorrhages; score C, severe ITP, clinical picture with severe cutaneous and mucosal bleeding symptoms with at least one of the following\u2014retinal hemorrhages, intracranial hemorrhage, other severe internal hemorrhages, hemorrhagic shock, life-threatening bleeding. At the time of diagnosis, the patients were classified as: (1) IBD first (IBD was diagnosed before ITP); (2) ITP first (ITP was diagnosed before IBD); or (3) Simultaneous diagnosis (the second disease (IBD or ITP) was diagnosed during hospitalization or initial ascertainment for the other disorder). With regard to therapy efficacy, ITP complete response was defined as any platelet count \u2265 100,000/mmc with absence of bleeding; partial response was defined as any platelet count between 30 and 100,000/mmc with at least doubling of the baseline count and absence of bleeding; and no response was defined as any platelet count <30,000/mmc or less than doubling of the baseline count and/or occurrence of bleeding. Statistical analysis was performed using the open-source statistical software R (R Development Core Team 2011) [15].\n\n3. Results\n\nWe collected CRFs regarding 14 IBD/ITP patients from 11 A.I.E.O.P. centers (Table 1): they were all Caucasian (M/F = 1/1). The most relevant clinical features of this cohort are shown in Table 2.\n\nThe median follow up (FUP) from ITP and IBD diagnosis was 6.2 (range: 0.05\u201315.8) and 3.7 years (range: 0.22\u201313.0), respectively. Median age at IBD and ITP diagnosis was 8.4 (range: 2.9\u201328.6) and 7.6 years (range: 2.4\u201315.8), respectively. A family history positive for other autoimmune disease was present in 4 patients (28.6%). Extraintestinal autoimmune disorders other than ITP affected 4 patients (28.6%): 2 out of 4 were psoriasis. The median number of platelets at ITP diagnosis was 31,500/mmc (range: 3000\u201398,000), and the severity score was A in 71.4% and B in 28.6% of patients, respectively. ITP turned to be persistent in 9/14 patients (64.3%) and chronic in 7/14 (50%): the median number of platelets at 3 and 12 months from ITP onset was 74,000 (range: 4000\u2013366,000) and 100,000/mmc (range: 3000\u2013500,000), respectively; 3 patients at 12 months from ITP diagnosis had platelets less than 20,000/mmc. At the last FUP 5/14 patients (35.8%) were presenting cITP, and 3 out of 5, still receiving treatment with eltrombopag, had acceptable platelet counts of 82,000, 91,000, and 93,000/mmc, respectively: these 3 children (Table 1) had been previously treated unsuccessfully with IVIG, steroids, MMF, and sirolimus (the first one), IVIG and steroids (the second one), and IVIG, steroids and MMF (the last one). Helicobacter pylori was tested in 10/14 patients using a stool antigen test and was found negative in all of them. Bone marrow aspiration was performed in 9/14 patients (64.3%) and was always consistent with ITP, showing normal to increased megakaryocyte numbers. The IBD was classified as UC in 57.1%, CD in 35.7%, and IBDU in 7.1%: Three out of fourteen patients had pancolitis. The first diagnosis was ITP in 8 patients (57.1%) and IBD in 5 patients (35.7%): it was simultaneous in 1 patient only. In the ITP first subgroup, the median time from diagnosis of ITP to diagnosis of IBD was 3.6 years (range: 0.8\u201312.8 years). In the IBD first subgroup, the median time from diagnosis of IBD to diagnosis of ITP was 2.1 years (range: 0.6\u20137.6 years). At ITP onset, 4/14 of the patients (28.6%) were not treated (wait-and-see), 8/14 (57.1%) received iv immunoglobulin (IVIG), and 2/14 (14.3%) oral prednisone. Subsequent rescue therapies for ITP were attempted in 7 patients (50.0%): most received IVIG or oral prednisone, 1 rituximab, 2 oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), 1 sirolimus, and 3 eltrombopag. No therapy for ITP, other than steroids, had any effect on IBD. Colectomy was performed in 2 patients: both presented complete remission from IBD and 1 of them also had a complete recovery from ITP.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nITP is caused by antiplatelet autoantibodies that, binding to platelet membrane glycoproteins, mediate the destruction of platelets in the reticuloendothelial system [13,14,16]. The diagnosis of ITP is clinical, based on history, physical examination, and complete blood count with examination of peripheral blood smear and after exclusion of secondary causes, which are very uncommon in childhood. The association of ITP with other autoimmune diseases, above all thyroid autoimmune diseases and systemic lupus erythematosus, is well known [16,17].\n\nIBDs represent a spectrum of enteropathies, including CD, UC, and IBDU, with a variable level of seriousness and a wide range of associated autoimmune disorders whose cumulative prevalence is 8.2% to 10.5% [18]. Autoimmune antibody-related hematologic diseases, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune neutropenia, and ITP [5,6,19,20,21], have been occasionally reported in patients with IBD: up to now, fewer than 80 cases of IBD/ITP association of every age have been published, about two-thirds being UC [1,7,8]. There is a scarcity of literature about the association between IBD and ITP in childhood and, other than the cohort of 8 patients of Higuchi [12], to the best of our knowledge, only 15 other IBD/ITP pediatric patients have been published, mostly in single case reports [9,10,11,18,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. Of these 23 pediatric patients, 12 were UC, 10 CD, and 1 IBDU. The present paper collected 14 patients, 8 of whom were UC; thus, in accordance with what was previously reported [12,23], it seems that UC is the type of IBD more commonly associated with ITP in childhood. Pancolitis was present in 3/8 UCs of our cohort (37.5%), a prevalence in line with what has been reported in childhood [31]. Evaluating the literature on the topic, it seems that, as far as the timing of the first diagnosis is concerned, the occurrence of ITP is much more common in childhood [12] than in adulthood [1,19,32]: our series validates this feature with more than half of the patients having presented ITP before IBD. This is an important point since, based on the much higher prevalence of patients with \u201cIBD first\u201d in adulthood, it has been frequently speculated that ITP in these patients is caused by IBD [6,19], secondary to immunostimulation from lumenal antigens: the pediatric experience, being the majority of the \u201cITP first\u201d patients, seems not to corroborate this hypothesis, even though colectomy in 1 of the 2 surgically treated children resulted in complete recovery from ITP, and so in at least some patients a trigger mechanism from intestinal antigens cannot be excluded. One of the more interesting findings from our analysis is, in our opinion, the high incidence of cITP (50%), which is in accordance with the only one other cohort of pediatric patients [12], where 75% of children developed a chronic form. Therefore, it seems that in cases associated with IBD, the occurrence of cITP is higher than the 20\u201330% usually observed in the pediatric population [33], suggesting that a possible common underlying immune dysregulation can increase the rate of chronic forms, similar to what has been observed in secondary ITP in the course of other autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythematosus or common variable immunodeficiency [34]. ITP features, irrespective of their appearance before or after IBD, are in our cohort very similar to what is typically observed in pediatric ITP, with mild onset and course: no patient suffered from severe hemorrhage and a rectal bleeding at IBD onset was experienced in 8 patients, 4 of whom were \u201cITP first\u201d or \u201csimultaneous\u201d and 4 \u201cIBD first\u201d; so, it seems that a low platelet count does not affect in a definite manner the severity onset of enteropathy. In 2 out of 12 evaluable patients (16.6%), a concomitance between IBD flare and lowering of platelet counts was observed. From what has been previously published, no indication about the possible efficacy of any ITP therapy on IBD and vice versa can be drawn: analyzing our data, no IBD therapy other than steroids, in agreement to other previous reports [19], showed any clear impact on ITP and vice versa. Infliximab, a drug that showed conflicting but frequently good results on platelet count [6,29,35,36,37,38,39], was administered in 4 patients of our cohort but did not have any impact on ITP course. With regard to colectomy, whose efficacy on platelet count is often but not always found [1,12,22,26,27,32,40,41,42], it resulted in complete recovery from ITP in both of the 2 surgically treated patients of our series, but one of them exhibited an early ITP relapse only 4 weeks after colectomy: on this basis, in our opinion, it seems impossible to predict whether colectomy may have a definitive curative role in both ITP and IBD. Finally, we report 3 IBD/ITP children who, to the best of our knowledge, were the first to be treated with eltrombopag, a few of whom grew to adulthood [43]: all of them presented a sustained platelet response.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn summary, we present the largest case series reported to date of children affected by both IBD and ITP. With the inherent limitations of a retrospective design, we think that our results provide informative insights with regard to this rare pediatric population, where UC seems to be the most commonly associated type of IBD, the incidence of the chronic ITP form is higher than what is usually observed, colectomy has an unpredictable effect on ITP course, and steroids can be effective in both diseases. Finally, eltrombopag retains its efficiency in pediatric ITPs associated with IBD.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe Parents\u2019 Association A.S.L.T.I\u2014Liberi di crescere is acknowledged for supporting the activity of the Pediatric Onco-Hematology Unit of A.R.N.A.S.

It is also a significant opportunistic infection in non-immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we present a rare case of membranous nephropathy (MN) with pulmonary cryptococcosis. A 33-year-old man with MN was referred to our hospital because of dyspnea and weakness for 1 week. Before the above symptoms occurred, the dose of Cyclosporin A was increased again for relapse of MN. Multiple massive or patchy high-density shadows were present on computed tomography of the lung. Initially the patient underwent empirical anti-bacterial therapy, which turned out to be ineffective. As the results of serum cryptococcal latex agglutination tests were positive, the administration of anti-fungal drugs was prescribed. The results of fungal culture and pathologic examination of the lung tissue revealed the findings consistent with Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient was successfully treated with voriconazole followed by fluconazole with satisfactory result. Therefore, in patients with chronic kidney disease, lung lesions with poor bactericidal effects of cephalosporins need further examination to make sure whether there is pulmonary cryptococcosis. Early diagnosis and treatment might contribute to good results. It is a problem worthy of consideration that whether immunosuppressive agents need to be discontinued or not during antifungal therapy.\n\nTEXT:\n1 Introduction\nCryptococcosis is a potentially serious fungal disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Clinical presentation of cryptococcosis varies from asymptomatic to life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Previous large-scale retrospective analyses have shown that pulmonary cryptococcosis occurs predominantly in patients with HIV. Additional predisposing factors include underlying solid organ transplantation [2], aggressive cancer treatment, use of immunosuppressants or glucocorticoids, connective tissue diseases, or conditions that may damage immune function [3,4,5]. There are fewer cases that have been reported to present with chronic kidney disease with pulmonary cryptococcal infection. In this study, we report a case of membranous nephropathy (MN) with pulmonary cryptococcosis.\n\n2 Case report\nA 33-year-old man with MN was referred to our hospital in February 2018 because of worsening of dyspnea and weakness for 1 week, not accompanied by cough, sputum, or fever. The patient was given a renal biopsy for nephrotic syndrome and diagnosed with as idiopathic MN (IMN) in May 2008 after excluding tumors, hepatitis, and other factors. Treatment with 60\u2009mg of prednisone daily was started after diagnosis of IMN. Because proteinuria continued, treatment was changed to prednisone 30\u2009mg/day and tripterygium glycosides 60\u2009mg/day in August 2008. Six months after prednisone treatment, the patient developed bilateral femoral head necrosis. Then the treatment regimen was adjusted to Cyclosporin A (CsA) 75\u2009mg/12\u2009h. The patient was treated successfully and then controlled with CsA 75\u2009mg/day till 1 year later. Over the next few years, he experienced recurred albuminuria for several times. Even though he remained stable for about 4 years after his most recent discharge, he still required CsA 25\u2009mg/12\u2009h to control recurrence of his disease. Because proteinuria relapsed, treatment with 75\u2009mg of CsA twice daily was increased again in January 2018 and, 1 month later, dyspnea and shortness of breath occurred. The lung computed tomography (CT) scan in local hospital showed nodules involving the left upper lobe (Figure 1). The dyspnea and shortness of breath worsened in the next days, and the patient was admitted to our hospital on February 8, 2018 for further examination.\n\nFigure 1 Multiple massive or patchy high-density shadows in the left upper lobe of the lung before any treatment (red circle).\n\nOn admission, laboratory investigations were as follows: hemoglobin, 13.2\u2009g/dL; hematocrit, 38.4%; platelets, 25.1 \u00d7 104/\u00b5L; massive proteinuria (5.2\u2009g/day) without hematuria; leukocytes, 7,600/\u00b5L (72% neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes); total protein, 5.33\u2009g/dL; albumin, 2.75\u2009g/dL; total cholesterol, 0.27\u2009g/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 31.7\u2009mg/dL; Scr, 0.92\u2009mg/dL; C3, 131\u2009mg/dL; C4, 32\u2009mg/dL; IgG, 794\u2009mg/dL; IgA, 109\u2009mg/dL; IgM, 165\u2009mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 41\u2009mm/h.

Then chest CT scan was performed and presented no improvement of the nodules involving the left upper lobe (Figure 2a). At this time, serum cryptococcal antigen revealed positive. To confirm the diagnosis, a CT-guided lung biopsy was performed, and fresh lung tissue was submitted for fungal culture. Pathologic examination of the tissue biopsy revealed multiple round shape organisms. The capsules of the observed organisms could be visualized by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and periodic acid-silver methenamine (PASM) staining, which is compatible with Cryptococcus spp. (Figure 3). The tissue fungal culture showed Cryptococcus neoformans, and the chest abnormality was diagnosed as pulmonary cryptococcosis. Furthermore, lumbar puncture and examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were performed. CSF culture for fungus and cryptococcal antigen were all negative.\n\nFigure 2 (a) Multiple massive or patchy high-density shadows in the left upper lobe of the lung.

Considering the massive proteinuria at this patient, the administration of oral CsA was maintained at a fixed dose of 75\u2009mg/12\u2009h as before hospitalization. On March 1, a second chest CT showed a decrease in the size of the nodule in the area of left upper lobe (Figure 2b) and serum cryptococcal antigen was negative. On the contrary, interestingly, the amount of proteinuria decreased after the initiation of anti-fungal administration, and subsequently normalized. The patient was discharged on March 5 and he took the oral fluconazole tablets at the same dose for 9 months with regular follow-up. The other two chest CT scans in September and December 2018, respectively, revealed complete remission of the lesion in the left upper lobe (Figure 2c and d). To date, relapse of pulmonary cryptococcosis has not been seen in the ambulatory patient.\n\n\nEthical approval: The research related to human use has complied with all the relevant national regulations and institutional policies, and is in accordance to the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration and has been approved by the authors\u2019 institutional review board or equivalent committee.\n\n\nInformed consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and all accompanying images.

In humans, it is usually caused by the following two subspecies of the Cryptococcus spp. family: C. neoformans and C. gattii [6,7]. C. neoformans can cause cryptococcosis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, whereas C. gattii usually infects apparently immunocompetent. Once inhaled into the human host, it colonizes the pulmonary system. The infection can either localize or disseminate through blood to various organs, depending on patients\u2019 immune status. In humans, C. neoformans can cause cryptococcal meningitis and wound or cutaneous cryptococcosis except for pulmonary cryptococcosis [8].\n\nIn the present case report, the patient was diagnosed as MN and presented with pulmonary cryptococcosis caused by C. neoformans without cryptococcal meningitis or cutaneous cryptococcosis. The reports of pulmonary fungal infection in patients with kidney disease are increasing in recent years, for example, kidney transplant patients [9]. The confirmed risk factors cited for fungal infection in kidney transplant patients include demographic (race and older age), medication-associated (immunosuppressive agents), and clinical data (diabetes, urinary tract infection, bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia, and leukopenia/pancytopenia), as well as organism-specific factors [9]. Wang et al. concluded that\u2009 immunoglobulin G titer, plasma CsA concentration, serum creatinine level, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and plasma albumin level were the risk factors of pulmonary infection in primary MN receiving CysA [10]. In recent years, there are some reports of fungal infection in dialysis patients [11] as well as in non-dialyzing uremia [12,13]. Abbott reported that diabetes, female patients, decreasedweight, serum creatinine at initial of dialysis, chronic obstructive lung disease, and AIDS were associated with fungal infection in dialysis patients [11]. Only a few reports have described the relationship between glomerular diseases with or without nephrotic syndrome and fungal infections, e.g., minor glomerular abnormality associated with pulmonary cryptococcosis [14], membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with Candida endocrinopathy [15], crescentic glomerulonephritis with pulmonary aspergillosis [16], necrotizing glomerulonephritis with pulmonary cryptococcosis [17], and minimal change nephrotic syndrome with cutaneous cryptococcosis published in recent years [18]. In our case, the patient lived in the countryside near mountains, and 6 months before the onset of his chest tightness and shortness of breath, he hunted pheasants many times. His cryptococcosis may be related to this kind of wild bird. Besides, he had been taking oral immunosuppressive agents for more than 10 years, which may cause an immunocompromised host and can be associated with the infectious diseases. Combined with nephrotic syndrome and hypoproteinemia, the malnutrition may also contribute to the patient\u2019s pathological condition. Accordingly, the patient\u2019s definite cause of the development of pulmonary cryptococcosis remains unknown.\n\nWhat needs to be mentioned is that the correlation between different immunosuppressive agents and cryptococcal infection is distinct. Some studies show that not all immunosuppressive agents would increase the incidence of cryptococcal infection. Mody et al. demonstrated that CsA treatment of mice enhanced survival after inoculation of Cryptococcus neoformans by both the intratracheal (IT) and intravenous (IV) routes [19]. Next year he demonstrated that CsA was effective for the treatment of extraneural cryptococcal infection in normal mice [20]. Odom et al. found that growth of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans was sensitive to CsA and FK506 at 37\u00b0C but not at 24\u00b0C, suggesting that CsA and FK506 inhibit a protein required for C. neoformans growth at elevated temperature [21]. These findings identify CsA as a potential antifungal drug. However, CsA was also reported to exacerbate cryptococcal meningitis in both mice and rabbits, most likely because CsA does not effectively penetrate the CNS [21,22]. Complex phenomena require more in-depth research to clarify. Leitheiser et al. assessed the risk factors associated with invasive fungal infections in kidney transplant patients, which suggested that CsA were not associated with increased risk for any patients, neither in Histoplasmosis and Aspergillosis groups nor in Candida, Cryptococcosis, and \u201cOther\u201d mycoses groups [9]. However, Wang and his colleagues reported that the plasma concentration of CsA was associated with pulmonary infections [10].\n\nAccording to the related article for the management of pulmonary cryptococcosis in asymptomatic non-immunosuppressed patients, localized cryptococcal infection can be treated with fluconazole alone (200\u2013400\u2009mg/day orally) for 6 months [23]. For mild-to-moderate symptoms, administer fluconazole (400\u2009mg/day orally) for 6\u201312 months. Persistently positive of serum cryptococcal antigen titers are not criteria for continuance of therapy. For severe disease, treatment is similar to disseminated cryptococcosis, as follows: the treatment is divided into induction therapy, consolidation therapy, and maintenance therapy. Induction therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBD) 0.5\u20131.0\u2009mg/kg/day plus flucytosine (100\u2009mg/kg/day) for at least 4 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with fluconazole (400\u2009mg/day orally) for 8 weeks, and maintenance therapy with fluconazole (200\u2009mg/day) for a total duration of 6\u201312 months [1]. We treated the patient with fluconazole alone (200\u2009mg/day) for nearly 9 months and saw a rapid clinical response to fluconazole. Interestingly, the decrease in the severity of proteinuria was in parallel with improvement of pulmonary cryptococcosis.\n\nIn the case, the MN of this patient was a unique aspect. Proteinuria relapsed 1 month before the cryptococcal infection, and proteinuria remission almost coincided with the lung infection control. Whether some causal relationship exits is not clear. Probably, the relapse of nephrotic syndrome in this case is related to cryptococcal infection. It could not be demonstrated because the dose of CsA did not change in the whole course of antifungal treatment. Kidney biopsy puncture could be the useful method to clarify the causal relationship if cryptococcal antigens are found in kidney tissue. To provide the best treatment, more careful clinical consideration and study are needed when encountering similar problems in the future.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Dr Zhang, 81603572), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Dr Xia, LQ19H290003), Project of Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Zhejiang Province of China (Dr Xia, 2017ZA053), and Foundation of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (Dr Xia, 2018ZG04).\n\n\nConflict of interest: The authors state no conflict of interest.\n\n\nData availability statement: The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.",

A specific antigenic target, astrocytic water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has already been identified, and it can be recognized explicitly by the autoantibody marker NMO-IgG. Along with the immune attacks, clinical disabilities would gradually accumulate. As there has been no validated and well-recognized therapy for NMO till now, preventing and postponing attack using immunosuppressive therapies is the primary treatment option.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn the current retrospective study, the effect of immunosuppressive agents was investigated through a long-term follow-up. To assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of rituximab (RTX), azathioprine (AZA), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapies, all 129 patients with NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) who received at least one of these treatments were studied, including 55 seropositive for AQP4-Ab and 74 seronegative for AQP4-Ab.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median post-treatment annualized relapse rate (ARR) was lower than the pre-treatment rates in all AQP4+Ab groups (from 1.0 to 0.7 in RTX, from 0.8 to 0.3 in AZA, and from 0.85 to 0.35 in MMF). Meanwhile, the ARR also decreased in all AQP4-Ab groups (from 0.3 to 0.2 in RTX, from 0.9 to 0.5 in AZA, and from 0.9 to 0.4 in MMF). Disability condition improved in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in all AQP4+Ab groups (from 4.0 to 2.75 in RTX, from 3.5 to 2.5 in AZA, and from 3.0 to 2.0 in MMF) and in all AQP4-Ab groups (from 3.0 to 2.5 in RTX, from 3.0 to 2.5 in AZA, and from 3.5 to 2.0 in MMF). There was no statistically significant difference between the post-treatment and pre-treatment changes of EDSS and ARR in the RTX, AZA, and MMF groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05). However, according to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, RTX-treated patients were more likely to be relapse-free after long-term follow-up than those who received AZA or MMF therapy. Meanwhile, adverse effects were noted in three out of 23 patients with RTX treatment, five of 32 with AZA treatment, and three of 21 with MMF treatment. No serious adverse events were observed in all treatment groups during the study.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRTX, AZA, and MMF therapies efficiently lowered the relapse frequency and disability in both of the AQP4-Ab seropositive or seronegative patients with NMO. Furthermore, low dosage of RTX is recommended for the patients with NMO owing to its long-term effectiveness and safety.\n\nTEXT:\npmcKey Summary Points\n\nRituximab (RTX), azathioprine (AZA), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) are effective, with significant improvements in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and annualized relapse rate (ARR), regardless of the seropositive or seronegative aquaporin-4 antibody status.\t\nRTX is recommended as the first-line therapy in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders rather than AZA and MMF, in view of its effectiveness and safety.\t\nLow dosage of RTX could be recommended for patients with neuromyelitis optica owing to its long-term effectiveness and safety.\t\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs an idiopathic autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) mainly affects the optic nerve and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS). NMO is a severe and slow recovery disorder, compared to multiple sclerosis (MS). Identification of astrocytic water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) made NMO the first CNS autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease that has an identified specific antigenic target. The pathogenesis of NMO is related to AQP4 specific antibody (AQP4-immunoglobulin\u00a0G [IgG]) that differentiates NMO from MS [1, 2]. NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) include AQP4-Ab seropositive patients with optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, diencephalon, brainstem, and cerebral syndromes. AQP4-Ab seropositivity in NMO or NMOSD is predictive of further relapses [3, 4]. Fifty percent of patients are wheelchair-dependent, and 62% are functionally blind without treatment during the first 5\u00a0years. Thus, in patients with NMOSD, the primary treatment goal is attack prevention with immunosuppressive therapy or use of a monoclonal antibody such rituximab (RTX) [5]. The most commonly used drugs in China are azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and RTX. In recent years, research has confirmed the effectiveness and safety of AZA, MMF, and RTX in the treatment of NMOSD. Moreover, AZA [6] and MMF [7\u201310] have been widely used, while corticosteroids [11], mitoxantrone [12, 13], cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporin can also be considered. Thus, RTX has been gradually used as first-line choice for NMO treatment, to seek better control of the disease [14\u201324].\n\nRTX, a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, was initially used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma [25]. The efficiency of RTX in the treatment of NMO/NMOSD has been proven, with defined depletion of memory B\u00a0cells as a therapeutic target [17, 20]. However, when used to treat other autoimmune diseases, adverse effects are reported, most frequently including chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, bronchitis, gingivitis, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Nevertheless, compared with other immunosuppressive agents, AZA, MMF, and RTX are still considered to bear fewer side effects [7, 12, 18, 20, 25]. However, the treatment response of immunosuppressive agents between aquaporin-4 antibody positive and negative status in patients with NMOSD, and the long-term effects of immunosuppressive agents in preventing NMO attacks remain controversial.\n\nThough the effectiveness and acceptable safety of treatment with repeated cycles of RTX and long-term treatment with AZA or MMF have been shown by available clinical data, their long-term effectiveness and safety in patients with NMO need to be further determined. Furthermore, taking the high price of RTX and potential adverse effects into consideration, lower dosages of RTX for the treatment of NMOSD have been selected. In this study, differences in the effectiveness and safety associated with lower dosage of RTX (500\u00a0mg infused, then 100\u00a0mg if the percentage of CD19+ B\u00a0cells reached 1%) [18] have been compared with AZA (2\u00a0mg/kg daily) and MMF (1000\u00a0mg daily) treatments assessed in Chinese patients with NMOSD with seropositive and seronegative AQP-4 antibodies in a median 90-month follow-up.\n\nMethods\n\nA retrospective review of medical records from the Chinese PLA General Hospital showed that 129 patients with NMOSD (all met the international consensus diagnostic criteria) [21, 26] were treated with immunosuppressive drugs and also oral steroids from January 2008 to November 2018. The baseline clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in Table\u00a01.Table\u00a01 Clinical characteristics of the patients with NMOSD receiving rituximab, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil treatment according to seropositive and seronegative AQP4-Ab status\n\n\tRTX (n\u2009=\u200923)\tAZA (n\u2009=\u200932)\tMMF (n\u2009=\u200921)\tp value\t\nAQP4-Ab\t\u2009+\u2009\t\u2212\t\u2009+\u2009\t\u2212\t\u2009+\u2009\t\u2212\t\t\nn\t14\t9\t13\t19\t8\t13\t\t\nAge at onset, median, years (range)\t32.0 (23\u201336)\t29.0 (12\u201339)\t34.0 (33\u201350)\t37.0 (18\u201376)\t38.0 (12\u201350)\t37.0 (24\u201371)\t0.79\t\nFemale gender, n (%)\t12 (86%)\t8 (89%)\t11 (85%)\t14 (74%)\t7 (88%)\t10 (77%)\t0.08\t\nDisease duration, median, years (range)\t12.4 (8\u201315)\t10.1 (8\u201312)\t11.9 (7\u201313)\t10.8 (6\u201315)\t11.5 (5\u201312)\t10.0 (8\u201313)\t0.12\t\nTime since last relapse (months)\t15.9 (13.3)\t17.1 (14.8)\t20.8 (19.6)\t15.1 (17.3)\t18.2 (14.1)\t19.2 (21.3)\t0.93\t\nClinical features\t\n\u00a0Optic neuritis, n (%)\t12 (86%)\t6 (67%)\t9 (69%)\t15 (79%)\t6 (75%)\t10 (77%)\t0.41\t\n\u00a0Myelitis, n (%)\t13 (93%)\t7 (78%)\t12 (92%)\t16 (84%)\t7 (86%)\t12 (92%)\t0.86\t\n\u00a0Associated other autoimmune disease n (%)\t5 (36%)\t4 (44%)\t6 (46%)\t4 (21%)\t3 (38%)\t2 (20%)\t0.07\t\n\u00a0Oral prednisolone dose before immunosuppressant drugs therapy (mean, mg/day)\t16.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.7\t12.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7\t18.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0\t10.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7\t11.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\t12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2\t0.24\t\n\u00a0Oral prednisolone dose after immunosuppressant drugs therapy (mean, mg/day)\t13.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.7\t16.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6\t16.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7\t11.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\t12.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8\t11.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1\t0.19\t\n\u00a0Baseline EDSS before treatment, median (range)\t4.0 (3.5\u20135.5)\t3.0a1 (1.5\u20134.5)\t3.5 (2\u20134.5)\t3.0a3 (2\u20135.5)\t3.0b1 (2.0\u20134.0)\t3.5a5,b3 (2.0\u20134.0)\t0.23\t\n\u00a0Baseline ARR before treatment, median (range)\t1.0 (0.2\u20133)\t0.3a2 (0.2\u20131.5)\t0.8 (0.3\u20131.3)\t0.9a4 (0.5\u20131.3)\t0.85b2 (0.5\u20131.5)\t0.9a6,b4 (0.4\u20131.5)\t0.18\t\nPatients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) who tested seropositive or seronegative for the aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) were divided into three groups based on immunosuppressant therapy initiation. There was no significant difference of baseline characteristics among these patients who received RTX, AZA, and MMF therapies (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference in oral prednisone dose before and after RTX, AZA, and MMF immunosuppressant therapy among patients with NMOSD with seropositive and seronegative AQP4-Ab (p\u2009>\u20090.05). The titer of antibody more than or equal to 1:100 was recognized as a seropositive status\n\nRTX rituximab, AZA azathioprine, MMF mycophenolate mofetil, AQP4 aquaporin-4, EDSS Expanded Disability Status Scale, ARR annualized relapse rate\n\naP value was calculated between seropositive AQP4 antibody and seronegative AQP4 antibody in RTX, AZA, and MMF groups, respectively (P a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6\u2009>\u20090.05)\n\nbP value was calculated among the three groups with RTX, AZA, and MMF, respectively, in seropositive AQP4 antibody and seronegative AQP4 antibody groups (P b1, b2, b3, b4\u2009>\u20090.05)\n\nA total of 129 patients with NMOSD who were previously treated with immunosuppressive medicine and who had concomitant prednisone had received the AQP-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) detection, including 55 patients seropositive for AQP4-Ab and 74 seronegative for AQP4-Ab (Fig.\u00a01). Among the 55 patients in the AQP4-Ab positive group, 14 received low-dose RTX (500\u00a0mg infused, then 100\u00a0mg if the percentage of CD19+ B\u00a0cells reached 1%) (equivalent to 375\u00a0mg/m2 by drip infusion every week for 4\u00a0weeks; this regimen was based on that for treatment of B\u00a0cell lymphoma) [15], 13 patients received azathioprine (2\u00a0mg/kg daily), and eight patients received MMF (1000\u00a0mg daily). Every patient remained on the same low-dosage regimen and the patients received treatment as soon as possible, and they underwent long-term follow-up after the drug treatment.Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study\n\nThe remaining 20 of 55 records in the AQP4-Ab positive group were excluded (ten patients received Chinese traditional medicine therapy, eight received only a small prednisolone dosage, and two received no other therapy). Among the 74 patients in the AQP4-Ab negative group, nine received low-dose RTX, 19 patients received azathioprine, and 13 patients received MMF. The remaining 33 of 74 records were excluded (17 patients received Chinese traditional medicine, ten received only a small prednisolone dosage, and six received no other therapy) (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a01). The quantitative change in anti-AQP4 antibody levels was measured by using a cell-based assay (CBA) [27]. The cutoff level was 50.0\u00a0U/ml, and an antibody titer of more than or equal to 1:100 was recognized as a seropositive status. In addition, a flow cytometry analysis was performed in RTX-treated patients before the first infusion as the baseline level and at 1, 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months. All the patients in this group were infused with RTX at 500\u00a0mg, then 100\u00a0mg re-injected if the percentage of CD19+ B\u00a0cells reached 1%. This study was approved by the Chinese PLA General Hospital Ethical Review Board (IRB No. S2020-042-02), and all patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study.\n\nDescriptive statistical methods were utilized to report frequencies and distribution of the results and means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). For categorical data analysis, a chi-square test was used, and the means among continuous variables were adopted and tested for normal distribution (Shapiro\u2013Wilk test). Parametric tests were utilized for continuous variables that were normally distributed, otherwise non-parametric tests were used. Non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank sum and Kruskal\u2013Wallis test) were applied to compare pre-treatment and post-treatment relapse rates and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. The EDSS, performed by a neurologist, was also registered for each patient. A Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve was prepared on the basis of estimates. SPSS software version 14.0 was used to perform all statistical analyses. P\u00a0values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nBaseline Clinical Characteristics of Patients with NMOSD\n\nThe baseline clinical characteristics of the patients with NMOSD are shown in Table\u00a01. A total of 129 patients were enrolled in the study with 55 seropositive and 74 seronegative AQP4-Ab, including 23 patients in the RTX group with 14 seropositive and nine seronegative AQP4-Ab, 32 patients in the AZA group with 13 seropositive and 19 seronegative AQP4-Ab, 21 patients in the MMF group with eight seropositive and 13 seronegative AQP4-Ab (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a01). The median onset age was 32\u00a0years old (range 23\u201336), with 12 women (86%), and the median disease duration was 12.4\u00a0years (range 8\u201315) in the RTX group with seropositive AQP4-Ab. Optic neuritis (n\u2009=\u200912, 86%) and acute myelitis (n\u2009=\u200913, 93%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Five (36%) patients were associated with other autoimmune diseases. The median EDSS score was 4.0 (3.5\u20135.5) before treatment with RTX.\n\nThe median onset age was 34\u00a0years old (range 33\u201350), with 11 women (85%), and the median disease duration was 11.9\u00a0years (range 7\u201313) in the AZA group with seropositive AQP4-Ab. Optic neuritis (n\u2009=\u20099, 69%) and acute myelitis (n\u2009=\u200912, 92%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Six (46%) patients were associated with other autoimmune diseases. The median EDSS score was 3.5 (2\u20134.5) before treatment with AZA.\n\nThe median onset age was 38\u00a0years old (range 12\u201350), with seven female patients (88%), and the median disease duration was 11.5\u00a0years (range 5\u201312) in the MMF group with seropositive AQP4-Ab. Optic neuritis (n\u2009=\u20096, 75%) and acute myelitis (n\u2009=\u20097, 86%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Three (38%) patients were associated with other autoimmune diseases. The median EDSS score was 3.0 (2.0\u20134.0) before treatment with MMF.\n\nOn the basis of the aforementioned analysis results, there was no significant difference in baseline characteristics among these patients who received RTX, AZA, and MMF therapy (P\u2009>\u20090.05). In addition, all patients were taking prednisolone at enrollment, and there was no significant different oral prednisone dose before and after RTX, AZA, and MMF immunosuppressant therapy among patients with NMOSD with seropositive and seronegative AQP4-Ab (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Nevertheless, the basal characteristics were lacking epidemiological and radiological variables.\n\nEffectiveness of Rituximab, Azathioprine, and Mycophenolate Mofetil Treatment in Patients with NMOSD\n\nIn the group treated with RTX, the EDSS scores decreased from a pre-treatment value of 4.0 (3.5\u20135.5) to a post-treatment value of 4.0 (3.5\u20135.5) at the last follow-up (median 90\u00a0months). The annual relapse rates (ARR) before treatment were defined as the ARR calculated before the first injection. ARR after treatment was defined as the ARR calculated between the first injection and the last follow-up. As a result, the median post-treatment ARR was 0.7(0.1\u20132), compared with the pre-treatment value of 1.0 (0.2\u20133) in the RTX group with seropositive AQP4-Ab (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank sum test). Meanwhile, the EDSS scores decreased from a pre-treatment score of 3.0 (1.5\u20134.5) to a post-treatment score of 2.5 (1.5\u20133.5) at the last follow-up (median 90\u00a0months). As a result, the median post-treatment ARR was 0.2 (0.1\u20130.6), compared with the pre-treatment rate 0.3 (0.2\u20131.5) in the RTX group with seronegative AQP4-Ab (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank sum test).\n\nIn the group treated with AZA, the EDSS scores decreased from a pre-treatment value of 2.5 (2.0\u20133.5) to a pre-treatment score of 3.5 (2.0\u20134.5). The median post-treatment ARR was 0.3 (0.1\u20131.0), compared with the pre-treatment rate of 0.8 (0.3\u20131.3) in the AZA group with seropositive AQP4-Ab (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank sum test). Meanwhile, the EDSS scores decreased from a pre-treatment score of 3.0 (2.0\u20135.5) to a post-treatment score of 2.5 (1.0\u20134.0) at the last follow-up (median 90\u00a0months). The median post-treatment ARR was 0.5 (0.2\u20131.0), compared with the pre-treatment rate of 0.9 (0.5\u20131.3) in the AZA group with seronegative AQP4-Ab (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank sum test).\n\nIn the group treated with MMF, the EDSS scores decreased from a pre-treatment score of 3.0 (2.0\u20134.0) to a post-treatment score of 2.0 (1.5\u20132.5). The median post-treatment ARR was 0.35 (0.1\u20131.0), compared with the pre-treatment rate of 0.85 (0.5\u20131.5) in the MMF group with seropositive AQP4-Ab (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank sum test). Meanwhile, the EDSS scores decreased from a pre-treatment score of 3.5 (2.0\u20134.0) to a post-treatment score of 2.0 (1.5\u20133.5) at the last follow-up (median 90\u00a0months). The median post-treatment ARR was 0.4 (0.2\u20130.9), compared with the pre-treatment rate of 0.9 (0.4\u20131.5) in the MMF group with seronegative AQP4-Ab (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank sum test).

Medical record reviews in these patients provided the post-treatment follow-up data. The median follow-up of all patients was 90 (68\u2013104) months. There were 76 patients with NMOSD treated with these three drugs at the last review; owing to the low incidence of this disorder and dropout, patients received other therapy. In the last review, there were 23, 32, and 21 patients treated with RTX, AZA, and MMF, respectively, with a median duration of 18 (12\u201349), 25 (18\u201351), and 22 (12\u201348) months treatment. EDSS and ARR after initiation of RTX, AZA, and MMF until the last follow-up were analyzed. The EDSS reduction ratios were 0.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23, 0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19, and 0.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13, and ARR reduction ratios were 0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11 (RTX), 0.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 (AZA), and 0.09\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 (MMF), respectively. The changes of EDSS and relapses rates were shown before and after treatment. There was a significant reduction compared with the pre-treatment values in EDSS and ARR (P\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table\u00a02, Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary Figs.\u00a01 and 2). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the post-treatment and pre-treatment changes of EDSS and ARR in RTX, AZA, and MMF groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table\u00a02, Fig.\u00a03).

Furthermore, 87% (20/23) of patients reported no adverse effects following RTX therapy (very low dose used).\n\nTwo (6.3%) patients treated with AZA had low counts of white blood cells and three (9.3%) experienced liver dysfunction; one (4.8%) patient treated with MMF had low counts of white blood cells and two (9.5%) experienced liver dysfunction. No case had hematological malignancy during the 90\u00a0months follow-up. Furthermore, there were no serious side effecs reported in the three groups (Table\u00a03).Table\u00a03 Side effects of immunosuppressive treatment in patients with NMOSD during long-term follow-up\n\n\tRTX (n\u2009=\u200923)\tAZA (n\u2009=\u200932)\tMMF (n\u2009=\u200921)\t\nAQP4-Ab\t\u2009+\u2009\t\u2212\t\u2009+\u2009\t\u2212\t\u2009+\u2009\t\u2212\t\nn\t14\t9\t13\t19\t8\t13\t\nAdverse events frequently reported\t1\t2\t3\t2\t2\t1\t\nRebound of relapse after withdrawal\t1\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\nInfection\t1 (gingivitis, 7.7%)\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\nBlood routine (LWBC)\t0\t0\t2 (6.3%)\t0\t1 (4.8%)\t0\t\nLiver dysfunction\t0\t0\t0\t0\t2 (9.5%)\t0\t\nHematological malignancy\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\nAn antibody titer of more than or equal to 1:100 was recognized as a seropositive status\n\nRTX rituximab, AZA azathioprine, MMF mycophenolate mofetil, EDSS Expanded Disability Status Scale, ARR annualized relapse rate, LWBC low white blood cell counts\n\nKaplan\u2013Meier Survival Analysis\n\nThe Kaplan\u2013Meier survival estimates indicated significant differences in relapse rates among the subjects treated with RTX, AZA, and MMF (P\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a04). Namely, RTX-treated patients were more likely to be relapse-free after long-term follow-up than those who received AZA or MMF therapy.Fig. 4 Kaplan\u2013Meier survival estimates pertaining to probabilities of being without relapse after RTX (rituximab, top line), AZA (azathioprine, middle line), and MMF (mycophenolate mofetil, bottom line) treatment. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival estimates indicated significant differences in relapse rates between RTX- and AZA-treated subjects, and in relapse rates between RTX- and MMF-treated subjects, but not significant difference in relapse rates between MMF- and AZA-treated subjects. Namely, RTX-treated patients were more likely to be relapse-free after long-term follow-up than those who received AZA or MMF therapy (log rank p\u2009<\u20090.05)\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, Chinese patients with NMOSD and either AQP4-Ab seropositive or seronegative status were enrolled, and their immunosuppressant therapies were studied. As the latest diagnostic criteria for NMOSD in 2015 included seropositive AQP4-Ab status [26], seropositive AQP4-Ab patients with NMO and high disease activity could more easily relapse and should be carefully followed and managed. Thus, it is essential to assess the long-term effects and safety of NMO with immunosuppressant treatment between AQP4-Ab seropositive and negative status.\n\nPrevious studies have illustrated that the estimated risk of relapsing was 30% after 5\u00a0years without immunosuppressant therapy and 50% after 10\u00a0years [6]. Further, our research team had determined that 12.1% of patients with initial optical neuritis (ON) attacks could progress to NMO within 5\u00a0years [28]. Our current study involved a median of 90\u00a0months\u2019 follow-up of patients with NMO to investigate the associated clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis. In this study, the tolerance of RTX was good in most cases and had acceptable safety results, and it effectively decreased disability scores (EDSS) and relapse rates (ARR). Moreover, there were significant differences in the post-treatment and pre-treatment changes of EDSS and ARR with RTX either in the AQP4+ or AQP4\u2212antibody group. These results support that RTX, a drug efficiently used in demyelinating spectrum diseases [22], could also treat patients with NMOSD. The present retrospective research summarized the treatment experience at our clinic with these drugs. Low-dose RTX, AZA, and MMF therapies were all effective in reducing relapse and improving or stabilizing the disabilities, regardless of seropositive or negative AQP4-Ab status, as shown by the improvements in the EDSS and ARR. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the post-treatment and pre-treatment changes of EDSS and ARR among RTX, AZA, and MMF groups.\n\nAs a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20+ B\u00a0cells, rituximab has been used to prevent NMO attacks [16]. The precise mechanism of the effect of rituximab in people with NMO has not been established, though the depletion of B\u00a0cells is recognized as an effective target [15]. RTX treatment causes depletion of CD20+ and CD19+ B\u00a0cells. In a recent randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, rituximab completely prevented relapses in all patients with NMO and seronegative AQP4-Ab status [15]. In our study, the improvement of EDSS and the rate of reduction in risk of relapse were apparent in both seropositive and seronegative patients.\n\nRTX has a potential beneficial effect; however, it requires intravenous infusions and is associated with infection risk that may limit its use, especially in treating NMO as a first-class agent. According to our study, although no significant difference was observed among the RTX, MMF, and AZA groups in EDSS and ARR values at pre-post treatment, the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival estimates indicated there were significant differences in relapse rates among the subjects treated with RTX, AZA, and MMF, and RTX-treated patients were more likely to be relapse-free after long-term follow-up than those who received AZA or MMF therapy. For this reason, on the basis of our study, AZA or MMF may also produce adverse effects rather than serious side effects. In total, 87% (20/23) of patients reported no adverse effects following RTX therapy (low dose used). In most patients, the use of RTX was limited because of the high cost and the need to monitor CD19+ lymphocytes with flow cytometry analysis [7, 18, 25].\n\nMoreover, less than 6.3% of our patients experienced low white blood cell counts, and less than 7.7% experienced infection (such as gingivitis). Therefore, patients and physicians need to be aware of the long-term risks of hematological malignancies. Although we have not found hematological malignancy cases, the awareness of the risk should be emphasized.\n\nWe also note the limitations of our study such as the small sample size, the lack of a randomized placebo-controlled design, and lack of the basal epidemiological and radiological characters. Also, concomitant treatments may preclude a definitive evaluation of the efficacy of RTX, AZA, and MMF in NMO relapse prevention [29]. In addition, a washout period to eliminate the influence of prior therapies was absent. Finally, there were more seronegative patients with NMOSD than seropositive ones in this cohort, and the presence of other independent disease groups in the seronegative NMOSD group may substantially affect the results.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur findings suggest that RTX, MMF, and AZA are all effective in patients with NMOSD both in seropositive and seronegative AQP4-Ab status. Specifically, RTX-treated patients were more likely to be relapse-free after long-term follow-up. Thus, despite the mentioned limitations, this study provided evidence supporting the use of RTX, AZA, and MMF to prevent NMO attacks. RTX, AZA, and MMF seemed to be effective, even with or without oral prednisone administration; however, the effectiveness, cost, and adverse effects associated with these treatments, and the urgency to achieve immediate immunosuppression, could practically affect the choice of treatment. Nevertheless, RTX should be recommended owing to its long-term efficacy and safety. Further research is ongoing that is based on part of these individual cases generated by our clinical database.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.Supplementary file1 (PDF 379 KB)\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis study was carried out with the adequate understanding and consent of the patients.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nIbuprofen induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and liver injury in children: a case report.\n\nABSTRACT:\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a disorder that causes severe damage to the skin and mucous membranes with bullous and erosive properties. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is closely related to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen). Liver injury caused by ibuprofen is often related to overdose, and liver injury caused by normal dose is rare, and there are individual differences in different situations. In this case, a child developed SJS and acute liver injury after treatment with ibuprofen suspension. We described the characteristics of related adverse reactions induced by ibuprofen, and analyzed the relationship between SJS caused by the drug and related drug genes. Glucocorticoids and antihistamines were used to treat dermatitis, reduced glutathione (GSH) to protect the liver and plasma exchange detoxification. Finally, the patient's dermatitis healed and the liver injury was significantly improved. Many studies have suggested that DILI may be related to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping. The detection of drug-related genes revealed that the SJS and liver damage caused by ibuprofen might have been related to the positive HLA-B*5801. This article suggests that attention should be paid to checking liver function indicators after taking ibuprofen, and genetic screening can be used to reduce the risk of gene-related adverse reactions when necessary.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nIbuprofen, organically known as (2RS)-1-(4-[2-methyl propyl])phenyl, is a common over-the-counter analgesic with good anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. It is a propionic acid derivative and is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (1). The NSAIDs exert anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects by suppressing prostaglandin (PG) synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).\n\nIbuprofen is widely used in children because of its rapid fever reduction and good curative effects. The incidence of DILI is often closely related to ibuprofen, but the prevalence of DILI caused by ibuprofen is not high (2). It is generally believed that it is one of the safest antipyretic drugs, and the drug has the highest benefit/risk ratio. Nevertheless, when evaluating potential cases of hepatotoxicity, ibuprofen-related DILI also requires full attention, which usually manifests as liver cell damage. Some adverse drug reactions (ADR) have been reported recently in the literature, such as gastrointestinal tract irritation, peptic ulcer, high level of transaminase, and rash. Bronchospasm and allergic nephritis are among other relatively rare adverse reactions. Liver cell injury is the most common type of disease. Severe patients can even develop into acute liver failure leading to death.\n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a serious adverse skin reaction, but it is relatively rare, with an annual incidence of only 1\u20132/1,000,000, which is regarded as a medical emergency. NSAIDs are listed as high-risk drugs to induce SJS (3).\n\nThis article described a child who developed SJS and liver injury after taking ibuprofen suspension (Johnson & Johnson, H19991011) and discussed the case combined with the literature. We also summarized the experience of diagnosing and treating severe adverse reactions to Ibuprofen to improve medical staff understanding of ADR and strengthen the clinical application of pharmacogenomics.\n\nWe present the following case following the CARE reporting checklist (available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/tp-21-8).\n\nCase presentation\n\nFemale, 9 years old, the child has no previous special medical history, no concomitant diseases, no history of drug allergy, no liver-related diseases, and no exposure to suspicious drugs before and after the onset of the disease. This child (weight, 27 kg) developed fever without obvious inducement, with the highest temperature of 38.6 \u00b0C, on 4 July 2019. She had taken ibuprofen suspension 3 times and had no abdominal pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, or cough at the beginning of the disease. Unfortunately, we could not determine the time and dose of ibuprofen at that time because the child was not seen in our hospital at that time. Since July 6, the patient developed somnolence, anorexia, abdominal pain, and a small red rash on the neck (Figure 1). At this time, stop ibuprofen and related drugs immediately. She attended Wuxi Children\u2019s Hospital for treatment, and her liver function was shown as abnormal by alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 1416 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 934 U/L), total bilirubin (68.4 \u00b5mol/L), total bile acids (345.1 \u00b5mol/L) and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (669 U/L). Reducing GSH and acetylcysteine was given to protect the liver and lower enzymes. Recurrent abdominal pain persisted, rashes progressively worsened (involving the face, neck, and trunk), and the skin had begun to peel off. From 8 July, she was given cefpiramide sodium, ornidazole, imipenem, and cilastatin for anti-infection and gamma bulb support treatment. She was transferred to our hospital on 11 July 2019 due to \u201cfever for 1 week, abdominal pain, rash, and abnormal liver function for 5 days\u201d. Upon admission examination, the patient presented the following: body temperature: 37.8 \u00b0C, pulse rate 93 beats/min, breathing 24 beats/min, blood pressure: 100/55 mmHg. She was lucid, in good spirits, had no cyanosis of the lips, was showing dense brown skin rashes all over the body (face, neck, and trunk), which did not fade when pressed, an area of peeling on the chest about 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm with no obvious exudation or suppuration, the neck was soft and without resistance, coarse breath sounds in both lungs without rales, uniform heart rhythm, strong heart sounds, reachable level II/III murmurs, flat and soft abdomen, liver palpable 3 cm below ribs, soft texture, spleen not palpable below ribs, physiological reflexes were present, the pathological reflex was not elicited. The laboratory analyses were as follows: white blood cell (WBC), 122.00 g/L; hemoglobin, 212.00\u00d7109/L; neutrophils, 59.5%; lymphocytes, 29.4%; C-reactive protein, 6.2 mg/L. Fecal routine + occult blood testing revealed the following: WBC microscopy (+), occult blood (+). On July 13, 2019, Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that: the liver was slightly enlarged, and the gallbladder was enlarged.

Eosinophils were checked on admission and there was no high level of eosinophils. On July 30, the drug-gene test result was positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5801, suggesting that the HLA-B*5801 allele was carried. The genetic test results are shown in Table 2.

Reduced GSH and adenosylmethionine succinate were administered for 2 weeks, compound glycyrrhizin for 3 weeks, and ursodeoxycholic acid for 4 weeks to protect the liver and promote bile excretion, then plasma exchange was given twice (July 13 to 14, 1,400 mL/time). The use time and dosage of the drug are shown in Figure 2. Mupirocin ointment (SK&F) was applied to the wound, accompanied by gamma globulin, and albumin supportive treatments. The patient\u2019s condition and medication are shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 2 Medication for children in hospital.\n\nFigure 3 Progression of the case according to the time line.\n\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee(s) and with the Helsinki Declaration (as revised in 2013). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSJS is a rare and severe disease, a serious erythema multiforme, characterized by bullous and erosive damage to the skin and mucous membranes. It usually occurs after consuming nonsteroidal drugs, sulfa drugs, penicillin, allopurinol, and anticonvulsants (3). According to the time correlation between children\u2019s medication and the appearance of skin lesions, the possibility of combining SJS with other medications besides ibuprofen can be ruled out.\n\nThe disease SJS is a recognized immune complex-mediated allergic reaction that affects all age groups. It has typical systemic, mucous membrane, and skin damage manifestations. Caproni et al. showed that (4) tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is strongly expressed in SJS lesions and plays an important role in the SJS immune response.\n\nSome studies have reported a close genetic relationship between HLA alleles and drug allergy susceptibility (5,6). These genetic associations may be drug-specific. For example, HLA-B*1502 is related to SJS induced by carbamazepine (6), HLA-B*55:01 is related to penicillin allergy (7), and HLA-B*5801 is related to severe skin adverse reactions induced by allopurinol (6).\n\nThere is a clear correlation between HLA-B*5801 and the severe skin reaction caused by related drugs, while in North Korea, the correlation among Japanese and European populations is relatively weak. The average carrying rate of HLA-B*5801 among Chinese is 8.8\u201310.9% (8). The average mutation carrier rates of the Caucasian, Asian, and African populations are 1\u20136%, 3\u201315%, and 2\u20134%, respectively (9). In this case, the patient carried the HLA-B*5801 genes, it might be a risk factor, more studies should be performed. Therefore, those who carry HLA-B*5801 genes need to be aware of drug-induced SJS when taking nonsteroidal drugs, sulfa drugs, penicillin, allopurinol, and anticonvulsants. The drug treatment of such patients needs to be cautious; attempts must be made to detect drug genes, followed by analysis and administration of individualized drugs.\n\nLiver damage caused by drugs is relatively common, because most drugs are metabolized in the liver, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an uncertain process, requiring a high degree of understanding of the disease and careful exclusion of other causes of liver disease. DILI can usually be divided into two types according to the liver toxicity mechanism. One is dose-related and the other is dose-independent. However, in this case, it is the liver injury induced at normal doses, which only occurs in a small part of the population. Idiosyncratic liver injury is unpredictable (10). In this case, infections such as hepatitis virus, cytomegalovirus, and rubella virus antibody were excluded, as were autoimmune diseases. According to the adverse reaction scoring principle of Naranjo\u2019s evaluation scale (11), the child\u2019s score information was 7 points, which determined the causality as probable.\n\nMany studies have found that HLA genes are related to adverse reactions to many drugs (12). The protein encoded by the HLA gene is a cell surface receptor, which plays a key role in the immune system. Many studies have suggested that DILI may be related to HLA genotyping (13,14). For example, HLA-B*5701 alleles are related to liver damage caused by flucloxacillin, and HLA-A*0201 and HLA-DQB1*0602 alleles are related to drug-induced liver damage caused by amoxicillin-clavulanate (15,16). The gene HLA-A*02:06 is closely related to the adverse reactions caused by acetaminophen (17). However, further investigation is required to determine whether the allergic reaction and liver damage caused by ibuprofen is related to the HLA-B gene. This patient had obvious liver damage. After detecting this child\u2019s relevant HLA gene, the HLA-B*5801 test result was found to be positive. However, there is currently no evidence that there is a link between liver damage and SJS in children with this gene.\n\nIn summary, ibuprofen has a wide range of clinical applications, but it may cause serious adverse reactions among special populations. There are variations in reactions between different individuals. Especially in special populations with polymorphisms in the drug-gene, the probability of skin damage and liver damage after taking the drug may be greatly increased. Clinical medical staff should strengthen their understanding of nonsteroidal drugs and monitor various biochemical indicators during medication time. Once abnormal damage occurs, it can be dealt with accordingly. At present, drug gene testing can be used as predictive biomarkers in clinical practice to avoid ADR. The high sensitivity (18) and specificity of some markers provide a credible basis for developing tests to identify individuals at risk of drug allergy. Drug-specific genetic screening tests can prevent the occurrence of such catastrophic diseases.\n\nSupplementary\n\nThe article\u2019s supplementary files as\n\n10.21037/tp-21-8 10.21037/tp-21-8 10.21037/tp-21-8\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFunding: Shanghai Jiao Tong University Key Laboratory of Genetic Development and Mental and Neurological Diseases of Ministry of Education (No. 2020GDND01); Science Popularization Research Project of National Medical Economic Information Network of Chinese Pharmaceutical Association [No. CMEI2021KPYJ (JZYY) 00202]; Clinical Pharmacy Innovation Research Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (No. CXYJY2019MS003).\n\nEthical Statement: The authors are accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a severe and life-threatening cytokine-associated toxicity that can develop after adoptive T-cell therapy. We herein report a rare case of severe CRS after ICI therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. He presented with a prolonged high fever, cardiogenic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation after the first course of programed death ligand-1 inhibitor and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. He recovered by steroid pulse therapy and tocilizumab. CRS is a rare but life-threatening adverse event of ICI therapy and therefore warrants awareness.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nImmune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a mainstay in cancer treatment. Situations where autoimmune toxicity develops in the context of immune-checkpoint therapy are referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) (1). Various irAEs have been reported, and moderate-to-severe cases can be managed by the administration of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.\n\nCytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a cytokine-associated toxicity observed after administration of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy (2). CRS can be severe and life-threatening. The anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab is an immunosuppressive agent that has shown efficacy for severe CRS (3).\n\nVery rarely, CRS has been reported as a side effect of ICI. We herein report a case of CRS after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy combined with ICI therapy successfully treated by corticosteroids and tocilizumab.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 53-year-old man presented to our hospital with back pain and an abnormal shadow in the upper area of the right lung. He was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma (cT3N3M1c) with distant metastasis to the left adrenal gland and multiple bones.\n\nHe had a history of controlled type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and his Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1. He received radiation therapy (30 Gray) to the 10th thoracic spine before the administration of systemic chemotherapy. Twelve days after he completed radiotherapy, chemotherapy was initiated, comprising cisplatin, pemetrexed, and atezolizumab. As an antiemetic drug, dexamethasone was administered at 12 mg on day 1 and 6 mg on days 2 and 3.\n\nThe patient presented with nausea of Grade 1 on day 1, and there were no remarkable changes in his physical presentation or laboratory data until day 6. On day 7, his body temperature increased to 40\u00b0C. The fever was not ameliorated by the administration of acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. He presented with no focal symptoms other than a fever. Blood and urine cultures were negative.\n\nOn day 10, a rash appeared on his trunk and limbs. Since the high fever continued, full-body computed tomography was performed on day 13, with no evidence of infectious foci. In the afternoon on day 10, his consciousness deteriorated (Glasgow Coma Scale E2V3M4), and he was unable to maintain a seated position. S-ferritin increased to 5,775 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 20.91 mg/dL. His serum glucose level was normal. The lymphocyte count decreased to 180 /\u03bcL, and the platelet count was 68,000 /\u03bcL. The function of the thyroid and adrenal glands was normal.\n\nThe clinical presentation, including the fever, confusion, elevated ferritin, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia, were consistent with systemic immune activation or CRS. For the differential identification of the viral infection, we measured the titer of viral antibodies (EB VCA IgG: 80 times, EB EA: <10 times, EBNA: 2.3 times, and human palbo-virus 19 IgM: 0.30 times). These data did not suggest viral infection as a cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. There was no increase in the levels of serum uric acid, potassium, calcium, or creatinine; we therefore excluded the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome. High-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy was provided with 1,000 mg of methylprednisolone for 3 days. On day 11, his body temperature remained high, around 39\u00b0C; we therefore decided to add 4 mg/kg body weight of tocilizumab according to the strategy for treating CRS (4).\n\nHis body temperature decreased on day 12, but hypotension and tachycardia were observed. On day 15, his blood pressure decreased to approximately 60 mmHg. The heart rate was 110 bpm, and SpO2 was 92% with an oxygen supply of 4 L/min. He was in a state of shock; therefore, hemodynamic support with intravenous fluids followed by vasopressor support with dopamine and noradrenaline was initiated. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed diffuse hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20% after being within the normal range 5 days before. Maximum doses of dopamine and noradrenaline were provided.\n\nOn day 16, his AST and ALT levels increased to 1,468 and 2,537 U/L, respectively. S-ferritin peaked at 56,520 ng/mL, and his renal function worsened (creatinine, 1.44; blood urea nitrogen, 80). X-ray showed congestion, and brain natriuretic peptide increased to 2,259 pg/mL. Electrocardiography revealed no evidence of ischemic change, and the s-creatine kinase level was normal. We therefore considered ischemic heart disease unlikely and he developed acute heart failure - one of the clinical symptoms of CRS.\n\nHis blood pressure gradually increased, and catecholamine therapy was tapered. After high-dose steroids pulse therapy, we decreased the steroid dose to 125 mg prednisolone and continued this dose for 7 days. The CRP level steadily decreased after pulse therapy and the addition of tocilizumab. The IL-6 levels increased from 13.1 pg/mL on the day of tocilizumab initiation to 301 pg/mL after 2 days, but the value subsequently decreased (Fig. 1). Regarding the coagulation function, the fibrinogen level decreased to 53 \u03bcg/mL, and the fibrin degradation product level increased to 50.8 \u03bcg/mL on day 19. He met the diagnosis criteria of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); therefore, we decided to administer fresh-frozen plasma if the DIC state persisted.\n\nFigure 1. Changes in CRP and IL-6 levels. CRP: C-reactive protein, IL-6: interleukin 6\n\nBy day 21, his ejection fraction had recovered to 45%, and dopamine and noradrenaline therapy was discontinued. We decreased the prednisolone dose to 60 mg, with a 5-mg/week tapering regimen. His ejection fraction recovered to 74% on day 25, and the fibrinogen level normalized on day 35. He was discharged from the hospital on day 55. Chemotherapy was re-initiated, including cisplatin and pemetrexed, but no ICIs, and no recurrence of CRS was observed.\n\nThe primary lesion of the lung and adrenal metastasis shrank from 13 and 42 mm before chemotherapy to 10 and 35 mm after the first cycle of chemotherapy, respectively (Fig. 2). He continued to take cisplatin and pemetrexed therapy after discharge, and he ultimately survived for 25 months from the beginning of the first cycle of chemotherapy.\n\nFigure 2. a: Adrenal metastasis before chemotherapy. b: Primary lesion of the lung before chemotherapy. c: Adrenal metastasis on day 57. d: Primary lesion of the lung on day 57.\n\nDiscussion\n\nFor patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, the addition of a programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy has resulted in a significantly higher overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone (5,6).\n\nCRS involves various symptoms, beginning with a fever, and may result in severe multi-organ dysfunction due to a systemic inflammatory response (7). Although a relatively common side effect of CAR-T therapy, CRS appears to be a rare side effect of PD-1 or CTLA-4 inhibitor treatment (2,4,7).\n\nTo our knowledge, there have only been eight reported cases of CRS induced by ICI therapy, including two cases of lung cancer (8,9). CRS is a non-antigen-specific toxicity; hence, the management of this adverse event may be different from that of other irAE. CRS does not exhibit antigenic toxicity and may develop due to the excessive release of inflammatory cytokines by activation of lymphocytes and macrophages in response to ICI therapy. CRS is more commonly associated with mAb infusions and CAR-T therapy than ICI. The activation of immune cells by CRS may be a common factor seen with ICI and other treatments. The mechanisms underlying the CRS-related cytokine release during ICI treatment are unknown; however, the duration of CRS after treatment is sometimes longer in patients undergoing treatment with ICI than in those undergoing treatment with mAbs and CAR-T. This may be due to the magnitude of immune cell activation, as the T-cell activation after mAbs infusions and CAR-T therapy is stronger than that after ICI therapy.\n\nIn the present case, the patient developed a high fever with disturbance of consciousness, acute heart failure, and DIC after chemotherapy containing a PD-L1 inhibitor. The clinical presentation met the criteria of Grade 3 CRS (7). The risk factors of CRS after ICI therapy are unknown, and there are no obvious common features between our case and previously reported cases. In this case, the patients showed high levels of CRP (approximately 7.0 mg/dL) before the initiation of chemotherapy. This suggests that a state of high inflammation might cause CRS, but there is no conclusive evidence to support this notion. The patient recovered after high-dose steroid pulse therapy and the administration of tocilizumab. The recommended first-choice treatment of CAR-T therapy-related CRS is tocilizumab, with corticosteroid therapy being the second choice. However, the pathogenesis of CRS following ICI remains unclear, and no treatment strategy has yet been established. The patient's acute heart failure developed after the decrease in body temperature. Drug-induced heart failure by tocilizumab was unlikely since there were no previous reports on this. He and his family declined to undergo a cardiac catheter test, so we could not test for the existence of coronary artery disease. However, there was no ST-change in the electro-cardiogram and no asynergy of the heart wall during follow-up, so ischemic heart disease was also considered unlikely.\n\nCardiomyopathy is also considered a clinical signs of CRS (4,7). We therefore suspected that the heart failure had been induced by high-load cytokine release. As reported in one previous case (4), the CRP level decreased immediately after the initiation of tocilizumab, and the IL-6 levels increased for a short while after the initiation of IL-6 receptor blockade before then decreasing. This elevation in IL-6 levels after IL-6 receptor blockade is considered to be due to antibodies that bind to IL-6 receptor, thereby temporarily increasing the serum IL-6 levels. In the present case, however, it took several days of tocilizumab treatment to alleviate the CRS symptoms, such as heart failure and DIC. Patients usually recover within a few hours after the administration of tocilizumab; however, symptoms may not always completely resolve, and the administration of a second dose of tocilizumab or a second immune-suppression agent should be considered (4).\n\nIn August 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved tocilizumab for the treatment of CRS following CAR-T therapy (3). In this approval, the recommended dose of tocilizumab was 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients weighing <30 kg). The patient described in this report was treated before this recommendation had been made, so the ideal dose of tocilizumab for CRS was considered to be 4-8 mg/kg (4). We used 4 mg/kg of tocilizumab as the initial dose, but this dose might have been insufficient to achieve the immediate improvement of CRS. Our patient ultimately recovered, but we might have used 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab for the first dose or repeated treatment if prompt improvement could not be obtained.\n\nAnother potential reason for the transitory deterioration after tocilizumab administration might be the development of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (10). MAS is a multi-organ dysfunction due to the release of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. It may develop after tocilizumab therapy for autoimmune diseases, such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and be characterized by hemophagocytosis, hyperferritinemia, liver dysfunction, and coagulopathy. We did not measure the levels of cytokines other than IL-6 and did not perform bone marrow aspiration; therefore, we cannot conclude whether or not MAS occurred in this case.\n\nCRS is a rare but life-threatening complication. The initial symptoms of CRS, such as a high fever and low-blood pressure, mimic more common complications during chemotherapy combined with ICI therapy, including septic shock and adrenal insufficiency. In addition, the pattern of cytokines released in case of CRS induced by ICI is not fully known, so a harmonized treatment strategy remains to be established. It is important to be aware of CRS as a cause of severe multi-organ dysfunction after the initiation of ICI therapy, including a strategy for the treatment of any imminent cytokine storm.\n\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).",

Induction therapy with ATRA is associated with the rare but potentially fatal complication of differentiation syndrome. While the presentation of this syndrome is varied, myopericarditis as a manifestation of differentiation syndrome is often fatal and rarely reported in literature. We present a case of myopericarditis as the sole manifestation of differentiation syndrome in a patient on induction therapy with ATRA and arsenic trioxide for APL.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 62\u2009year old woman with remote history of breast and uterine cancer presented to the hospital for expedited work up of easy bruising and expanding hematomas. She was diagnosed with APL with peripheral blood and bone marrow cytogenetics revealing t (15;17) translocation and initiated on induction therapy with ATRA and ATO as well as steroids for differentiation syndrome prophylaxis. Eighteen days into induction therapy, patient developed pleuritic chest pain, elevated cardiac biomarkers, ECG changes suggestive of pericarditis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed patchy multifocal sub-epicardial late gadolinium enhancement and elevated T2 signal consistent with acute myopericarditis. Given the timing of symptom onset and lack of other identifiable cause, patient was diagnosed with differentiation syndrome- induced myopericarditis and promptly initiated on high dose steroids with rapid improvement in symptoms, ECG, and cardiac biomarkers. Patient successfully resumed dose-reduced ATRA and arsenic trioxide without complication.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMyopericarditis can be the sole manifestation of differentiation syndrome and the presentation may be atypical owing to the use of prophylactic steroids as illustrated in our patient's case. A high index of suspicion for differentiation syndrome, multimodality imaging, and prompt input from multidisciplinary providers is crucial for making the timely diagnosis and initiating life-saving treatment.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nDifferentiation syndrome (DS) is a potentially life-threatening complication of induction therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) [1]. Common cardiac complications of the combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO) include DS-related pericardial effusions and ATO-mediated QT prolongation [2]. Myopericarditis secondary to differentiation syndrome is rarely reported in the literature [3\u20137]. We present an unusual case of myopericarditis as the solitary manifestation of DS in a patient receiving ATRA and ATO for APL.\n\nCase\n\nA 62-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer treated with modified radical mastectomy, chemo-radiotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel) and tamoxifen about seventeen years ago and uterine carcinosarcoma treated with total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and no other pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors presented to our hospital for expedited workup of 1 week of easy bruising and expanding hematomas. Upon presentation she was tachycardic and hypertensive with physical exam notable for scattered ecchymoses of various sizes. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia with hemoglobin of 10.2\u2009g/dl, platelet count of 12,000/L, white blood cell (WBC) count of 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9/L, and absolute neutrophil count of 0.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20133/ml. Fibrinogen and INR were 50\u2009mg/dl and 1.9, respectively. A presumptive diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was suspected based on the presence of increased promyelocytes on bone marrow smear. She was started on all-trans-retinoic acid and her coagulopathy was stabilized with blood products. The diagnosis of APL was confirmed with peripheral blood and bone marrow cytogenetics revealing a t (15;17) translocation.\n\nShe was classified as low/intermediate risk (WBC <\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9/L) and started on ATRA (45\u2009mg/m2/day) and ATO (0.15\u2009mg/kg) for 5 days per week, with differentiation syndrome prophylactic prednisone (0.5\u2009mg/kg daily) [2, 8]. In the early phase of induction therapy, she had intermittent episodes of atypical chest pain and shortness of breath. During these episodes serial troponins were negative and electrocardiograms did not demonstrate ischemic changes. However, on Day 18 of induction therapy, the quality of her symptoms changed, now described as chest pain at rest, waking her from sleep and radiating to the neck lasting several minutes. The pain was worse when supine and relieved by sitting upright. Vital signs and physical exam were within normal limits, cardiovascular exam without murmurs, rubs or signs of volume overload. Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevations and PR segment depressions (Fig.\u00a01) while laboratory studies revealed troponin I elevated to 11\u2009ng/ml (normal range\u2009<\u20090.02) and leucocytosis to 26.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9/L. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated preserved biventricular function, no regional wall motion abnormalities, and minimal pericardial effusion. Her clinical presentation was deemed most consistent with acute myopericarditis given the pleuritic nature of her chest pain, elevated troponin, ECG changes suggestive of acute pericarditis, normal wall motion and minimal pericardial effusion on the echocardiogram. To further evaluate for etiology of myopericarditis, an infectious workup was performed with blood and urine cultures, respiratory viral panel including SARS COVID-2, chest radiograph, all of which returned negative. Given the timing of her symptom onset and the negative work-up to identify another etiology, DS-induced myopericarditis was highly suspected. She remained on prophylactic prednisone through the development of symptoms. Due to the potentially life-threatening nature of DS, ATRA and ATO were held and she was immediately started on high dose steroids (dexamethasone IV 10\u2009mg every 12\u2009h) for the treatment of DS and colchicine 0.6\u2009mg daily for the treatment of pericarditis. To confirm the diagnosis of acute myopericarditis, the patient underwent a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which demonstrated normal biventricular function with no regional wall motion abnormalities, trace pericardial effusion, patchy multifocal sub-epicardial late gadolinium enhancement of the basal anterolateral and mid inferior walls of the left ventricle and elevated T2 signal suggestive of inflammation (Fig.\u00a02). These findings on the cardiac MRI were consistent with the diagnosis of acute myopericarditis. Our patient\u2019s symptoms resolved within 2\u2009days of high dose dexamethasone initiation, the troponin level returned to undetectable levels after 10\u2009days and the WBC count returned to normal range. With troponin, WBC count, ECG, echocardiogram within normal limits, treatment with ATRA and ATO was resumed at a two-dose level reduction using ATO 0.10\u2009mg/kg and ATRA 25\u2009mg/m2 (per the Lo Coco protocol) without complication [2]. Dexamethasone was changed to prednisone 60\u2009mg daily and was the patient was gradually weaned off of it with tapering the dose by 10\u2009mg every week.Fig. 1 A Baseline (pre-treatment) ECG: normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria, QTc 433\u2009ms. B ECG on day +\u200918 of ATRA/ATO regimen: normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, QTc 448\u2009ms, diffuse ST segment elevation, PR depression (arrows)\n\nFig. 2 A Short axis view, basal left ventricle, sub epicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the basal anterolateral wall (arrow). B 2 chamber view, sub epicardial LGE in the mid inferior wall (arrow)\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first case of myopericarditis from differentiation syndrome in a patient treated with ATRA and ATO reported in the literature. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion of DS in patients with APL being treated with ATRA and ATO. It is crucial to be cognizant of the time of onset and various presentations of this syndrome especially in patients on prophylactic steroids due to their anti-inflammatory effect against cytokines released from differentiating myeloid cells leading to a subtle but potentially life-threatening presentation [9].\n\nAlthough the use of ATRA and ATO induction therapy has revolutionized the treatment of APL, a once essentially fatal malignancy, and led to complete remission along with improvement in disease-free and overall survival; differentiation syndrome (DS) is one of the major adverse effects of ATRA therapy and/ or arsenic trioxide therapy [10]. DS is caused by ATRA-induced differentiation of promyelocytes to more mature myeloid forms accompanied by massive cytokine release and a systemic inflammatory response. This potentially fatal syndrome was first documented and described by Frankel et al. in 1992 [9]. The incidence of DS was as high as 26% in patients treated with ATRA monotherapy during the induction phase and symptoms appeared anywhere between 2 and 21\u2009days from starting chemotherapy [9].\n\nDifferentiation syndrome frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians due to the absence of specific diagnostic criteria and its varying manifestations. It is suggested that DS should be considered in patients with APL on ATRA and/or ATO in the presence of two or more of the following signs or symptoms: fever, weight gain, respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusion, hypotension, or renal failure [11].\n\nDyspnoea, fever, pulmonary infiltrates are found in greater than 50% of the reported cases. Our patient developed pleuritic chest pain without other typical signs or symptoms of differentiation syndrome such as fever, hypotension, weight gain, respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions which is potentially attributable to the use of prophylactic steroids [12]. Her presentation was unique in that all prior reports of DS related myopericarditis have been in patients treated with induction regimens consisting of cytotoxic chemotherapy along with ATRA, while she was treated with ATRA and ATO [3\u20137]. There are also a limited number of reported cases of isolated myopericarditis without concomitant pericardial effusions [5\u20137].\n\nGiven the atypical presentation of differentiation syndrome, a multidisciplinary team that included oncologists, cardiologists, pharmacists, cardiac imagers, and multimodality imaging with echocardiogram and cardiac MRI were key to making a timely diagnosis and early initiation of DS directed treatment. It was also important to rule out other potential etiologies for DS such as infection prior to interrupting cancer directed treatment and initiating high dose steroids. Rapid resolution of our patient\u2019s symptoms with initiation of dexamethasone, as well as normalization of ECG and troponin provided further support for the diagnosis of DS-induced myopericarditis.\n\nConclusion\n\nMyopericarditis is a rare manifestation of differentiation syndrome in a patient with APL receiving treatment with ATRA and ATO. Myopericarditis should be included within the spectrum of DS as rapid recognition and treatment is crucial to improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, patients on steroid prophylaxis may present with atypical presentations, and a high index of suspicion must be maintained to allow for early recognition and initiation of life-saving therapy. This rare manifestation of a potentially lethal condition highlights the crucial role of a multidisciplinary care team and the use of multimodality imaging to make the diagnosis.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nATRA All Trans Retinoic Acid\n\nAPL Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia\n\nATO Arsenic Trioxide\n\nDS Differentiation syndrome\n\nECG Electrocardiogram\n\nMRI Magnetic resonance imaging\n\nWBC White blood cell\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nNot applicable.\n\nAuthor\u2019s contributions\n\nShabari Shenoy (SS) performed review of literature and wrote the manuscript.

Here, we report a 40-year-old male kidney transplant recipient who presented with fever, bicytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes 2 months after transplantation. Given that cytomegalovirus antigenemia and real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were positive, liver biopsy was performed under an assumption of cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis. Hepatic histology revealed multifocal microabscess with cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies, marked Kupffer cell hyperplasia, and erythrophagocytosis by activated macrophages. As laboratory findings such as hyperferritinemia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, low natural killer cell activity, and high soluble interleukin-2 receptor were also compatible with HPS, the recipient was diagnosed as having cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis combined with reactive HPS. Following intravenous ganciclovir therapy with continuous administration of tacrolimus and corticosteroid, the symptoms resolved and laboratory findings were normalized. As far as we know, this is the first report of cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis combined with reactive HPS in a kidney transplant recipient that is diagnosed by liver biopsy.\n\nTEXT:\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a clinicopathologic entity characterized by systemic proliferation of macrophages actively phagocytizing other blood cells in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the spleen.12 HPS is caused by impaired function of natural killer and cytotoxic T-cells leading to activation of macrophages.3 Overproduction of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma, are also implicated in the pathogenesis of HPS that some of the symptoms are related to the cytokine overproduction.24 The most common clinical features of HPS include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenia.5 HPS may develop in the context of genetic predisposition, infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disease.6 Most of all, viral infection, especially herpes virus infection, is the most frequent trigger of HPS both in healthy people and immunosuppressed patients.3\n\nCytomegalovirus infection is the single most frequent cause of infectious morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients.78 However, cytomegalovirus-associated HPS has rarely been described in kidney transplant recipients since the first report of reactive HPS in kidney transplant recipient by Risdall, et al.910111213141516 In this rare disease, hepatic dysfunction is often present, but liver biopsy has not been performed on the suspicion of HPS. Here, we report a rare case of cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis combined with reactive HPS in a kidney transplant recipient that was confirmed by hepatic histology.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nA 40-year-old male received deceased donor kidney transplantation 8 years after starting hemodialysis due to IgA nephropathy. The immunosuppression regimen consisted of tacrolimus, corticosteroid, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with induction therapy of basiliximab. Both donor and recipient were positive for IgG and negative for IgM of cytomegalovirus. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course with stable allograft function, and he was discharged on postoperative day 8. The prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus was not performed in the patient. Two months after transplantation, the patient was re-admitted for fever, epigastric discomfort, and mild weight loss. Physical examination was unremarkable with no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The graft function remained stable with a serum creatinine of 1.04 mg/dL. Laboratory findings showed bicytopenia and mild liver enzymes elevation, but no other specific findings were observed.\n\nAt initial assessment, MMF-induced bone marrow suppression was suspected. With discontinuation of MMF and administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor, absolute neutrophil count increased, but low grade fever persisted with continuous elevation of liver enzymes (Table 1). In addition to elevation of liver enzymes, the patient started to develop dyspnea, and computed tomography scan for lung showed bilateral lower lung ground glass opacity (Fig. 1). With an assumption of viral disease, several serological viral tests were performed. Serological studies for Epstein-Barr virus, BK virus, hepatitis A, B, and C, and human immunodeficiency virus were all negative, but active cytomegalovirus infection was confirmed by cytomegalovirus antigenemia and real-time polymerase chain reaction (a viral load of 216879 copies) tests. Under an assumption of cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous gun biopsy of the liver. The liver biopsy showed multifocal microabscess including cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies, marked kupffer cell hyperplasia, and erythrophagocytosis by activated macrophages (Fig. 2), and the patient was diagnosed as having cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis combined with reactive HPS. Additional tests showed hyperferritinemia, low natural killer cell activity, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and high soluble interleukin-2 receptor, supporting our diagnosis of the patient.\n\nOn day 5 of admission, intravenous ganciclovir was started with continuous administration of tacrolimus and corticosteroid. In order to prevent additional bacterial infection and pneumonia aggravation, 4th generation cephalosporin was also started. On day 14 of admission, the patient's complete blood cell count and liver enzyme levels were nearly normalized, and serum ferritin declined to 656.0 \u00b5g/L. Two weeks after starting intravenous ganciclovir, the viral load of cytomegalovirus fell to 2617 copies, reaching below 150 copies by the time of discharge. As his symptoms were resolved and general condition improved, the recipient was discharged on day 26 after hospitalization. The patient was given oral valganciclovir (900 mg once daily) for an additional 3 months, and MMF was restarted 4 weeks after the discharge. As a screening exam for reactivation, cytomegalovirus antigenemia test was performed every 2 weeks for 3 months, and no reactivation occurred during the follow-up period. Informed consent was obtained from the patient regarding the publication of this case report.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHPS is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease in kidney transplant recipients, and it requires early diagnosis and initiation of treatment to improve clinical outcomes. However, its nonspecific clinical presentation makes the diagnosis challenging. In the present case, the patient presented with fever, epigastric discomfort, and mild weight loss. MMF-induced bone marrow suppression was initially suspected, but continuous increase of liver enzymes and positive cytomegalovirus serologic tests led us to perform liver biopsy under an assumption of cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis. However, contrary to our expectation, the hepatic histology revealed marked Kupffer cell hyperplasia and erythrophagocytosis by activated macrophages, suggesting reactive HPS combined with cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis. Subsequently, we conducted additional laboratory exams and were able to diagnosis HPS, as elevated serum ferritin, high soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and low natural killer cell activity were also compatible with HPS.\n\nIn kidney transplant recipients with HPS, liver dysfunction is often present, but liver biopsy has not been performed on the suspicion of HPS, since bone marrow analysis has been known to be the most sensitive diagnostic test for HPS.4 In the present case, however, a liver biopsy was performed instead of a bone marrow biopsy, as the patient's main problem was a continuous elevation of liver enzymes and HPS was not suspected at the time of performing liver biopsy. After the diagnosis of HPS, anti-viral agent was started and the patient's condition improved. Therefore, an additional bone marrow biopsy was not required to confirm HPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cytomegalovirus-associated HPS that is diagnosed by liver biopsy in a kidney transplant recipient.\n\nSince the spectrum of pathogens responsible for HPS is extremely broad, choosing the most adequate antiviral and antibacterial therapy is crucial. However, what to do with the immunosuppressive regimen still remains an unresolved issue.1 Immunosuppressive therapy may help in reducing the activation of macrophages and their cytokine production. On the other hand, the reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy is needed to improve resistance to infection in kidney transplant recipients. According to Karras, et al.,4 who reported the largest series of HPS in kidney transplant recipients, majority of the patients experienced a life-threatening conditions including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurologic disorders, or cardiac failure. In these patients, immunosuppressive agents were tapered, with steroid monotherapy in some patients. In the present case, the patient managed to recover without the discontinuation of tacrolimus and corticosteroid. This suggests that, if the patient's disease severity is not severe, the administration of antiviral therapy with minimal withdrawal of immunosuppressive agent during treatment period would be sufficient to treat the cytomegalovirus-associated HPS in a kidney transplant patient.\n\nHerein, we report a rare case of cytomegalovirus-induced hepatitis combined with reactive HPS that was confirmed by hepatic histology in a kidney transplant recipient. When a kidney transplant recipient presents with fever, cytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, and positive cytomegalovirus serologic tests are confirmed, cytomegalovirus-associated HPS must be always suspected and liver biopsy may be considered for the early diagnosis and successful treatment of HPS.\n\nFig. 1 Computed tomography showing multiple ill-defined tiny nodules, ground glass opacity, peribronchiolar consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs.\n\nFig. 2 Pathology results of liver biopsy.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome-like Condition Associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia During Folinic Acid Treatment in a Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient.\n\nABSTRACT:\nA 94-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis who had been treated with low-dose methotrexate was referred to our hospital because of a 3-day history of a fever and pancytopenia. With a diagnosis of febrile neutropenia of unknown origin, empirical antibiotic treatment and folinic acid therapy were initiated. Despite a recovery from pancytopenia, the high fever remained, and dyspnea developed. She was clinically diagnosed with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and successfully treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and adjunctive corticosteroid therapy. Folinic acid treatment effectively brought about rapid immune recovery but might have led to a clinical manifestation of PCP resembling immune reconstruction inflammatory syndrome.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a severe opportunistic fungal infection in patients with a decline in cell-mediated immunity, known classically as an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining disease (1). The prevalence of PCP in patients infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has dropped due to the spread of highly active antiretroviral therapy and a PCP prophylaxis strategy (2). However, there has been a growing number of PCP patients without HIV infection, due to the increasing use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs (2). The clinical significance and awareness of PCP are thus increasing in the clinical practice of internal medicine.\n\nPCP can manifest after the administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy to HIV patients, a phenomenon thought to be caused by an exaggerated inflammatory response to microorganisms associated with immune recovery (3,4). This phenomenon, known as \u201cimmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS),\u201d has been investigated mainly in the realm of HIV/AIDS, but it has also been reported to occur in non-HIV patients due to steroid tapering or discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatment (5).\n\nWe herein report the case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who presented with an IRIS-like condition associated with PCP during folinic acid treatment for low-dose methotrexate (MTX)-related pancytopenia.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 94-year-old woman who was living in a nursing home was referred to our department with a 3-day history of a fever, cough, and pancytopenia based on laboratory data. She had been diagnosed with RA when she was 60 years old and treated with low-dose MTX (oral 6 mg weekly) for >1 year (exact duration of treatment unknown), without folic acid or prophylactic antimicrobial drugs. One day before coming to our hospital, she was administered levofloxacin by her family physician. She had a fever of 37.7\u00b0C, and the laboratory data revealed pancytopenia (white blood cell count 530 /\u03bcL, hemoglobin 7.6 g/dL, platelet count 3.7\u00d7104/\u03bcL) at that time.\n\nAt presentation, she was emaciated but had few respiratory symptoms. Her vital signs were as follows: body temperature 37.4\u00b0C, blood pressure 157/78 mmHg, heart rate 85 bpm, and percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) 96% on room air. On a physical examination, her wrist joints were highly deformed but neither tender nor swollen. Slight coarse crackles were audible on the lower left lung. Laboratory findings on admission were pancytopenia (white blood cell count 820 /\u03bcL, hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, platelet count 3.1\u00d7104/\u03bcL) and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (17.5 mg/dL) (Table). Chest radiography and chest computed tomography (CT) showed no finding of active inflammation except some old inflammatory changes (Fig. 1a, b). Abdominal CT also showed no findings regarding a source of infection.\n\nTable.

Chest radiograph (c) and chest CT (d) on day 6 post-admission showing bilateral symmetric ground-glass opacities associated with consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions. CT: computed tomography\n\nThe patient was admitted to our hospital and treated with 2 g of cefepime every 12 hours. Since her pancytopenia was suspected of having been caused by the long-term low-dose MTX therapy, we discontinued MTX, administered sufficient intravenous fluids, and initiated a 6-day course of intravenous folinic acid (leucovorin, 18 mg/day). As expected, the patient's blood cell counts began to recover, but her body temperature and CRP level remained high (Fig. 2). A urine culture, a sputum culture, and two sets of blood cultures on admission were all negative.\n\nFigure 2. Clinical course during the initial treatment (from day 0 to day 6). The patient\u2019s body temperature and CRP remained high post-admission despite the blood cell recovery. BT: body temperature, CFPM: cefepime, CRP: C-reactive protein, Lym: lymphocytes, MCFG: micafungin, Neut: neutrophils, WBC: white blood cells\n\nOn day 6 after her admission, the patient's levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (522 U/L) and serum \u03b2-D-glucan (151.9 pg/mL) were elevated. An empirical antifungal therapy (150 mg/day of micafungin) was started. On the same day, the patient developed hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen. Chest X-ray and chest CT revealed bilateral symmetric ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations with bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. 1c, d). Serum KL-6 (615 U/L) levels were also elevated. Based on these findings, we initiated 2.25 g of piperacillin/tazobactam every 6 hours as an escalation of antibiotic therapy, and we consulted the department of respiratory medicine for a diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for suspected PCP.\n\nGiven the patient's age and clinical condition, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was not conducted. On the 8th day of hospitalization, a sputum test was performed for a P. jirovecii-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and we initiated sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMP/SMX) treatment (sulfamethoxazole 1,600 mg/trimethoprim 320 mg/day, intravenous) and corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 80 mg/day, intravenous). The patient's temperature and CRP level began to decrease (Fig. 3). We diagnosed her with PCP based on the positive PCR result, serum \u03b2-D-glucan elevation, and clinical course.\n\nFigure 3. Clinical course after the development of dyspnea (from day 6 to day 29). After the initiation of SMX/TMP treatment and adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, the patient\u2019s clinical condition and radiographic findings gradually improved. MCFG: micafungin, mPSL: methylprednisolone, PSL: prednisolone, SMX/TMP: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, TAZ/PIPC: tazobactam/piperacillin\n\nThe dose of corticosteroid therapy was tapered, and the TMP/SMX treatment was continued for 22 days until the patient's respiratory symptoms and radiography findings improved. The serum \u03b2-D-glucan level transiently increased just after the initiation of the treatment (Fig. 3) but decreased over the course of treatment. The patient was released from the hospital on day 68 of her hospitalization.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe described a case of PCP that became clinically apparent after the introduction of folinic acid treatment for low-dose MTX-induced pancytopenia in a patient with RA. The patient's initial presentation was febrile neutropenia of unknown origin. In addition to empirical antibiotic therapy, we discontinued the patient's MTX regimen and started folinic acid treatment. Despite the recovery of her blood cell counts, the patient developed PCP, but she was successfully treated with SMX/TMP combined with corticosteroid therapy.\n\nOur patient was clinically diagnosed with PCP based on the positive PCR findings, an elevated \u03b2-D-glucan level, and radiologic findings. The diagnosis of PCP is difficult to make because P. jirovecii cannot be cultured. Microscopic staining with BAL fluid, the best diagnostic method for PCP (6), could not be performed in this patient because of her advanced age and clinical condition. Since P. jirovecii-specific PCR has a false-positive issue with colonization, a serum \u03b2-D-glucan assay is regarded as a useful additional tool for diagnosing PCP. The cut-off value for differentiating PCP from colonization was reported to be 33.5 pg/mL, with a positive predictive value was 0.925 (7). In the present case, \u03b2-D glucan was elevated to 495 pg/mL, which exceeded the diagnostic threshold. Serum KL-6 elevation was consistent with the diagnosis of PCP.\n\nChest CT findings on the 6th hospital day showed bilateral diffuse GGOs associated with consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions, both of which are atypical findings in PCP. The combination of GGOs and consolidations can be presented in PCP mainly among non-HIV patients (8). These findings can also be suggestive of heart failure. However, the finding of pleural effusion was considered to reflect hypoalbuminemia and excessive intravenous fluid. In addition, the BNP level (69.1 pg/mL) on the 7th day of hospitalization did not support clinically significant heart failure. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was therefore considered to account for only a small part of the extensive GGOs and consolidations. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia, a frequent opportunistic viral infection in immunocompromised patients, is sometimes difficult to differentiate from PCP on CT (8). However, the result of the CMV pp65 antigenemia assay was negative.\n\nThe lack of significant CT findings on admission might have delayed the diagnosis of PCP. Given that the patient presented to our hospital with a high fever and elevated CRP and LDH levels, she might have already had PCP on admission to our hospital with as-yet-unnoticed radiographical findings. One case report described the absence of GGOs in HIV-related PCP, which caused the authors to mistakenly rule out PCP (9). Another case of PCP with normal chest CT findings was reported in a patient with HIV infection (10). To our knowledge, however, there has been no report of PCP showing no relevant chest CT findings in a non-HIV patient. One possible reason for this is that because PCP in patients without HIV is generally characterized by an acute onset and fast development of disease (6), it is already progressive when CT is performed. The present patient was as severely immunosuppressed as one with AIDS, so the presentation of PCP might have been slowly progressive, like HIV-related PCP, before admission. Since latent PCP without abnormal findings on chest CT can occur under immunosuppressive conditions, such as in cases of AIDS and severe leucopenia, the early recognition of PCP should be based not merely on CT findings but also on the patient's background and serum \u03b2-D glucan values.\n\nThe present case can be regarded as a rare case of PCP presenting with an IRIS-like phenomenon related to leucovorin rescue therapy for MTX-induced pancytopenia. An IRIS-like condition has been reported to occur in non-HIV patients, due typically to steroid withdrawal or the cessation of immunosuppressants (5). In our patient, PCP became clinically apparent after her recovery from leucopenia, resembling unmasking IRIS, which is defined as a clinical manifestation of latent infection (11). This phenomenon can be triggered by reactivation of T-cell mediated immunity due to the discontinuation of MTX therapy and folinic acid treatment. Although not fully understood, T-cell-mediated immunity is believed to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of IRIS (12). Indeed, there is a case report of a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed an IRIS-like syndrome associated with PCP after the completion of alemtuzumab therapy (13). The restoration of the CD4-positive T-lymphocyte count, the value of which was suppressed by alemtuzumab, was speculated to lead to the development of PCP (13).\n\nOur patient was likely to have had long-term myelosuppression due to the low-dose MTX regimen administered prior to her admission. Risk factors for HIV-associated IRIS include a low CD4-positive T lymphocyte count and high pathogen burden at the initiation of anti-HIV therapy (14). The patient exhibited severe leucopenia with lymphocyte counts <200 cells/\u03bcL. Furthermore, the high level of serum \u03b2-D glucan (495 pg/mL) indicated a high burden of P. jirovecii, despite the fact that the fungal load is generally lower in non-HIV patients than in HIV-infected patients (6). In light of the report that a CD4-positive T lymphocyte count <200 cells/\u03bcL is a major risk factor for the development of PCP (15), we suspect that for our patient, the significant deterioration in her immunity, especially T cell-mediated immunity, allowed for the growth of P. jirovecii in her lungs, as seen in HIV-related PCP. We therefore infer that the patient was at a high risk for an IRIS-like syndrome. In this condition, the rapid recovery of white blood cells, including T lymphocytes, due to the cessation of MTX and the folinic acid therapy promoted immune reconstitution, which could have caused an exaggerated inflammatory reaction to P. jirovecii. Therefore, the lung consolidations on chest CT that emerged on the 6th hospital day may have reflected host immune-mediated pulmonary damage in PCP (16).\n\nFolinic acid therapy might have contributed substantially to the rapid recovery of blood cells in the present case. Folinic acid treatment, also known as leucovorin rescue therapy, is mainly used in cases of high-dose MTX-induced hematotoxicity. The Japanese clinical guideline of MTX for RA patients also recommends using it for severe adverse effects of low-dose MTX (17). The recommended daily dose of folinic acid is 3 times as much as the MTX dose, so we administered 18 mg of leucovorin per day (17). Folinic acid treatment was reported to significantly shorten the recovery time from pancytopenia due to low-dose MTX therapy in RA patients (18). This finding suggests that folinic acid therapy might have accelerated the host immune reaction to the pathogen through the mechanism described above.\n\nInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a frequent opportunistic fungal pneumonia associated with serum \u03b2-D glucan elevation in neutropenic patients. We considered it unlikely based on the radiological findings but should have considered performing further examinations, including antigen testing.\n\nIn conclusion, we reported a rare case of an IRIS-like condition associated with PCP in a patient with RA who received folinic acid treatment for low-dose MTX-induced pancytopenia. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of unmasking opportunistic infections after a patient's rapid immune recovery from an immunosuppressive status.\n\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).",

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is suggested to be a rare complication of ESWL since it was reported in several cases to occur after ESWL. However, the clinical and immunological features of the ESWL-associated anti-GBM disease have not been fully investigated so far.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHere, we present the clinical, pathological, and immunological characteristics of three patients with the post-ESWL anti-GBM disease in our hospital. Anti-GBM disease occurred within a median of 22\u2009months after ESWL treatment. It presented with similar clinical features to the classic anti-GBM disease, including fever, gross hematuria, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with poor renal prognosis. Sera from all patients recognized the \u03b13(IV)NC1 in GBM, but with IgG2 and IgG4 as the dominant IgG subclasses.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough further exploration is required to prove the causal relationship in this rare condition, our study reminds physicians that patients developing acute renal insufficiency after ESWL should lead to the suspicion of anti-GBM disease and in-time diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nAnti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease or Goodpasture (GP) disease is a rare but fulminant and fatal disorder. It is widely accepted as a prototypical autoimmune disease induced by autoantibodies targeting the glomerular and alveolar basement membrane [1,2]. The well-defined autoantigen is localized to the non-collagen domain (NC1) of the \u03b13 chain of type IV collagen [\u03b13(IV)NC1] in GBM [3]. In addition, the autoantibodies have been proven to recognize the other 4 \u03b1 chains (\u03b11, 2, 4, and 5) within type IV collagen [4,5]. Two conformational epitopes, EA and EB, were mapped inside \u03b13(IV)NC1 [6] and sequestered within the GBM in healthy individuals [7]. It is still unknown how the immune tolerance would be breached and epitopes exposed. One of the accepted mechanisms is that factors such as smoking [8], hydrocarbon exposure [9], infection [10], or preceding glomerular diseases [11\u201313] would damage the basement membrane and unmask the epitopes [14]. Rare cases have been reported about anti-GBM diseases associated with urinary obstruction [15\u201318] or nephrectomy [19].\n\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a common and noninvasive modality to treat urolithiasis, disintegrating stones by shock waves. Although generally safe [20], it could cause short-term complications as renal colic or obstruction by stone fragments, tissue damage or hematoma, and even temporary reduction of glomerular filtration rate [21]. Renal histopathological findings of human and animal models shortly after ESWL included focal damage to vascular endothelium, nephron, renal tubules, and interstitia [20,22\u201324]. In 1990, Guerin et\u00a0al. first reported a 67-year-old male with rapidly progressive renal disfunction 7\u2009months after ESWL. His serum anti-GBM antibody was positive, while the serum before ESWL was not [25]. Since then, there have been several case reports about the post-ESWL anti-GBM disease, proposing anti-GBM disease as a rare complication of ESWL [26\u201329]. However, the causal relationship between the two has not been elucidated yet, nor the antigen spectrum or IgG subclasses of the autoantibodies in this rare entity.\n\nIn this study, we identified three patients with the post-ESWL anti-GBM disease after retrospectively reviewing 166 consecutive patients diagnosed with the anti-GBM disease in Peking University First Hospital from January 1, 2010 to January 31, 2020. We analyzed their clinical, pathological, and immunological features and reviewed five previously reported cases, aiming to draw a more comprehensive picture and bring insight into possible etiologies of this rare condition.\n\nCase report\n\nCase 1\n\nA 36-year-old male was otherwise healthy except for undergoing one session of ESWL for kidney stones 24\u2009months ago. Kidney function (represented as serum creatinine) was normal. Twenty-four months later, he presented with fever, cough, and hemoptysis for 5\u2009days. He was anemic with hemoglobin 75\u2009g/L and serum creatinine was 691\u2009\u03bcmol/L (eGFR, 8\u2009mL/min/1.73m2). Two days later, he developed gross hematuria and serum creatinine rose to 884\u2009\u03bcmol/L (eGFR, 6\u2009mL/min/1.73m2), at which time he was referred to our hospital. He was a long-term cigarette smoker and had gasoline exposure 15\u2009days ago.\n\nOn admission, he was pale and febrile with no lymphadenopathy. Breath sounds were weak in both lungs on auscultation. Serum creatinine rapidly increased to 1279\u2009\u03bcmol/L (eGFR, 4\u2009mL/min/1.73m2) with oliguria and hemoglobin decreased to 49\u2009g/L. Chest radiography suggested bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage. The circulating anti-GBM antibody was positive, with the titer >200 RU/mL (Euroimmune ELISA kit, normal range <20 RU/mL), while the serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was undetected (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.

The patient was prompted to plasma exchange, intravenous methylprednisolone pulse treatment, cyclophosphamide, and hemodialysis. After 17 sessions of plasma exchange, he became afebrile without hemoptysis. His serum anti-GBM antibody decreased to 33 RU/ml and serum creatine to 425\u2009\u03bcmol/L (eGFR, 14\u2009mL/min/1.73m2). Repeated chest radiography indicated the absorption of his hemorrhage. He was dialysis-independent on discharge and a 3-month follow-up.\n\nSera from this patient were tested for antigen spectrum using recombinant human \u03b11\u20135(IV)NC1 chains and chimeric proteins containing epitopes EA and EB on \u03b13(IV)NC1 (Supplementary materials and methods). The patient's serum recognized \u03b11 and \u03b13(IV)NC1 domains, and both epitopes EA and EB of \u03b13(IV)NC1. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass distribution against \u03b13(IV)NC1 was also tested for the sera. All 4 subclasses of IgG were detected, with the dominance of IgG2 and IgG4 (Table 1; Figure S1).\n\nFigure 1. Renal pathology of patient 3 with post-extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) anti-GBM disease showed cellular crescent formation in a glomerulus by periodic acid-silver methenamine and Masson trichrome stain on light microscopy (400\u00d7).\n\nCase 2\n\nA 50-year-old male undertook one session of ESWL for ureter stones with normal kidney function 22\u2009months ago. He was a 20-year cigarette smoker but had quit smoking for 10\u2009years. Twenty-two months later he was referred to our hospital for fever, gross hematuria, and rapidly progressive renal dysfunction. He had suffered from intermittent fever for 2\u2009months without other indicating symptoms and it could not be resolved by antibiotics. Fifteen days prior to admission, he developed gross hematuria and the serum creatinine progressed from 160\u2009\u03bcmol/L (eGFR, 40\u2009mL/min/1.73m2) to 504\u2009\u03bcmol/L (eGFR, 11\u2009mL/min/1.73m2). No stones were found by renal ultrasound.\n\nAfter admission, he was diagnosed with anti-GBM disease due to positive serum anti-GBM antibody (183 RU/mL). His serum ANCA was tested negative. He received 7 sessions of plasma exchange, intravenous methylprednisolone pulse treatment, and hemodialysis. His condition improved and hematuria disappeared afterward. Serum creatinine decreased to 353\u2009\u03bcmol/L (eGFR, 16\u2009mL/min/1.73m2) and anti-GBM antibody titer to 51 RU/mL on discharge. The patient was dialysis-dependent during a 60-month follow-up (Table 1).\n\nThe patient's sera reacted with all five \u03b1 chains and both EA and EB epitopes of \u03b13(IV)NC1. All 4 IgG subclasses to \u03b13(IV)NC1 were detected with the dominance of IgG2 (Table 1; Figure S1).\n\nCase 3\n\nA 74-year-old female received one session of ESWL for kidney stones 10\u2009months ago when the renal function was normal. Ten months after ESWL, she complained of fever and gross hematuria with urinary irritation symptoms for 2\u2009weeks. No leukocytosis was found, but her urinalysis revealed white and red blood cells. Initial workups showed elevated C-reactive protein (96\u2009mg/L) and normal serum creatinine (87\u2009\u03bcmol/L; eGFR, 55\u2009mL/min/1.73m2). Renal ultrasound showed no stones. She was diagnosed with urinary tract infection and treated by intravenous antibiotics, after which she reported no symptom improvement but developed oliguria and bilateral edema of lower extremities. Her serum creatinine deteriorated to 1066\u2009\u03bcmol/L (eGFR, 3\u2009mL/min/1.73m2) within 9\u2009days. Then she was referred to our hospital.\n\nOn admission, physical examination revealed a sick and pale woman with no rales on auscultation. Serum anti-GBM antibody was positive (196 RU/mL) while the serum ANCA was not. Renal biopsy revealed severe necrosis of glomerular capillary walls and cellular/cellular-fibrous crescents in all 32 glomeruli on light microscopy (Figure 1), with no electron-dense deposits on electron microscopy. The immunofluorescence microscopy was negative on a sclerotic glomerulus. She was treated by methylprednisolone pulse and cyclophosphamide. Plasma exchange was not performed, given the poor prognosis based on renal biopsy. Her renal function did not recover and she remained dialysis-dependent. The patient died of esophagus cancer 2\u2009years after discharge.\n\nThe patient's sera recognized all five \u03b1 chains and both EA and EB epitopes of \u03b13(IV)NC1. As for circulating IgG to \u03b13(IV)NC1, all four subclasses were detected with the dominance of IgG2 (Table 1; Figure S1).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we described three patients with anti-GBM disease occurring within 2\u2009years after ESWL. The incidence of such cases among all anti-GBM patients from our hospital in the past 10\u2009years was 1.81% (3/166). Their clinical manifestations, pathological features, and antigen spectrum were similar to the classic anti-GBM disease. All three patients presented with fever, gross hematuria, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with poor renal prognosis. One of them suffered from pulmonary hemorrhage. The one available renal biopsy revealed 100% crescent formation in the glomeruli. All three patients recognized a3(IV)NC1 and EA/EB epitopes. None were positive for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA).\n\nPost-ESWL anti-GBM disease has been rarely reported. After searching in PubMed using keywords \u2018anti-GBM\u2019, \u2018Goodpasture\u2019, \u2018ESWL\u2019, and \u2018lithotripsy\u2019, we found five previous cases of the post-ESWL anti-GBM disease with full text in English, reviewed in Table 2. Among the five patients, three of them were male and two were female, with a median age of 67\u2009years old (range, 32\u201372\u2009years). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) phenotyping was performed in all five patients, with four of them expressing susceptible serotypes for anti-GBM disease [30]. All previous cases presented with shorter ESWL-to-onset intervals (1\u2009week to 7\u2009months) than ours, possibly due to more ESWL treatment numbers. Renal damage by ESWL appears to be cumulative in animal experiments and human, proportional to the application frequency and the number of treatments [31\u201333]. Their clinical manifestations, renal pathologies, and prognosis were similar to ours. Specifically, fever occurred in all previous reports and ours. However, only a few of them (3/8, 37.5%) were reported to bear prodromal infections and none in either group were positive for ANCA. Fever was a common feature in anti-GBM disease patients, as shown in our previous study in a 140-patient cohort, and 78.7% of febrile patients had infections [34]. The infection rate in post-ESWL anti-GBM disease patients seemed to be lower, which might indicate distinct disease triggers other than prodromal infections in these patients.\n\nTable 2.

However, there has been evidence about the collagen cleaving effect of ultrasound since early 1980s when researchers tried to isolate and define the components of GBM by physical methods. Glomeruli were sequestered and sonicated to separate the GBM, which then released split products of collagen with antigenicity [35], indicating ultrasound could cause local damage of the GBM. There was also evidence of transient nephrotic-range proteinuria immediately after ESWL in a patient cohort [36] and mesangial proliferative glomerulopathy after ESWL in experimental animal models of pig [37]. Moreover, shock wave lithotripsy is utilized in pancreatic and large common bile duct stones or sialolithiasis, but no cases of anti-GBM disease have been reported in either of these conditions yet, suggesting ESWL for urinary stones may affect kidneys more directly. Therefore, ESWL could possibly damage and expose the antigen inside the GBM via direct damage by shock waves or secondary damage by immune-complex induced by ESWL debris [37].\n\nAnti-GBM IgG subclass distribution is associated with disease severity [38]. The IgG1 and IgG3 dominated the IgG subclasses in patients with severe renal impairment, while IgG2 and IgG4 were associated with milder renal damage [38]. In post-ESWL anti-GBM disease patients from this study, the IgG2 and IgG4 were the dominant subclasses against \u03b13(IV)NC1. However, these patients presented with severe renal damage and poor prognosis. The IgG subclass switching after B cell activation follows the sequence of IgG3\u2192IgG1\u2192IgG2\u2192IgG4. It has been suggested that IgG4 production results from chronic or repetitive antigenic stimulation [39,40]. Moreover, low-level natural anti-GBM autoantibodies existed in healthy human sera, predominantly of IgG2 and IgG4 [41]. We speculated that ESWL might expose GBM autoantigens and induce IgG autoantibodies chronically during the ESWL-to-onset interval, allowing them to complete subclass switching. The autoantibodies may accumulate beyond a threshold to disturb the immune tolerance in healthy individuals and provoke the pathogenic autoimmunity.\n\nAnti-GBM diseases were also reported scarcely to associate with obstructive uropathy due to urinary malignancy, neurogenic bladder, or ureteral stenosis [15\u201318]. The anti-GBM antibody level and renal function seemed to be parallel with treatment efficacy of hydronephrosis [18]. Intact NC1 hexamer could be detected in the serum and be secreted in the urine of healthy individuals [17,42]. Rabbits immunized with their own urinary concentrate developed anti-GBM glomerulonephritis [43]. It was suggested that urinary \u03b13(IV)NC1 under urinary obstruction might enter the renal interstitia, dissociate under acidic pH changed by inflammatory infiltrate (such as infection) and act as an immunogen [17]. These studies provide another theory for the induction of anti-GBM disease associated with urinary stones, including patients treated by ESWL.\n\nThe limitations of our study lay in at least two points. Firstly, the number of cases is too small to draw the causal relationship between ESWL and anti-GBM disease. Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that individuals with anti-GBM disease or with susceptible HLA phenotypes may bear a higher risk of urinary obstructions, which lead to the production of anti-GBM antibodies. A prospective cohort study in patients undergoing ESWL might be required to further elucidate the relationship between the procedure and anti-GBM disease. Secondly, not all patients had detailed ESWL information (stone component, shock wave frequency, and energy), kidney biopsy, and HLA phenotypes for us to draw a full picture.\n\nIn summary, the anti-GBM disease could happen within weeks to months after ESWL treatment and present with similar clinical features, antigen spectrum, and prognosis to classic anti-GBM disease. IgG2 and IgG4 were the two dominant subclasses against \u03b13(IV)NC1. Although the causal relationship between ESWL and anti-GBM disease still needs further exploration, our study here may act as a reminder for physicians that patients developing acute renal insufficiency after ESWL should lead to the suspicion of anti-GBM disease and in-time diagnosis and treatment.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nGeolocation information\n\nCity: Beijing, Latitude: 39.9289, Longitude: 116.3883.\n\nEthical policy and institutional review board statement\n\nWritten informed consents were obtained from the patients for publication of the three cases and any accompanying images.

The quality of life in patients with STAT3-HIES is determined by not only the progressive, life-limiting pulmonary disease, but also significant skin disease including recurrent infections and abscesses requiring surgery. Our early report indicated that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might not be effective in patients with STAT3-HIES, although a few subsequent reports have reported successful outcomes. We update on progress of our patient now with over 18 years of follow-up and report on an additional seven cases, all of whom have survived despite demonstrating significant disease-related pathology prior to transplant. We conclude that effective cure of the immunological aspects of the disease and stabilization of even severe lung involvement may be achieved by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recurrent skin infections and abscesses may be abolished. Donor TH17 cells may produce comparable levels of IL17A to healthy controls. The future challenge will be to determine which patients should best be offered this treatment and at what point in their disease history.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nAutosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome is a rare primary immunodeficiency (PID) with multisystem pathology [1], caused by dominant-negative loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) [2, 3] (STAT3-HIES). STAT3 is integral to lymphocyte development and differentiation. STAT3-deficient humans and mice have impaired cellular and humoral immune responses [4, 5], explaining the diverse immunologic manifestations [2\u20134]. In the context of infection, there is poor differentiation of T lymphocytes into TH17 cells, resulting in low IL17 and IL22 production [6], which contributes to susceptibility to encapsulated organisms and fungi.\n\nHSCT was initially reported as unsuccessful in STAT3-HIES by our group [7]. Based on this impression, supportive treatment has been largely adopted [1], but many patients develop severe life-limiting pulmonary disease. However, over the years, eight case reports of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for STAT3-HIES have been published [7\u201312], three of them performed following the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s B cell lymphoma, which is a known complication of this primary immunodeficiency [8]. In these eight cases, five patients had received myeloablative conditioning regimens, while three had reduced-intensity conditioning. Seven patients, including two with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, were recently reported as alive and well 4\u201320 years following report of HSCT [13], while one patient had died from the pre-existing lymphoma post-transplant [10].\n\nWe initially reported failure of HSCT to resolve or cure the immune defect in our first patient. However, we now acknowledge that STAT3-HIES patients have experienced sustained benefit from HSCT. At the time of our report, the molecular cause of STAT3-HIES was unknown, and we based our statements on failure to normalize the serum IgE level and an apparent failure to change the immunological defect. We have now shown that the IL17A levels of that patient approaches normal (although not measured pre-transplant) and memory B-lymphocytes are present. We now report a series of eight patients successfully treated with HSCT in the UK, including the long-term follow up of our previously reported patient [7].\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a retrospective review of medical records of STAT3-HIES patients from two UK transplant centers for PID. We included only patients with confirmed dominant-negative STAT3 mutations who have undergone allogeneic HSCT. We recorded pre-transplant co-morbidities, conditioning, outcome, and on-going co-morbidities in eight patients who received nine transplants.\n\nIn selected patients for whom samples were available, IL17A levels were measured by Luminex (Bio-Plex, Biorad, UK) [14], 24 hours after stimulation in whole blood (96 Costar-F plates, 1:5 diluted in RPMI) of healthy controls and patients. Stimulations were performed using PHA (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 \u03bcg/ml) and compared with unstimulated medium samples. Data were compared with historic controls, which had been stimulated under identical conditions. P values were calculated using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test or the Wilcoxon matched pairs test, excluding the data of P5 before HSCT.\n\nParents, and, where appropriate, patients consented to the procedure and data collection.\n\nResults\n\nTransplants were performed between 1996 and 2019. Demographic data, genetic mutation, and pre-HSCT clinical status are summarized in Table 1. All patients had dominant loss-of-function mutations in STAT3 with a classical clinical phenotype, and all had significant lung or skin-related complications prior to HSCT.Table 1 Patient demographic features and pre- and post-HSCT clinical details\n\nPatient no.; sex\tAge at HSCT (years)\tSTAT3 Heterozygous mutation\tSkin disease\tLung disease and PFTs\tFractures; other skeletal disease\tInfection; other Issues\t\nPre-HSCT\tPost-HSCT\tPre-HSCT\tPost-HSCT\tPre-HSCT\tPost-HSCT\tPre-HSCT\tPost-HSCT\t\n1\n\nM\n\n\t7\tc.1909 G>A p.V637M\tYes\tNormal\tLeft upper and lower lobectomies with bronchopleural fistula; bilateral bronchiectasis; chronic Aspergillus infection; pulmonary hypertension\n\nFEV1 47%\n\nFVC 51%\n\n\tStable appearance on CT: bronchiectasis persist\n\nNocturnal CPAP for lobar collapse post-scoliosis repair with limited exercise tolerance\n\nFEV1 20%\n\nFVC 23%\n\n\tYes\t2 further fractures at 3\u20134 years post-HSCT\n\nDevelopment of scoliosis requiring spinal fusion\n\n\tStaphylococcus aureus pericarditis\t-\t\n2\n\nF\n\n\t6\tc.1771 A>G p.K591E\tYes\tNormal\tRecurrent Pseudomonas lung infection with cyst formation\n\nNot done\n\n\tStable; no progression of pulmonary cysts\n\nFEV1 95%\n\nFVC 88%\n\n\tNo\tDevelopment of scoliosis\t-\tGonadal failure following myeloablative conditioning\n\nArterial hypertension\n\n\t\n3\n\nM\n\n\t13\tc.1144 C>T p.R382W\tYes\tNormal\tSevere and recurrent pneumonia with bronchiectasis\n\nFEV1 63%\n\nFVC 70%\n\n\tStable appearance on CT\n\nNo further hemoptysis\n\nFEV1 83%\n\nFVC 71%\n\n\tYes\tNo\t-\tST segment elevation myocardial infarction aged 26 years (13 years post-HSCT)\t\n4\n\nM\n\n\t14\tc.1144 C>T p.R382W\tYes\n\nPustular dermatitis\n\n\tDry skin, no infection\tBronchiectasis with multi-cystic lung disease, leading to left lobectomy\n\nFEV1 28%\n\nFVC 26%\n\n\tSignificant improvement in pulmonary cystic disease and resolution in right lower lobe bronchial thickening on CT\n\nFEV1 65%\n\nFVC 74%\n\n\tYes\tNo\tStaphylococcus aureus liver abscess\tAutoimmune neutropenia\t\n5\n\nF\n\n\t17\tc.1144 C>T p.R382W\tYes\n\nPersistent infected czema\n\n\tNormal\tPneumatocoele leading to left lobectomy\n\nFEV1 53%\n\nFVC 67%\n\n\tImprovement in lung appearance on CT\n\nFEV1 51%\n\nFVC 67%\n\n\tYes\tNo\t-\tAspergillus perdicarditis at 7 months post-HSCT resolved by 16 months post-HSCT\t\n6\n\nM\n\n\t18\tc.1110 A>G D371_G380del\tYes\n\nEczema, pustular dermatitis\n\n\tResolution of previous chronic infection\tLung abscess; pulmonary TB\n\nFEV1 89%\n\nFVC 90%\n\n\tStable CXR changes\n\nNot done\n\n\tNo\n\nRetained primary dentition\n\n\tEnterococcal septic arthritis with collapse of femoral head\tRecurrent Staphylococcus aureus liver abscess\n\nCandida retroperitoneal lymphadenitis and liver abscess\n\n\tEarly gastrointestinal bleed in post-transplant period\n\nMedication-related nephrotoxicity\n\n\t\n6\n\n2nd HSCT\n\n\t18\t\n7\n\nM\n\n\t13\tc.1144 C>G p.R382G\tYes\n\nMultiple skin abscesses\n\n\tDry skin, no infection\tMinimal\n\nFEV1 89%\n\nFVC 90%\n\n\tImprovement in symptoms and exercise tolerance\n\nNot done\n\n\tNo\n\nRetained primary dentition\n\n\tNo\tOsteomyelitis of mandible\t-\t\n8\n\nF\n\n\t6\tc.1144 C>T p.R382W\tYes\n\nEczema, Multiple skin abscesses\n\n\tDry skin, no infection\tSevere bronchiectasis bilaterally with broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis\n\nFEV1 84%\n\nFVC 92%\n\n\tImprovement in symptoms\n\nFEV1 82.7%FVC 78.4%\n\n\tNo\tNo\t-\t-\t\n\nDetails of conditioning regimen, cell source, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis are detailed in Table 2.

Seven patients had complete or high level (>90%) donor chimerism and one had partial chimerism; however, all had improvement in immune phenotype, with a reduction in clinical symptoms, halting of progression of lung disease and improvement in skin infections. Non-immune manifestations showed variable improvement, with one patient developing further fractures and two patients demonstrating worsening scoliosis post-transplant. One patient has recently had vasculopathy with an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction with ectatic coronary vasculature [12].

For patients 2, 3, and 4, IL17A levels were present post-transplant, but lower than controls (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 IL17A levels in healthy controls and patients post-transplant. IL17A levels were measured by Luminex (Bio-Plex, Biorad, UK) 24 hours after stimulation in whole blood (96 Costar-F plates, 1:5 diluted in RPMI) of healthy controls (historical and contemporary) and patients (P2\u2014blue diamonds, P3\u2014blue triangles, P4\u2014blue squares, P5 (pre and post HSCT) \u2014blue circles). Stimulations were done using PHA (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 \u03bcg/ml) and compared with unstimulated medium samples (Med)\n\nPatient 1 had significant pulmonary infection (complicated cystic bronchiectasis with Pseudomonas infection and widespread Aspergillus infection leading to pulmonary hypertension) with two lobectomies, complicated by development of bronchopleural fistula. He subsequently developed a Staphylococcus aureus pericarditis requiring surgical drainage, complicated by prolonged air leak. Transplantation at age 7 years was relatively uncomplicated. There was no viral re-activation, progression of chest lesions, or acute graft versus host disease. Six years post-transplant, his eczema had resolved and he was no longer getting significant respiratory infections. Immunoglobulin support has ceased, and normal vaccine and T-lymphocyte proliferative responses have been demonstrated. His scoliosis, exacerbated by his two previous left sided lobectomies, had deteriorated requiring spinal fusion surgery. Following this, his right lower airway integrity has been compromised, severely impairing his respiratory capacity. He now is reliant on overnight CPAP and can only ambulate short distances.\n\nPatient 2 experienced frequent staphylococcal skin infections and cystic bronchiectasis infected with Pseudomonas, because of which transplantation was offered when aged 6 years. Despite 100% donor chimerism, the procedure was initially described as unsuccessful [7] because of continued elevated serum IgE. However, long-term follow-up confirmed sustained clinical improvement with no further respiratory or skin infections. Serum IgE levels diminished and remained reduced, and immunoglobulin support is no longer required. She developed thoracolumbar scoliosis, arterial hypertension, and gonadal failure. With 20 years follow-up, pulmonary status includes stable lingular bronchiectasis and non-progressive right upper lobe pulmonary cysts.\n\nPatient 3 experienced frequent severe bronchopneumonias and progressive bronchiectasis despite immunoglobulin replacement, as well as osteopenia and lumbar vertebrae compression fractures. Transplantation at 13 years was relatively uneventful, and 13 years post-transplant, he demonstrates 100% donor chimerism with reduced serum IgE levels. Lung function has improved to normal values. Hemoptysis has stopped, and there is no computerized tomographic evidence of pulmonary disease progression. An increase in IL17A production after polyclonal stimulation was demonstrated post-HSCT (Fig. 2), and TH17 cells display normal response to IFN-\u03b3 and IL12 and normal IL12 production (data not shown). However, at 11 years post-HSCT, he sustained an anterior myocardial infarction, accompanied by classical clinical, electrocardiographic and biochemical signs and parameters. Angiography revealed proximal ectasia causing mid-vessel occlusion of his left anterior descending coronary artery but otherwise unobstructed coronary vessels. He was commenced on aspirin 75 mg for 3 months with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID for 3 years and clopidogrel 75 mg long term [12].Fig. 2 Pre- and post-transplant peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrate that IL17A is absent pre-transplant and present post-transplant (patient 3), with normal control and a negative control patient who has not been transplanted (p.V637M)\n\nPatient 4 developed bronchiectasis, Staphylococcus aureus liver abscess, and recurrent skin abscesses. Severe multi-cystic and suppurative lung disease warranted left upper lobectomy. Following transplantation at age 14 years, repeat computerized tomography demonstrated significant widespread decrease in the number and size of previously reported large cysts, and there was a clinical improvement in the eczematous skin lesions. Post-transplant IL17A production was normal.\n\nPatient 5 developed multiple abscesses and pneumatoceles during infancy leading to right upper lobectomy and broncho-pulmonary fistula at age 13 years. Pulmonary function was impaired prior to HSCT, aged 17 years. Non-invasive pulmonary Aspergillus infection persisted post-HSCT, treated with appropriate long-term anti-fungal therapy\u2014at 7 months post-transplant, and Aspergillus pericarditis was diagnosed, which resolved with dual anti-fungal therapy by 16 months post-transplant. Thoracic computerized tomography demonstrated a dramatic improvement in lung appearance, and the residual right upper lobe cavity remained stable.\n\nPatient 6 had persistent multiple skin infections with severe eczema and lymphadenitis through childhood and a single lung abscess. Additionally, a persistent Staphylococcus aureus hepatic abscess required surgical drainage on four occasions. Further to this, the patient required surgical excision of Candida albicans retroperitoneal lymphadenitis and a fungal liver abscess. The patient developed bowel perforation of unknown etiology at 6 years of age, before HSCT. An immune-mediated acute rejection of first graft was confirmed at day 13 post-transplant, followed by an autologous recovery. In this period, the patient experienced an enterococcal septic arthritis, with collapse of femoral head, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and further episodes of fungal lymphadenitis. A second transplant procedure using a reduced toxicity treosulfan-based regimen was successful. The patient has good immune reconstitution and has ceased immunosuppression and immunoglobulin replacement.\n\nPatient 7 was first referred to pediatric care at the age of 4 weeks due of eczema and skin infections, mainly on the face and scalp, from which Staphylococcus aureus was isolated and treated. Serum IgE levels were elevated prompting a diagnosis of Hyper IgE syndrome, confirmed genetically. The patient continued to have numerous recurrent skin abscesses, requiring drainage over 20 times per year despite antibiotic treatment and immunoglobulin replacement. He subsequently developed mandibular osteomyelitis. Pulmonary disease was limited to asthma only, with no significant infection. Transplant was uncomplicated, and at 20 months post-HSCT, his skin is much improved with no new infections. He has discontinued immunoglobulin and is awaiting vaccination.\n\nPatient 8 presented as a neonate with staphylococcal skin infection and went on to develop recurrent skin infection, pneumonia, and otitis media. She demonstrated elevated serum IgE with poor pneumococcal antibody titers following vaccination and almost no TH17 cells. Her pulmonary disease progressed with findings of Aspergillus on bronchoalveolar lavage leading to a diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, treated with antifungal therapy, corticosteroids, and anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies. She underwent HSCT aged 6 years with an uncomplicated course. One year post-HSCT, she reports only dry skin with no infection. Pulmonary function is stable and she is asymptomatic from cough or dyspnoea. Serum IgE has fallen to 392 kU/L. She remains on immunoglobulin replacement but has normal B lymphocyte numbers.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPublished data on the outcome of allogeneic HSCT for STAT3-HIES patients are limited, perhaps stemming from our initial report indicating non-utility [7]. A recent report by Oikonomopoulou et al. [13] summarizes the data of 7 patients transplanted between 1998 and 2018, one of which was the patient we originally reported in 2000 [7]. For three of these, the transplant indication was lymphoma [9, 10], and thus, although the STAT3-HIES was reported as cured, their transplant indication and management could be considered separately. The first of these patients died 6 months following transplant from interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, although with pre-existing abnormal immune parameters, including raised IgE, normalized post-transplant [10]. The other two patients, with follow up of 10 and 14 years, respectively, both with 100% donor chimerism, were reported to have normalized immunological parameters including a normalized proportion of TH17+ lymphocytes. Furthermore, other abnormalities associated with STAT3-HIES, including coarse facies and osteoporosis, were reported to have resolved, and there was no symptomatic development of STAT3-HIES-associated vasculopathy, although it is not clear if any screening was performed [9]. A further patient, transplanted because of a complicated infectious history, was reported after 42 months of follow-up. The patient had full donor chimerism and remained infection-free after discontinuing anti-microbial prophylaxis. Vaccine antibody responses were demonstrated and IgE normalized, STAT3 signaling was restored in hematopoietic-derived cells, and the percentage of Th17+ lymphocytes and central memory T lymphocytes to normal ranges was established [11]. Finally, 2 patients, transplanted for recurrent infection, were reported with 8 and 10 years of follow-up, respectively. Immunological parameters normalized and the infection frequency significantly diminished, but non-immunological features of STAT3-HIES remained, including a propensity to recurrent fractures and development of a new pneumatocele, associated with \u226450% donor chimerism [8].\n\nOur current report extends follow-up of the initial patient to over 18 years and reports on a further 7 patients, one recently published in the context of new onset vasculopathy complications [12], thus contributing the largest series to date. Perhaps the most remarkable observation is that despite pre-transplant severe, progressive lung disease\u2014itself a significant risk factor for HSCT outcome\u2014as well as other significant pre-transplant sequelae, all patients in our series survived. Importantly, pulmonary disease has stabilized in all and improved in some, as demonstrated on clinical, functional, and radiological parameters (Table 1; Fig. 3). No peri-transplant pulmonary inflammatory complications were observed, unlike the post-HSCT course seen in many PID patients. GvHD was infrequent and insignificant. Notably, no patients have required further lung surgery post-HSCT. Most patients have remained on some antimicrobial prophylaxis, in view of treating physician concerns of recurrent infections in pre-existing bronchiectatic lungs\u2014despite this, control of lung disease reported by patients has stabilized or improved. Aspergillus infection, likely from pre-existing colonization or infection, recurred through, or after transplantation in some, but did not cause the severe complications usually associated with transplant-associated aspergillosis. Other significant infections reduced in frequency or resolved completely, accepting that most patients remained on antimicrobial prophylaxis. Importantly, eczema improved in all patients and skin infections were abolished post-transplant.Fig. 3 Thoracic computerized tomography images from patient 4. a Images taken 1 year pre-transplant showing markedly abnormal lung parenchyma with large cysts, bullae, and cystic bronchiectasis particularly in the right lower lobe in association with cylindrical bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, bronchocoeles, and reduced lung attenuation. b Images taken 1 year post-transplant showing several thin walled pulmonary \u201ccysts,\u201d similar to previous pre-transplant findings and are therefore most likely to result from previous infection and lung destruction. Some regions of parenchymal distortion and scarring are also similar. There is some bronchial dilatation and distortion in regions of scarring, but no convincing evidence of bronchiectasis\n\nSTAT3 plays an important part in normal endothelial cell biology [16], and endothelial dysfunction is known to contribute to initiation of transplant-related inflammatory complications [17]. It may be that the lack of severe post-HSCT inflammatory complications including acute graft-versus-host disease, observed in these patients and the previously reported cases, might be due to reduced endothelial cell upregulation, conferred by dominant negative STAT3-LOF mutations.\n\nAlthough serum IgE levels remain above the adult reference range, they are substantially lower post-HSCT compared with pre-HSCT levels, although, in non-transplanted patients, IgE levels may fall over time [1]. More importantly, in those patients for whom data were available, normal TH17 function and associated cytokine responses are demonstrated (Fig. 1), confirming previous reports [8, 9, 11].\n\nAs expected, many extra-immune manifestations have not resolved post-HSCT, and patients retain coarse facial features, as well as bone-related complications, although it is noteworthy that only one patient has developed fractures post-transplantation. No patient has developed lymphoma to date. Critically, however, one patient (#3) recently experienced an anterior myocardial infarction, with evidence of thrombotic occlusion of dilated (ectatic) coronary vessels upon angiography. We estimated this patient\u2019s 10-year risk of developing a heart attack or stroke, using the QRISK3 calculator, as 0.1%, which suggests that conventional cardiovascular risk factors were unlikely to account for the event, and disease-associated vasculopathy is more likely to be implicated [12]. Screening of coronary vasculature had not been performed prior to this event, and so it is unclear whether HSCT ameliorated, accelerated, or had no effect on these coronary vessels. Whether earlier HSCT will favorably alter the pre-disposition to vascular complications documented in these patients remains to be seen. Further research is required to establish the clinical significance of these wider complications of STAT3-HIES and capture the long-term impact of STAT3-HIES on patients\u2019 quality of life across the spectrum of presentations.\n\nContrary to our previous assertion [7], this series, along with other published reports, further supports the notion that allogeneic HSCT can improve the immunological deficit, modify the pulmonary course in these patients, and improve the skin condition. The future challenge will be to identify which patients will benefit from early consideration of this therapy to prevent end-organ damage, reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life, as well as which conditioning regimen to use. The importance of complete or high donor chimerism is not established, and further work is required to determine optimum conditioning regimens and minimum effective donor chimerism level. Furthermore, it will be particularly important to determine whether HSCT can alter the risk of developing vascular anomalies, which may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nAuthor Contribution\n\nARG conceived the study.

This current case report describes a 60-year-old male patient that presented with numbness of the left lower extremity and worsening headache. After a full range of investigations and a partial resection of the right cerebellum, external ventricular drainage reservoir placement and cranioplasty, he was diagnosed with primary CNS-HL. The patient was treated with 3 g/m2 methotrexate (intravenous [i.v.], once a day, day 1) and 1 g/m2 cytarabine (i.v., every 12 h, days 2\u2009+\u20093), followed by anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibodies (200 mg sintilimab, i.v., once a day, day 1, every 3 weeks). After six courses of treatment with intrathecal injections of 50 mg cytarabine (once a day, day 1) and 5 mg dexamethasone (once a day, day 1), there was no residual lesion on cranial magnetic resonance imaging.

The patient has been followed up every 3 months and no relapse has occurred.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nPrimary central nervous system Hodgkin's lymphoma (CNS-HL) is rare, with only two of 14\u00a0868 cases with CNS involvement reported in the recent literature.1 The incidence of CNS involvement was as low as 0.02%.2,3 Primary CNS-HL is extremely rare and only 22 cases have been reported in the literature.4 To date, the longest survival time reported was 9 years.5 There is no consensus on diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of primary CNS-HL because the incidence is so low that large-scale clinical trials cannot be carried out.\n\nCase report\n\nIn February 2015, a 60-year-old male developed symptoms of a headache and presented to the Department of Neurosurgery, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China. Head computed tomography (CT) imaging showed obstructive hydrocephalus of unknown cause. Prior to the headache, the patient had no history of other diseases. His symptoms improved after he received mannitol (125 ml intravenous [i.v.], every 12 h, days 1\u20137) treatment to reduce the intracranial pressure. Subsequently, the patient continued to experience occasional painful headaches, but he did not seek further medical advice for a diagnosis. In October 2018, the patient presented to the Department of Neurosurgery, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital with numbness of the left lower extremity and worsening headache. Head CT imaging revealed an abnormal density shadow with supratentorial ventricular dilatation hydrops in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple nodules, masses and abnormal signals of Gyri in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, bilateral cerebellar oedema and hydrocephalus (Figure 1). Partial resection of the right cerebellum, external ventricular drainage reservoir placement and cranioplasty were performed. Pathological examination of the right cerebellar mass showed that there was lymphocyte infiltration and multiple foci of necrosis (Figure 2). There were large cells with small lymphocytes around and some of the cells had binucleate nucleoli. Reed\u2013Sternberg (RS) cells were detected. Based on immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and T cell receptor gene rearrangement findings, the diagnosis of CNS-HL was made. The HL was mixed cellularity HL (MCHL) with a lot of monoclonal T cell infiltration. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the large cells were stained as follows: CD30+, cyclinD1+, MUM-1+, Pax5\u00b1, CD15\u00b1, Bob-1\u00b1, KI67+ (40%), CD20\u2013, CD21\u2013, CD10\u2013, Oct-2\u2013 and ALK\u2013. Small lymphoma cells were stained as follows: CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD43+, BCL-2+, TIA-1+, CD7\u00b1, BCL-6\u00b1, KI67+ (20\u201330%), CD20\u2013, CD21\u2013, CD56\u2013, CD10\u2013, GRB\u2013, perforin\u2013, TDT\u2013, MPO\u2013 and SOX11\u2013. The rate of positive immunostaining of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was 15%. The peripheral blood Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-DNA level was 1.26 x 104 copies/ml. EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) staining was positive. The karyotype was 46,XY. No gene mutations were found for lymphoma hotspot genes by next generation sequencing.\n\nFigure 1. Magnetic resonance imaging of a 60-year-old male patient that presented with numbness of the left lower extremity and worsening headache revealed the following: multiple nodules, masses and abnormal signals of Gyri in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres (a), bilateral cerebellar oedema (arrow) (a) and hydrocephalus (arrow) (b).\n\nFigure 2. Pathological examination of the right cerebellar mass of a 60-year-old male patient that presented with numbness of the left lower extremity and worsening headache revealed the following: (a) histological photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen stained with haematoxylin and eosin showing diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with necrosis; (b) scattered large cells with large nucleoli (arrow) within a background of diffuse small lymphocytes; (c) binucleate cells (arrow) within a background of diffuse small lymphocytes; (d) scattered large cells (arrow) within a background of diffuse small lymphocytes; (e) immunohistochemical staining showed the large cells stained for CD30; (f) immunohistochemistry showed that the rate of positive staining for programmed death-ligand 1 was 15%. Scale bar 50 \u00b5m. The colour version of this figure is available at: http://imr.sagepub.com.\n\nPostoperative positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) imaging revealed no hypermetabolic lesion caused by residual lymphoma. There was a hypermetabolic lesion at the left cerebellar tonsil after surgery, which was considered to be lymphoma infiltration (Deauville Score 5) (Figure 3a). There were no abnormal findings in the rest of the body (suvs 2.4 in liver background and Max 1.3 in mediastinal large blood pool). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed there were 7.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 nucleated cells: 97% were mononuclear cells and 3% were multinucleated cells. Pan's test was positive and the total protein level in the CSF was 866 mg/l. No tumour cells were found in the CSF.\n\nFigure 3. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging findings of a 60-year-old male patient that presented with numbness of the left lower extremity and worsening headache revealed the following: (a) postoperative changes were seen in the right cerebellum. There was no hypermetabolic lesion caused by residual lymphoma in the operation area. There was a left cerebellar tonsillar hypermetabolic lesion, which was considered to be lymphoma infiltration (Deauville Score 5) (images taken on 28 February 2019); (b) compared with previous images taken on 28 February 2019, the right cerebellum showed post-operative changes. The left cerebellar tonsillar infiltrating lesion had receded (Deauville Score 1) (images taken on 19 July 2019). The colour version of this figure is available at: http://imr.sagepub.com.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with a primary CNS classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (MCHL) with the help of a multidisciplinary treatment meeting. The patient was first treated with 3 g/m2 methotrexate (i.v., once a day, day 1) and 1 g/m2 cytarabine (i.v., every 12 h, days 2\u2009+\u20093). Unfortunately, drug-induced acute renal injury and myelosuppression developed. Subsequently, the patient was treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies (200 mg sintilimab, i.v., once a day, day 1, every 3 weeks). After four courses of treatment, PET-CT imaging revealed no cell infiltration at the left cerebellar tonsil (Deauville Score 1) (Figure 3b). The CSF was normal and a complete response was achieved. Anti-PD-1 antibodies (200 mg sintilimab, i.v., once a day, day 1, every 3 weeks) was continued for two courses. During this period, lumbar puncture and intrathecal injections of 50 mg cytarabine (once a day, day 1) and 5 mg dexamethasone (once a day, day 1) were administrated for six courses. After six courses of treatment, there was no residual lesion on cranial MRI performed on 15 September 2019. No significant drug-related adverse events were observed. The patient has been followed up every 3 months and was last seen in December 2020. No relapse has occurred.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPrimary CNS-HL is extremely rare and there is no consensus on diagnosis, treatment and prognosis because the incidence is so low that large-scale clinical trials cannot be undertaken. EBV was found in 40\u201350% of the RS cells of patients, indicating that chronic immunosuppression may cause CNS-HL.4\u20137 The most common histological type of primary CNS-HL is MCHL (44%), followed by nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma (31%).4,8 The clinical features of CNS-HL are similar to those of other intracranial tumours, cranial nerve palsy, headache, papillary oedema of the optic nerve, epilepsy, and sensory impairment. The current patient had a chronic course of headaches culminating in limb numbness. PET-CT examination revealed multiple intracranial lesions and no extracranial lesions. A craniotomy biopsy confirmed a classic MCHL. Histopathological staining showed many small T cells, which were positive for T cell receptor gene rearrangement but had no significant morphological abnormalities. The origin of these T cells was unknown. Studies have shown that an increase in the number of regulatory T (Treg) cells may impair antitumour immunity and promote tumour development and growth.9,10 Treg cells in HL tissue may inhibit activation of CD8\u2009+\u2009and natural killer cells in response to tumour antigens by inhibiting the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and up-regulating the expression of Il-2ra-chain CD25, thus protecting RS cells from immune surveillance and clearance.11\u201314 It has been found that a high proportion of Treg cells in the microenvironment surrounding RS cells is associated with a significant reduction in disease-free survival time.15Whether excessive Treg cells may be have been a risk factor for CNS-HL in this current patient remains unknown.\n\nThe role of EBV infection in systemic and primary CNS-HL has also been proposed.4 The presence of EBV in RS cells is associated with an increase of Treg cells in the tumour microenvironment.5 Fortunately, the presence of EBV in patients with HL does not affect the survival of these patients.16 In this current patient, EBERs staining was positive in the biopsy. The peripheral blood EBV-DNA was 1.26 x 104 copies/ml. EBV infection may also be one of the risk factors for primary CNS-HL. Although there is no standard treatment for CNS-HL, surgical resection, local radiotherapy, whole brain radiotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy, intrathecal injection and autotransplantation have all been used.17\u201321 Considering the possibility of serious side-effects from whole brain radiotherapy, the current patient received a chemotherapy regimen of high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine combined with lumbar puncture plus intrathecal chemotherapy. After a course of this treatment, the patient developed severe renal impairment and bone marrow suppression.\n\nAnti-PD-1 antibody is now used to treat refractory and recurrent HL and it has been investigated as a first-line treatment for HL in several clinical studies.22 It has been reported that 82% of patients with classic HL expressed PD-L on the surface of tumour cells and EBV infection increased the expression of PD-L on RS cells in these patients.22,23 Engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 transduces a signal that inhibits T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic function.23 As the current case had PD-L1 immunostaining (15%) in the biopsy specimen, anti-PD-1 was used in the subsequent treatment regimen. Fortunately, this patient achieved complete remission after four treatment courses and no significant drug-related adverse events were observed.\n\nIn conclusion, primary CNS-HL is extremely rare. This current case report describes a male patient with an EBV-positive primary CNS-HL. These current findings suggest that EBV infection and overexpression of Treg cells might have been risk factors for primary CNS-HL in this patient. The patient achieved complete remission with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment and is currently under close follow-up observation. A better understanding of the role of EBV infection, Treg cells and PD-L1 in the pathogenesis of CNS-HL could lead to more effective treatments (such as immunotherapy) that are less toxic than conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\nAuthor contributions: H.F. and T.L. were mainly responsible for the overall diagnosis and treatment of the patient.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nRole of placental inflammatory mediators and growth factors in patients with rheumatic diseases with a focus on systemic sclerosis.\n\nABSTRACT:\nPregnancy in SSc is burdened with an increased risk of obstetric complications. Little is known about the underlying placental alterations. This study aimed to better understand pathological changes and the role of inflammation in SSc placentas. Leucocyte infiltration, inflammatory mediators and atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2) expression in SSc placentas were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (ORD) and healthy controls (HC).\n\n\n\nA case-control study was conducted on eight pregnant SSc patients compared with 16 patients with ORD and 16 HC matched for gestational age. Clinical data were collected. Placentas were obtained for histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry (CD3, CD20, CD11c, CD68, ACKR2). Samples from four SSc, eight ORD and eight HC were analysed by qPCR for ACKR2 expression and by multiplex assay for cytokines, chemokines and growth factors involved in angiogenesis and inflammation.\n\n\n\nThe number of placental CD3, CD68 and CD11 cells was significantly higher in patients affected by rheumatic diseases (SSc+ORD) compared with HC. Hepatocyte growth factor was significantly increased in the group of rheumatic diseases patients (SSc+ORD) compared with HC, while chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) was significantly higher in SSc patients compared with ORD and HC. CCL5 levels directly correlated with the number of all local inflammatory cells and higher levels were associated with histological villitis.\n\n\n\nInflammatory alterations characterize placentas from rheumatic disease patients and could predispose to obstetric complications in these subjects.\n\nTEXT:\npmc Rheumatology key messages\n\nPlacental leukocytes are more numerous in rheumatic diseases, with a possible role in obstetric complications.\n\nHGF placental levels are higher in rheumatic diseases than in controls and may promote placentation.\n\nCCL5 expression is higher in SSc placentas and this supports its pathogenetic role.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPatients with rheumatic diseases (RD), especially connective tissue diseases, are at increased risk of obstetric complications and have historically been advised against pregnancy. In recent years, contraindications have been revised in light of new knowledge of the pathogenesis of the complications and of therapies for their management [1\u20134].\n\nMost studies examining fetal outcome and placental changes in RD concern SLE and APS. Preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia are frequent complications in SLE [5] and are associated with trophoblast alterations, villitis, vasculopathy and a high number of inflammatory cells [6, 7]. In APS the higher risk of abortion, stillbirth, IUGR and preterm birth [8] is associated with trophoblast alterations, infarction and a higher number of placental inflammatory cells [9, 10]. In chronic arthritis, a slightly increased risk of spontaneous abortion or preterm birth compared with healthy population has been described and a lot of studies have been performed with respect to therapy [11], but no histological analysis of the placenta has been conducted so far.\n\nAn Italian multicentre study showed that women with SSc have a higher than normal risk of IUGR, preterm delivery and very low birth weight babies [12]. In a case series of 13 SSc patients [13], five showed decidual vasculopathy, associated with fetal death in four cases. The vessels had increased number of perivascular macrophages, immunoglobulin deposits and CD4 lymphocytes compared with healthy controls. A study of three cases [14] described decidual vasculopathy, villous hypovascularity, stromal fibrosis, increased syncytiotrophoblast knotting and infarcts in the placentas of SSc patients compared with healthy controls. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased staining for VEGF, VEGF receptor 2, connective tissue growth factor and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in myofibroblasts in SSc patients, as signs of altered vascular remodelling and fibrosis.\n\nWe are particularly interested in the role of the atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2), which does not signal in response to chemokines, but internalizes ligand and targets it for intracellular degradation, acting as a chemokine \u2018scavenger\u2019 [15]. It is highly expressed in trophoblasts and may be important in reducing the risk of inflammation-related miscarriage, minimizing inflammatory chemokine exchange between mother and fetus [16]. ACKR2 knock out mice have fetal loss if infused with antiphospholipid antibodies or lipopolysaccharides [17]. Furthermore, ACKR2 levels are higher in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SSc compared with healthy controls [18].\n\nThe aim of our study was to analyse the histopathological placental features of a cohort of SSc patients, with a focus on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of obstetric complications and to determine whether placental ACKR2 might have a role in it.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients\n\nPatients attending the Rheumatology Unit of the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo\u2019s Foundation in Pavia, Italy, who fulfilled the 2013 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SSc [19] and who consecutively became pregnant between 2013 and 2018, were enrolled in this prospective study. Pregnant patients with other RD (ORD) classified according to the current classification criteria [20\u201323] were enrolled as the first control group and healthy pregnant women followed at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Unit formed the second control group (healthy controls, HC). Patients for comparison groups were consecutively enrolled if matched to SSc patients by age, body mass index and week of delivery, with a ratio of 1:2:2. Patients were followed up by the same physicians during pregnancy. Organ involvement was evaluated according to the presence of signs and symptoms of disease at the visits and imaging data. Pulmonary involvement was recorded if the chest X-ray, high resolution CT scan of the thorax, pulmonary function tests or echocardiography had previously given an indication of interstitial or vasculopathic lung disease. Laboratory tests, including autoantibodies, were evaluated using commercially available kits.\n\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The local ethics committee has approved the research protocol and all patients provided their written informed consent to use their placentas in the study.\n\nMacroscopic and histopathological analysis\n\nPlacentas were weighed and underwent macroscopic examination. Full thickness samples were obtained, fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (3\u2009\u00b5m) were stained with haematoxylin, eosin and Masson\u2019s trichrome for histopathological examination according to the most recent guidelines [24] by an expert pathologist who was blind to sample classification.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nParaffin-embedded full thickness placental samples were sliced into 3\u2009\u00b5m sections, dewaxed and heated in 0.01\u2009M pH 6 sodium citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. After blocking endogenous peroxidase activity and non-specific binding, the sections were incubated overnight with the following primary antihuman antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-CD3 (F7.2.38, 1:70, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), mouse monoclonal anti-CD20 (L26, 1:126, Dako), mouse monoclonal anti-CD68 (PG-M1, 1:30, Dako), rabbit monoclonal anti-CD11c (EP1347Y, 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and rabbit polyclonal anti-ACKR2 (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Sections were then incubated with the appropriate chromogenic secondary antibody (ImmPRESS Polymer Detection Kit, anti-rabbit and anti-mouse, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The immunoreactivity was developed using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories) as chromogen. Isotype-matched control antibodies were included as a negative control and tonsil sections as a positive control. The sections were observed under a light microscope (Olympus BX43, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed by digital camera (DP22 using Olympus Cell Sense Entry 2.2 for imaging acquisition).\n\nAnalysis of immunostaining\n\nThe immunostaining for CD3, CD20, CD11c and CD68 was assessed as follow. Photographs were taken of 10 random fields (\u00d740 magnification) along the sections and representative of all placental layers. Stained cells were counted by two blinded observers and normalized to the tissue area. The percentage of stained area was assessed in sections stained for ACKR2 and with Masson\u2019s thrichrome. ImageJ 2.0 software was used to measure stained area and total area of tissue represented in the fields examined.\n\nReal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction\n\nRandom parenchymal biopsies were performed in half of the samples and stored in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at \u221280\u00b0C. To extract RNA, samples were lysed and homogenized in \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and RLT buffer by shaking with steel beads in a Tissue Lyser LT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA was then extracted and purified from the fluid phase using the RNeasy Mini extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified RNA was converted to cDNA using the high capacity RNA to cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were tested in triplicate and qPCR for ACKR2 was performed as previously described [25]. ACKR2 transcript levels were normalized to TATA-binding protein. The samples were run on a QuantStudio 7 flex machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nProtein extraction and multiplex cytokine assay\n\nPlacental samples were suspended in tissue extraction buffer (homemade with 100\u2009mM pH 7.4 Tris, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM EGTA, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitors), homogenized and the concentration of total proteins in the supernatant was determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentration in the samples was normalized to the sample with the lowest concentration. Samples were analysed as per protocol using a 30-Plex bioassay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) measuring interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)9, CXCL10, CCL11, VEGF, fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nFor all statistical tests, non-parametric data were analysed using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test and parametric data using Student\u2019s unpaired t-test. For multiple comparisons, a Kruskal\u2013Wallis correction was applied to the test. To detect significant correlation between variables, Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient was used, where r\u2009=\u20091 denotes a perfect positive correlation and r\u2009=\u2009\u22121 a perfect negative correlation. P\u2009<\u20090.05 denotes significant differences. Comparisons were also made between each of the following groups: SSc, SLE, UCTD, defined connective tissue disease (SSc+SLE+Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome) patients; SSc patients with obstetric complications, SSc patients without obstetric complications, SSC+ORD patients with obstetric complications, SSc+ORD patients without obstetric complications, HC, all complicated pregnancies, patients who had preeclampsia, patients with poor fetal outcome (IUGR, small for gestational age, death), patients with preterm birth, patients with premature rupture of membranes, all non-complicated pregnancies.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using Prism 8.0.2 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).\n\nResults\n\nMain clinical features of the study patients\n\nA total of eight patients affected by SSc, 16 with ORD and 16 HC were enrolled in the study. All SSc patients but one took low dose acetylsalicylic acid during pregnancy and one patient took prednisolone 4\u2009mg daily in addition. Their main clinical and pregnancy-related features are shown in Table\u00a01.\n\nTable 1 Characteristics of SSc patients\n\nPatient\tDisease subset\tDuration of disease, years\tmRSS\tAutoantibodies\tInternal organ involvement\tTherapy before/during (b/d) pregnancy\tBMI, kg/m2\tComorbidities and risk factors\tAge at conception, years\tGestational week at delivery\tObstetric complications\tNewborn weight, g\tPlacental characteristics (descriptive)\t\n1a\tlc-SSc\t3\t2\tACA\tNone\tb and d: levothyroxine, ASA\t21.5\tGestational hypothyroidism\t34\t38\u2009+\u20096\tPROM\t3170\tDystrophic calcifications, mild acute chorioamnionitis\t\n2a\tlc-SSc\t1\t4\tACA\tGastrointestinal\tb: prostanoids.\n\nd: MPD 4\u2009mg\n\n\t23.8\t\u2014\t38\t36\tHELLP,\n\npreterm birth\n\n\t2660\tHypoxic hypervascularization, syncytial knots, decidual inflammation\t\n3a\tdc-SSc\t12\t13\tAnti-Scl70\tNone\tb: bosentan, prostanoids.\n\nd: CCB, ASA\n\n\t28.1\t\u2014\t31\t40\t\u2014\t3175\tFocal subchorial fibrin deposits\t\n4a\tdc-SSc\t1\t3\tAnti-Scl70\tNone\tb and d: ASA\t22.6\t\u2014\t33\t40\tPreeclampsia\t3690\tMild acute chorioamnionitis, low grade chronic villitis, few dystrophic calcifications\t\n5\tdc-SSc\t1\t2\tAnti-Scl70\tNone\tb and d: ASA\t23.1\t\u2014\t29\t36\u2009+\u20094\tPreterm birth\t2800\tDystrophic calcifications, mild acute chorioamnionitis, fibrin deposits\t\n6\tdc-SSc\t4\t6\tAnti-Scl70\tNone\tb: prostanoids. d: levothyroxine, ASA\t26\tHashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis\t29\t40\t\u2014\t3140\tRare avascular villi, perivillous and villous fibrin deposits, focal chronic villitis\t\n7\tdc-SSc\t2\t2\tAnti-Scl70\tNone\tb: CCB\n\nd: LMWH, ASA\n\n\t25.5\t\u2014\t35\t26\tPreterm birth, IUGR, HELLP\t511, SGA\tVillous haemorrhage, areas of infarction, decidual arteriopathy, mural thrombi\t\n8\tdc-SSc\t7\t12\tAnti-Scl70\tGastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary\tb: CCB\n\nd: ASA\n\n\t27\t\u2014\t34\t30\u2009+\u20096\tPreterm birth, neonatal death\t1428\tChronic decidual inflammation, decidual arteriopathy\t\na Patient with both paraffin and frozen samples.

Their main clinical and pregnancy-related features are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, available at Rheumatology online.\n\nMacroscopic and histopathological findings\n\nNo macroscopic placental differences (dimension, weight) were observed between groups. At histological examination, no significant difference (P\u2009>\u20090.05) was found between groups, or between the HC vs the SSc patients and vs the RD patients (SSc+ORD) regarding the presence of deciduitis, villitis, materno-fetal inflammation, placental abruption, vascular alterations or fibrin deposits. The latter was examined both by histopathological examination and by Masson\u2019s trichrome staining. The histopathological data did not show any correlation or association with disease-related features as disease subset, disease duration, modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) and organ involvement.\n\nInflammatory cells within placentas\n\nThe number of placental CD3 and CD11c+ cells found by immunohistochemistry was significantly higher in patients affected by RD (SSc+ORD) compared with HC. The SSc group alone did not statistically differ from the ORD group nor the HC, possibly due to a smaller sample size. The number of placental CD68+ cells was significantly higher in both the SSc and ORD groups compared with HC (Fig.\u00a01). Patients with histological evidence of placental abruption had a higher number of placental CD68+ cells, regardless of diagnosis (Fig.\u00a02).\n\nFig. 1 Immunohistochemical analysis\n\n(A) CD3, CD11c and CD68 expression in placentas from patients with SSc, other rheumatic diseases (ORD) and healthy controls (HC).

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis showed very high transcript levels in all groups, without significant differences between them. Moreover, ACKR2 expression and transcription levels did not correlate with any clinical (disease subset, disease duration, mRSS, internal organ involvement) or obstetric variable (presence of complications, week of delivery, presence of histological alterations as above detailed).\n\nACKR2 transcript levels correlated with the percentage of stained area in immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S2, available at Rheumatology online), indicating concordance with protein expression.\n\nInflammatory mediators and growth factors in placenta\n\nWe measured levels of a broad range of inflammatory mediators and growth factors in the placentas from four SSc patients (two dc-SSc, two lc-SSc), eight patients affected by ORD and eight HC. Only those molecules showing significant differences between groups were considered in further analyses and in clinical correlates. Specifically, HGF was significantly increased in RD patients (SSc+ORD) compared with HC (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and CCL5 was significantly higher in SSc patients compared with ORD (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and with HC (P\u2009<\u20090.01) (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nFig. 3 HGF and CCL5 placental levels\n\nLevels of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) in healthy controls (HC), patients with other rheumatic diseases (ORD) and SSc. *P\u00a0<0.05, **P\u00a0<0.01, ns: not significant.\n\nWhen analysing SSc vs HC group, HGF levels were not different (P\u2009>\u20090.05), while CCL5 levels were significantly higher (P\u2009<\u20090.01).\n\nHGF levels inversely correlated with the gestational week at delivery (Fig.\u00a04A) and when the disease groups were analysed separately, a significant inverse correlation was seen in the rheumatic disease patients group (SSc+ORD), but not in HC (Fig.\u00a04B and C). The same was detected for placental weight, which inversely correlated with HGF in patients affected by RD (Supplementary Fig. S3, available at Rheumatology online). Accordingly, HGF levels were higher in patients with preterm delivery, regardless of the diagnosis (Fig.\u00a04D). Higher levels of placental CCL5 were associated with histological villitis (Fig.\u00a04E).\n\nFig. 4 HGF/CCL5 levels and obstetric complications\n\n(A) Considering all patients, levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inversely correlated with the gestational week at delivery (r\u2009=\u20090.47, P\u2009<\u20090.05). (B, C) The inverse correlation is maintained in the rheumatic diseases group [other rheumatic diseases (ORD)+SSc; r\u2009=\u20090.5, P\u2009<\u20090.05] (B), but not in the healthy controls (HC) group (P\u2009>\u20090.05) (C). (D) Differences in HGF levels in patients with and without preterm delivery.

Moreover, the number of CD3+ cells directly correlated with the number of CD20+ and CD11c+ cells. The number of CD68+ cells directly correlated with the number of CD11c+ cells and with decidual HGF levels (see Table\u00a02 for descriptive statistics presented as r-values).\n\nTable 2 Correlations between the number of inflammatory cells, ACKR2 transcript, HGF and CCL5 levels\n\n\tCD3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCD3\t1\tCD20\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCD20\t0.41**\t1\tCD11c\t\t\t\t\t\nCD11c\t0.37**\t0.10\t1\tCD68\t\t\t\t\nCD68\t0.25\t0.19\t0.49***\t1\tACKR2\t\t\t\nACKR2\t\u22120.01\t0.1\t\u22120.4\t\u22120.5\t1\tHGF\t\t\nHGF\t0.1\t\u22120.3\t0.2\t0.5**\t\u22120.2\t1\tCCL5\t\nCCL5\t0.3*\t0.4**\t0.4*\t0.3*\t\u22120.2\t0.02\t1\t\nCorrelation coefficients obtained from Spearman tests. *P\u00a0<0.05, **P\u00a0<0.01, ***P\u00a0<0.001. ACKR2: atypical chemokine receptor 2; CCL5: chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5; HGF: hepatocyte growth factor.\n\nComparisons between distinct rheumatic diseases\n\nAs the ORD group included heterogeneous RD, we analysed if any differences in placental leukocytes, inflammatory mediators or growth factors, or ACKR2 levels could be detected among them. In particular, we considered SSc vs SLE patients, SSc vs UCTD patients, SLE vs UCTD patients and UCTD vs defined connective tissue disease (SSc+SLE+SjS). CD20+ cells were higher in placentas from defined connective tissue diseases compared with UCTD (P\u2009<\u20090.01). No other significant findings were observed between groups, except from a trend toward higher placental CCL5 levels (P\u2009=\u20090.06) in SSc compared with UCTD patients.\n\nComparisons between successful and complicated pregnancies\n\nWe investigated if any distinctive alteration could be found in patients with obstetric complications. Therefore, we considered sub-groups of patients and analysed if differences could be detected in placental CD3+, CD20+, CD11c+, CD68+ cells, ACKR2 expression and transcription, inflammatory mediators and growth factors. No significant findings have been detected, except from a trend toward higher placental CD68+ cells (P\u2009=\u20090.07) and HGF (P\u2009=\u20090.06) in preterm placentas and to higher CCL5 in patients with preeclampsia (P\u2009=\u20090.07).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study we analysed how inflammation might play a role in obstetric complications that frequently occur in the pregnancies of patients affected by RD, in particular SSc. To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort thus far analysed in SSc.\n\nWe found that patients with RD had higher numbers of placental leukocytes, specifically T lymphocytes (CD3+ cells), antigen-presenting cells (APCs, CD11+ cells) and macrophages (CD68+ cells), compared with HC.\n\nOur results are in line with and reinforce previous literature showing an increased number of placental leukocytes in these patients [6, 7, 9, 10]. This has been associated with obstetric complications such as IUGR, preeclampsia, fetal death and preterm delivery [26\u201328]. Placental macrophage infiltration might play a role in reducing trophoblastic invasion, in placental abruption [9, 29] and in preterm labour [30]. In addition, an association between high maternal serum and placental concentrations of M-CSF with IUGR [31] and preeclampsia [32] has been reported. Other evidence suggests that placental T cell infiltration and imbalance are important in the aetiopathogenesis of preeclampsia [33]. In our population a higher number of placental macrophages was associated with placental abruption and a trend towards higher CD68+ cells in preterm placentas was shown, regardless of diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. No other significant association was found between inflammatory cell numbers and obstetric complications, considering SSc patients, RD patients or all complicated pregnancies regardless of diagnosis. It is possible that with our small population we did not have enough statistical power to detect more subtle differences in other leucocyte populations among patients with and without obstetric complications (and in sub-groups of rheumatic diseases patients). Therefore, we can only speculate that SSc patients, and in general RD women, may be more predisposed to obstetric complications due to the development of placental inflammatory alterations.\n\nThe proangiogenic factor HGF [34] was higher in patients with RD (SSc+ORD) compared with HC. In placenta, HGF is produced by stromal cells of the villous mesenchyme and stimulates trophoblast invasion in the decidua [35]. Its levels are reduced in hypoxic conditions and in patients with preeclampsia [36]. It might be speculated that patients with RD need higher levels of HGF to promote trophoblast invasion and placentation. In support of this, in our population HGF levels inversely correlated with gestational week and placental weight in patients with RD but not in controls, suggesting an important role of this factor in women affected by autoimmune diseases, with higher levels in early stages when placenta is still developing and lower values in the end stages of pregnancy.\n\nAn important insight provided by our study concerns CCL5, which was significantly higher in placenta from patients with SSc compared with ORD and HC, with no difference between the latter two groups and which appeared to be related to villitis and to preeclampsia, regardless of rheumatic disease, although the latter association did not reach full statistical significance. These may indicate a disease specific role of this chemokine in SSc. CCL5 mediates trafficking and activation of several immune cells [37]. An association has been demonstrated between a specific polymorphism of the gene coding for CCL5 and susceptibility for SSc [38]. CCL5 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of perivascular inflammation, vascular dysfunction [39, 40], hepatic and renal fibrosis [41\u201343], and myocardial remodelling [44]. Furthermore, CCL5 is highly expressed in the skin of patients with SSc, while no expression has been found in the skin of controls [45]. Specifically, CCL5 is highly expressed in skin in early SSc, as are CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CX3CL1. In advanced stages CCL7 and CXCL10 predominate [46]. The early expression of CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 is also observed in a mouse model of scleroderma, with a subsequent rapid reduction of CCL5 and maintained high expression of CCL2 and CCL3 [47]. Another study showed that CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 were significantly higher in serum of patients with SSc than in controls and therapy with prostaglandins down-regulated CCL2 and CCL5, suggesting an effect of vasodilator therapy on inflammation in SSc [48]. Considering the placenta as a new organ, with possible gradual involvement by the disease, CCL5 could be a key regulator of the pathological process. Through its chemoattractive activity it could promote the formation of a placental inflammatory infiltrate, and in fact in this study we have shown a correlation between CCL5 levels and leukocytes infiltration. Moreover, it could be a key factor in the development of vascular alterations and, in the subsequent stages, of fibrosis.\n\nWe did not find different levels of transcription or expression of placental ACKR2 in SSc or ORD compared with HC. In a previous study, ACKR2 levels were higher in PBMCs of SSc patients compared with controls [18]. Furthermore, ACKR2 was elevated in PBMCs and synovial tissue of patients with inflammatory arthropathies [49]. In our population, PBMCs from pregnant patients were not always available and thus we could not perform a group analysis, but it would be interesting in future studies to compare PBMCs and placental levels of ACKR2. A possible explanation for similar ACKR2 levels in our groups could be that ACKR2 is strongly expressed in placenta and in our patients its immunomodulatory role was sufficient to control the inflammation induced by the inflammatory cells present in the tissue. In fact, the number of leukocytes, although higher in patients with RD, was not associated with obstetric complications, except from placental abruption. The only ACKR2 ligand found to be elevated was CCL5 in patients with SSc, underlining a prominent activity of this chemokine in these patients.\n\nIn conclusion, there is increased placental leucocyte infiltration in patients with RD and this may contribute to the risk of complications. High HGF levels could represent a protective mechanism for an adequate placentation. In SSc, CCL5 might be a key factor, with a role in chemotaxis, vascular remodelling and fibrosis development.\n\nThis could be considered a pilot study and a larger population of SSc and RD patients should be enrolled in order to improve statistical power, perhaps in a multicentric study. The detection of defined inflammatory alterations could help in understanding the pathogenesis of the poor outcomes affecting SSc and RD pregnancies. Moreover, an analysis of inflammatory features in relation to therapy could be performed, to detect if low dose corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, other immunosuppressants or anti-platelet agents could have a role in SSc and RD placental alterations and in specific obstetric complications. In addition, a comparison between alterations in placental tissue and peripheral blood could lead to the detection of serum markers predictive of higher-risk pregnancies, easy to detect at early stages, when a timely personalized pharmacological intervention may be performed to prevent complications.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nkeaa782_Supplementary_Data Click here for additional data file.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors wish to thank Ms Barbara Vitolo for her valuable support to this project, her precious contribution in sample collection, preparation and storage and for the critical review of the manuscript.\n\nFunding: This work was supported by grants from a Wellcome Trust Investigation Award [Grant number 099251/Z/12/Z] and the UK Medical Research Council [Grant number MR/M019764/1].\n\nDisclosure statement: H.J. was funded by the Chief Scientist Office during the conduct of the study.

Cytomegalovirus has been identified as a risk factor for graft rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Viral clearance is not achieved in all patients despite standard antiviral therapy; therefore, there is great interest in prevention and treatment strategies, as use of specific cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin, to avoid progression to organ involvement. Dose regimen of specific cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin is not well studied, especially in cytomegalovirus disease. We present the case of late onset of tissue invasive disease, pneumonitis, in young female patient after heart transplantation with acute renal failure, successfully treated with frequent intermittent cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin followed by renal dosed ganciclovir.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nStandard treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or CMV disease after solid organ transplantation is intravenous ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir, but even when exposure to standard antiviral drugs is adequate, viral clearance is not always achieved.1\u20133 In some cases, underexposure or discontinuation of standard antiviral drugs is required, leading to other treatments, as CMV immunoglobulin (CMVIG), which can be used in the treatment of CMV infection or disease in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs).3\u20135 There is lack of data especially of effective dose regimen.4,5 We present the case of late-onset CMV pneumonitis successfully treated by CMVIG followed by renal dosed ganciclovir in heart transplant patient with renal failure.\n\nCase report\n\n\\A 40-year-old female, who received heart transplantation in January 2019, developed in June 2019 fatigue, mild dyspnoa and fever. She was treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2008 and 2014 for relapse. In November 2014, she developed overt congestive heart failure, leading to left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and temporary right ventricular assist support (RVAD). In the course of next 3\u2009years, she developed pneumonia, sepsis and successfully treated pump thrombosis. At the time of heart transplantation, donor was seropositive for CMV and she was CMV-negative (D+/R\u2212), defined as high-risk serostatus. Initial anti-CMV prophylaxis was ganciclovir I.V., switched to valganciclovir (standard dose) for 24\u2009weeks after heart transplantation. Post-transplant CMV viral load was undetectable during prophylaxis period. The induction therapy at transplantation comprised thymoglobulin and maintenance therapy of mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone and cyclosporine. At admission, in June 2019, severe chronic renal failure (glomerular filtration rate: 32\u2009mL/min) was attributed to immunosuppressive treatment and pre-renal origin. Other findings were not remarkable, except for elevated NT-pro-BNP levels. There was no sign of hypogammaglobulinemia. Chest X-ray was inconclusive and led to multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) of the thorax which revealed bilateral pneumonitis with ground-glass opacification and diffuse consolidation (Figure 1(a)). CMV viral load at admission was elevated up to 528,102\u2009UI/mL (Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas Taqman CMV). Bronchoalveolar lavage proved polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for CMV and negative for other known pathogens, as well as serum. Because of acute renal failure at admission, underexposure to standard antiviral agent, ganciclovir I.V., was necessary and led to decision to start treatment with CMVIG. Treatment of CMVIG was defined as \u201cintensive\u201d regimen of 2\u2009mg/kg (100\u2009mL I.V.) given every 48\u201372\u2009h for a total of six doses and additional doses weekly after initial regimen. Renal dosed ganciclovir I.V. was subsequently added during the period of first week. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus levels were at lower dose for 3\u2009weeks, and prednisone dosage was increased. Myocardial biopsy procedure samples revealed mild graft rejection-grade ISHLT (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation), ACR (acute cellular rejection) 1R (1B) and AMR (antibody-mediated rejection) grade 0. Echocardiography showed no significant signs of graft rejection. CMV viral load consistently lowered with combined therapy (Figure 1(c)) and became undetectable after 6\u2009weeks of therapy (<150 CMV DNA copies/mL). CMV viral load remains undetectable in the follow-up. The patient made a complete clinical recovery and was discharged with maintenance renal dosed valganciclovir therapy and immunosuppression (Figure 1(b)). She has no signs of rejection on repeated graft myocardial biopsy.\n\nFigure 1.

Drop of CMV DNA level from up to 528,102 copies/mL to 533 copies/mL.\n\nCMVIG: cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe highest rates of both CMV infection and disease in SOTR are seen in lung and heart\u2013lung transplant patients, up to approximately 40%.1,2 CMV is a risk factor for graft rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality; standard intravenous ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir are used for CMV prophylaxis, infection and disease.3\u20135 Pre-transplant testing of CMV serostatus of donor and recipient (D/R) are key predictors of the risk of CMV involvement after transplant and guide decisions on antiviral prophylaxis or preemptive treatment, high risk defined as donor positive and recipient negative serostatus (D+/R\u2212).5,6 Available data suggest that CMVIG is beneficial prophylactic treatment in preventing CMV disease, particularly in high risk, (D+/R\u2212) heart and lung transplant patients, but prophylaxis with CMVIG alone is not advisable.5\u20138 Dose regimen of specific CMVIG is not well studied and most of the data, especially in use other than prophylaxis as late-onset CMV infiltrative disease, are drawn from few published cases.5\u20137 Late-onset CMV disease is defined as disease occurring after prophylaxis discontinuation, as in our patient.5 Post-transplant CMV disease can occur because of transmission from the transplanted organ, reactivation of latent infection or in seronegative transplant patients after a primary infection.5,6 Transplant-specific \u201cindirect effects\u201d of CMV as higher rates of all types of infection can also occure.5 There is an increased risk of complications in case of short course of antiviral prophylaxis compared with extended antiviral prophylaxis, but prolonged therapy of ganciclovir may lead to severe toxicity, most dangerous being bone marrow toxicity with severe cytopenia.9 Late onset of CMV disease is of particular concern. If invasive disease develops or ganciclovir resistance emerges, a drug with significant nephrotoxicity, foscarnet, can be used. Available data suggest that CMVIG as addition to standard antiviral therapy, may provide an additional benefit in preventing CMV disease or chronic rejection in thoracic transplant recipients.10 CMVIG has favorable safety profile compared with other antiviral agents, therefore, can be safely used as therapy in patients with leucopenia due to ganciclovir, in patients who are under intense immunosuppression or in patients who are intolerant to antiviral agents or need renal adjusted doses.10 Most of the data support prophylactic use of CMVIG in addition to standard antiviral drugs, but dose and efficacy primarily for the treatment of CMV disease are yet to be proven. A retrospective study by Valantine et al.11 of D+/R\u2212 transplant patients found that the rate of CMV disease was significantly lower and survival increased in the group that received the combination of CMVIG and ganciclovir-combined therapy. Zamora et al.12 found that CMV disease was significantly lower in high-risk (D+/R\u2212) lung transplant recipients receiving valganciclovir/ganciclovir and CMVIG, requiring length of valganciclovir prophylaxis at least 180\u2009days. All studies highlighted the issues of further investigation and possible assessment of effective dosing of CMVIG. Adequately sized prospective studies of CMV infection and disease treatment in SOTR and investigation of immunomodulatory effect of CMVIG that could partially explain some of the benefits observed with CMVIG are lacking. Use of CMVIG is up to expert consensus in specific transplant centers, mainly adding CMVIG to standard antiviral therapy for high-risk patients.12 Data supporting particular approach in treatment of CMV disease in SOTR are limited. In our case, we successfully used CMVIG 2\u2009mg/kg I.V., every 48\u201372\u2009h as intense intermittent treatment, followed by renal dosed ganciclovir in the treatment of CMV pneumonitis in heart transplant patient.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe suggest that CMVIG therapy and proposed \u201cintense\u201d regimen of specific dosages, along with titration of immunosuppressants can be safely used as treatment of late-onset infiltrative CMV disease in transplant patients who need reduced dose of standard antiviral drugs as in our case. Considering the era of new viral pathogens, control of CMV by adopted therapy protocols so that graft loss in transplant patients does not occur is paramount.\n\nAuthor contributions: All authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publication.\n\nDeclaration of conflicting interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\n\nEthical approval: Our institution does not require ethical approval for reporting individual cases or case series.\n\nFunding: The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\n\nInformed consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for their anonymized information to be published in this article.\n\nORCID iD: Sandra Jaksic Jurinjak https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7349-6137",

There are only a few case reports of autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) as a treatment for SPS.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo describe the UK experience of treating refractory SPS with auto-HSCT.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween 2015 and 2019, 10 patients with SPS were referred to our institution for consideration of auto-HSCT. Eight patients were deemed suitable for autograft and four were treated. Of the treated patients, three had classical SPS and one had the progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus variant. All patients were significantly disabled and had failed conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Patients were mobilised with Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 2\u00a0g/m2\u2009+\u2009G-CSF and conditioned with Cy 200\u00a0mg/kg\u2009+\u2009ATG followed by auto-HSCT.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDespite their significantly reduced performance status, all patients tolerated the procedure with no unexpected toxicities. Following autograft, all patients improved symptomatically and stopped all forms of immunosuppressive therapies. Two patients were able to ambulate independently from being wheelchair dependent. One patient's walking distance improved from 300\u00a0meters to 5 miles and one patient's ambulation improved from being confined to a wheelchair to be able to walk with a frame. Two patients became seronegative for anti-GAD antibodies and normalised their neurophysiological abnormalities.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAuto-HSCT is an intensive but well tolerated and effective treatment option for patients with SPS refractory to conventional immunotherapy. Further work is warranted to optimise patient selection and establish the efficacy, long-term safety, and cost-effectiveness of this treatment.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\nStiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterised by progressive axial muscle stiffness, central nervous system hyper-excitability, and stimulus sensitive painful muscle spasms. Needle electromyography (EMG) often shows continuous motor unit activity at rest [1, 2]. The combination of these features represents the classical form of SPS which is associated with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) in around 70% of cases [3].\n\nOther variants include focal or segmental SPS (stiff limb or stiff trunk), para-neoplastic SPS and progressive encephalomyelitis\u00a0with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), which in addition to the classic symptoms of SPS, manifests with brainstem signs, hyperekplexia, myoclonus, ataxia and dysautonomia. PERM is associated with anti-glycine receptor antibodies and is reported to be more responsive to immunotherapy [4\u20136]. Stiff Person Spectrum Disorder has recently been suggested as an overarching term to encompass the various clinical presentations of this condition.\n\nThe direct pathological role of the anti-GAD and anti-glycine receptors antibodies is uncertain. The immune-mediated pathogenesis of SPS is evidenced by co-existing autoimmune diseases and partial response to treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasmapheresis and other immunosuppressive therapies including rituximab, mycophenolate and azathioprine [4]. Symptomatic improvement can be achieved using agents such as diazepam, dantrolene, gabapentin or baclofen. Nonetheless, SPS remains a significantly disabling condition with over half of patients requiring long term mobility aids [7].\n\nAutologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (auto-HSCT) has been reported as a treatment option in a limited number of SPS patients with promising results [8]. Here we describe the UK\u2019s experience in using auto-HSCT to treat patients with refractory SPS.\n\nMethods\nBetween 2015 and 2019 ten patients with SPS were referred to our institution, one of three national referral centres in the UK, for consideration of auto-HSCT from different UK and European centres. Patients\u2019 clinical characteristics and outcomes are summarised in Table\u00a01. All patients were assessed in a joint neurology and haematology transplant clinic. Before considering auto-HSCT the following criteria needed to be met: (1) established diagnosis of SPS; (2) significant disability secondary to SPS; (3) failure of at least one form of immunotherapy; and (4) absence of significant co-morbidities that would increase mortality risk associated with auto-HSCT. Funding requests from the NHS were made for UK patients.Table\u00a01 Summary of patients\u2019 demographics, clinical phenotypes, neurophysiological and serological profiles, treatments tried and outcomes of patients with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) referred for consideration of auto-HSCT\n\nPatient\tAge/gender\tSPS phenotype\tCo-morbidities\tEMG/blink reflex\tAntibodies\tImmunotherapy tried\tDisease duration before HSCT\tNeurological outcome after HSCT\t\nA\t36/F\tClassical SPS\tNone\tContinuous motor unit activity/blink reflex hyperexcitability\tGAD\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml\tIVIG\n\nPlasmapheresis\n\n\t8\u00a0years\tTwo years from HSCT:\n\nMarked clinical improvement (wheelchair to independent walking)\n\nNo further immunotherapy needed\n\nAnti-GAD and EMG remain positive\n\n\t\nB\t48/F\tClassical SPS\tPulmonary sarcoidosis\n\nType 1 diabetes\n\nPeripheral neuropathy\n\n\tContinuous motor unit activity/blink reflex hyperexcitability\tGAD\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml\tIVIG\n\nRituximab\n\n\t4\u00a0years\tOne year from HSCT:\n\nMarked clinical improvement (wheelchair to independent walking)\n\nNo further immunotherapy needed\n\nAnti-GAD and EMG became negative\n\n\t\nC\t37/F\tClassical SPS\tType 1 diabetes\tContinuous motor unit activity/blink reflex hyperexcitability\tGAD\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml\tIVIG\n\nRituximab\n\n\t9\u00a0years\tNine months from HSCT:\n\nMarked clinical improvement (from walking 300 meters to 5 miles)\n\nNo further immunotherapy needed\n\nAnti-GAD and EMG remain positive\n\n\t\nD\t52/M\tPERM & Gluten ataxia\tPulmonary embolism\tBlink reflex hyperexcitability\tGAD 372 U/ml\n\nGlycine positive\n\nAnti-gliadin positive\n\n\tIVIG\n\nPlasmapheresis\n\n\t5\u00a0years\tThree years from HSCT:\n\nPartial clinical improvement (wheelchair to frame)\n\nNo further immunotherapy needed\n\nAnti-GAD, anti-glycine and anti-gliadin became negative\n\nBlink reflex normalised\n\n\t\nE\t44/M\tClassical SPS\tType 1 diabetes\n\nGluten sensitivity\n\n\tContinuous motor unit activity/blink reflex hyperexcitability\tGAD\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml\tIVIG\n\nPlasmapheresis\n\nMycophenolate\n\n\t7\u00a0years\tNot transplanted as condition stable on mycophenolate\t\nF\t70/F\tClassical SPS\tType 1 diabetes\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nCoeliac disease\n\nBronchiectasis with haemophilus colonisation and lobectomy.\n\n\tContinuous motor unit activity\tGAD\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml\tIVIG (not tolerated)\n\nAzathioprine\n\nMethotrexate\n\n\t20\u00a0years\tNot transplanted due to co-existing lung disease\t\nG\t47/M\tPERM\tRecurrent thrombosis of AV fistula.\tContinuous motor unit activity in paraspinal muscles\tGAD negative\n\nGlycine negative\n\n\tIVIG\n\nPlasmapheresis\n\nAzathioprine\n\nMycophenolate\n\n\t9\u00a0years\tNot transplanted\n\nFunding declined\n\n\t\nH\t53/F\tClassical SPS\tType 1 diabetes\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nGluten sensitivity\n\nPsoriatic arthropathy\n\nSacral abscess\n\nRecurrent sebaceous cysts\n\n\tContinuous motor unit activity/blink reflex hyperexcitability\tGAD\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml\n\nAnti-TPO 397\u00a0U/ml\n\n\tIVIG\t15\u00a0years\tNot transplanted\n\nFunding declined\n\nLater died from pneumonia (autopsy was not done)\n\n\t\nI\t35/F\tClassical SPS\tDeep venous thrombosis\n\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia\n\n\tContinuous motor unit activity\tGAD\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml\tIVIG\n\nPlasmapheresis\n\n\t2\u00a0years\tNot transplanted\n\nOngoing assessment\n\n\t\nJ\t48/F\tClassical SPS\t\u00a0None\tContinuous motor unit activity\tGAD\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml\tIVIG\n\nMycophenolate\n\n\t3\u00a0years\tNot transplanted\n\nOngoing assessment\n\n\t\nPERM Progressive Encephalomyelitis, Rigidity and Myoclonus, Auto-HSCT autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, GAD glutamic acid decarboxylase, EMG electromyography, IVIG intravenous Immunoglobulin\n\n\n\nPatients deemed suitable for auto-HSCT underwent detailed assessments including MRI of the brain and spine, nerve conduction studies, needle EMG to assess spontaneous motor unit activity and blink reflex study to assess brainstem hyperexcitability. Autoimmune screening included antinuclear, para-neoplastic, anti-GAD and anti-glycine antibodies as well as immunoglobulins and protein electrophoresis. Gluten sensitivity screening was undertaken including anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-TTG antibodies and anti-endomysial antibodies. This is because there is an overlap between anti-GAD associated disease and gluten sensitivity [9]. Infection screening included HIV, Hepatitis B & C, VZV, CMV, EBV, Toxoplasmosis and VDRL. Other baseline pre-transplant assessments included echocardiogram and pulmonary function tests.\n\nOf the 10 patients referred, one was found to be stable on mycophenolate and was declined transplant (patient E), and another was declined due to significant co-morbidities conferring an unacceptable risk (patient F). Eight patients were deemed suitable for auto-HSCT. Two patients did not proceed to transplant because funding requests were declined by their health authority (patient G and H). Patient H subsequently died from a chest infection. Two patients are currently being assessed (patient I and J).\n\nFour patients proceeded to auto-HSCT (patient A, B, C and D). Patient A, B and C had classical SPS. Patient D had the PERM variant of SPS.\n\nIn accordance with current auto-HSCT guidelines [10] patients received a standard regimen, with stem cell mobilisation consisting of cyclophosphamide 2\u00a0g/m2 and G-CSF followed by apheresis to achieve a minimum\u00a0CD34+ stem cell dose of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/kg. Auto-HSCT conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide 200\u00a0mg/kg (total dose, given as 50\u00a0mg/kg over days \u2212\u00a05 to \u2212\u00a02) with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, Thymoglobulin) total dose 6.0\u00a0mg/kg (given over days \u2212\u00a05 to \u2212\u00a02 as 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 1.5\u00a0mg/kg respectively with methylprednisolone cover) after which autologous peripheral blood stem cells were infused (on day 0). This is a non-myeloablative regimen which is similar to the one used by Dr Burt in Chicago for the treatment of this condition except that rituximab was not included in our regimen [11].\n\nData related to the duration of hospital stay, engraftment periods and complications of those who proceeded to auto-HSCT are summarised in Table\u00a02. All patients were followed every 6-9\u00a0months in a joint neurology and haematology clinic.Table\u00a02 Summary of data relating length of hospital stay, engraftment time and complications of autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) in the four patients treated for refractory stiff person syndrome\n\nPatient\tAge/Gender\tComplications during priming and harvesting \tEngraftment time after auto-HSCT (neutrophils\u2009>\u20090.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L and platelets\u2009>\u200920\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L)\tLength of hospital stay for auto-HSCT\tRequired blood products/ transfusions\tComplications during auto-HSCT\tLong term sequelae\t\nA\t36/F\tHeadache\n\nE.coli UTI\n\nPain\n\n\tNeutrophils:\n\n13\u00a0days\n\nPlatelets:\n\n12\u00a0days\n\n\t26\u00a0days\tYes\tEnterococcus UTI\n\nPulmonary embolism\n\nMucositis and rectal bleeding\n\nPost-menopausal symptoms\n\n\tAlive with no complications\t\nB\t48/F\tNone\tNeutrophils:\n\n11\u00a0days\n\nPlatelets:\n\nnever dropped below 50\n\n\t18\u00a0days\tNo\tESBL UTI\n\nTransient exacerbation of diabetes due to steroids\n\n\tAlive with no complications\t\nC\t37/F\tGram-negative pantoea agglomerans from Hickman line-treated successfully with antibiotics\tNeutrophils:\n\n14\u00a0days\n\nPlatelets:\n\n13\u00a0days\n\n\t21\u00a0days\tYes\tFebrile neutropenia covered with antibiotics\n\nTransiently deranged LFTs\n\nTransient CMV and EBV viraemia\n\n\tAlive with no complications\t\nD\t52/M\tNone\tNeutrophils:\n\n11\u00a0days\n\nPlatelets:\n\n10\u00a0days\n\n\t16\u00a0days\tYes\tCoagulase-negative staphylococcus line infection\n\nTransient EBV viraemia\n\nURTI (RSV)\n\n\tAlive with no complications\t\n\n\nTransplanted patients\nPatient A\n36-year-old female with no past medical history developed lower limbs and para-spinal muscle spasms that progressed over 3\u00a0months. Severe muscle spasms leading to arching of her back were triggered by sudden noise or cutaneous touch. Her symptoms continued to progress and she became wheelchair-bound 6\u00a0months later.\n\nMRI of the neuroaxis and CSF examination were normal. Anti-GAD antibodies were positive (>\u20092000 U/ml). She was diagnosed with the classical form of SPS. She responded partially to plasmapheresis at the referring centre but continued to require very frequent treatments and was therefore started on IVIG.\n\n\nWhen she was reviewed at our institution, she was severely disabled by her symptoms requiring regular IVIG treatments at a dose of 90\u00a0g every 12\u00a0days. She was taking regular diazepam at a dose of 30\u00a0mg per day and morphine up to 60\u00a0mg a day to control pain. On examination, she had brisk reflexes and severe clonus. She was exquisitely touch-sensitive which induced severe prolonged painful muscle spasms. The muscle spasms were severe enough to compromise her breathing and she required intermittent oxygen. EMG showed continuous muscle fibre activity. Blink reflex study was abnormal with marked amplification of the R2 component recorded following test stimulus in keeping with brainstem hyperexcitability (Fig.\u00a02A). Given her extreme stimulus sensitivity, she underwent EEG/EMG polygraphy recording which captured exaggerated startle response to auditory stimuli in keeping with brainstem hyperexcitability (Fig.\u00a01). The rest of her work-up and immunology screen were negative.Fig.\u00a01 EEG/EMG polygraphy recording of patient A with classical stiff-person syndrome capturing exaggerated startle response to an unanticipated auditory stimulus. Low intensity unanticipated auditory stimulus around 50\u00a0dB elicited prominent muscle jerks (within 92\u00a0ms from stimulus presentation) followed by protracted spasms in multiple muscle groups. Obc orbicularis Oculi, Obr orbicularis oris, Mass massetter, Stern sternocleidomastoid, Trap trapezius, Delt deltoid, UPA upper abdominals, TA tibialis anterior, STAR sensor marking the onset of the unanticipated auditory stimulus\n\n\n\nShe received auto-HSCT 8\u00a0years from the onset of her symptoms. Transplantation proceeded with no unexpected complications apart from routine toxicities (Table\u00a02).\n\nWhen reviewed 5\u00a0months after auto-HSCT, the majority of her neurological symptoms had improved significantly. She was ambulating independently and required no further IVIG but continued to take diazepam. She had mild startle responses. Anti-GAD antibodies remained positive at\u2009>\u20092000 U/ml.\n\nRepeat EMG undertaken a year post-auto-HSCT remained abnormal with continuous motor unit activity. Blink reflex study with short interstimulus intervals was not possible as immediately following the first electrical stimulus protracted contraction of facial muscle tended to emerge. Therefore, no meaningful comparison could be made with the previous study. Overall, the neurophysiological assessment continued to show features in keeping with SPS despite the clinical improvement.\n\nShe was reviewed again 2\u00a0years following auto-HSCT and was noted to have remained off all immunotherapy and was able to walk independently. She reported occasional muscle spasms affecting her arms and legs and poor exercise tolerance. Neurological examination was normal. She declined repeat neurophysiological assessment. Her anti-GAD antibodies remained positive.\n\nPatient B\nForty-eight-year-old female with a past medical history of type 1 diabetes, diabetic neuropathy and pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with intermittent muscle spasms affecting all four limbs. The spasms progressed gradually causing increasing difficulties with her mobility over a period of 4\u00a0years. At that point, she was mostly wheelchair-bound and only able to ambulate indoors with the help of a frame (supplementary electronic material). Painful muscle spasms were triggered by cutaneous touching. Prior to her referral to our institution she had been diagnosed with stiff person syndrome and was started on IVIG which helped her symptoms. However, she was requiring an infusion every 2\u00a0weeks. Subsequently, two doses of rituximab were given which improved her symptoms but did not reduce the need for regular IVIG. She was reliant on diazepam and baclofen for symptomatic relief.\n\nWhen reviewed at our institution she was noted to have intermittent sustained muscle spasms on examination. She also had clinical signs of length-dependent peripheral neuropathy which was confirmed on nerve conduction studies. EMG displayed continuous motor potential activity and blink reflex demonstrated brainstem hyper-excitability with lack of suppression of R2 component following the test stimulus (Fig.\u00a02Bi). Anti-GAD antibodies were positive (>\u20092000 U/ml) and the rest of her immunology screen was negative. Infection screening prior to auto-HSCT identified hepatitis B core antigen positivity. In the absence of any risk factors, this was thought to be caused by repeated IVIG infusions. Hepatitis B DNA PCR was negative.Fig.\u00a02 Blink reflex excitability studies at the short inter-stimulus interval between a conditioning and a test stimulus after 160\u00a0ms. Single square pulse electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve on one side is given at 20\u201325\u00a0mA and 0.2\u00a0s pulse width. The polysynaptic R2 response which is recorded following a test electrical stimulus from the contralateral side is typically supressed at such small interstimulus interval in healthy subjects. The least affected by artefact, rectified R2 waveform contralateral to the site of stimulation was used for analysis. In both patient A and patient B (classical stiff person syndrome) the contralateral R2 component that follows the test stimulus is enhanced (area estimates for R2 between cursors S1b/S1e and S2b/S2e are shown in the relevant embedded tables). The pre-HSCT study of patient A shows clear enhancement of the R2 response that follows the test stimulus in comparison to the earlier R2 waveform that followed the conditioning stimulus. For patient B, comparison between the pre-HSCT (Bi) and post-HSCT (Bii) examination shows relative normalisation of blink reflex excitability in the latter; the R2 area following the test stimulus is relatively suppressed in comparison to the R2 area of the conditioning stimulus (Bii). This electrophysiological assessment is used as a semiquantitative assessment of brainstem excitability\n\n\n\nAuto-HSCT was undertaken at our institution 4\u00a0years into her illness and progressed uneventfully (Table\u00a02). Hepatitis B DNA PCR was pre-emptively monitored throughout her immunosuppression and remained negative.\n\nWhen reviewed in clinic 6\u00a0months after auto-HSCT, her muscle spasms were noted to have improved significantly. She required no further doses of IVIG but continued to use a small dose of Baclofen. She was no longer requiring a wheelchair and started walking with the support of a stick. She continued to suffer from fatigue.\n\nRepeat EMG showed significant improvement with the patient being able to completely suppress all motor unit potential activity in muscles that were previously affected by severe stiffness. The blink reflex excitability studies also improved with a more suppressed R2 component following the test stimulus compared to the R2 component from the conditioning stimulus (Fig.\u00a02Bii). She was able to walk 10 meters in 15.2\u00a0s with a stick.\n\nSerologically, anti-GAD antibodies reduced from\u2009>\u20092000 to\u2009<\u20090.5 U/ml.\n\nA year after auto-HSCT her marked improvement continued. She was no longer reporting any spasms and was able to walk independently for long distances\u00a0(Electronic supplementary material). Her diabetes control also improved and she came off all her anti-diabetic treatments. She walked 10 meters in 9\u00a0s without assistance or stopping. A repeat EMG at that point showed no evidence of stiff person syndrome. Anti-GAD antibodies remained negative.\n\nPatient C\nThirty-seven-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes. She developed progressive painful muscle spasms affecting her core musculature and limbs, which were not controlled despite high doses of diazepam (30\u00a0mg/day) and gabapentin (2700\u00a0mg/day). Nine years into her symptoms she was able to walk unaided for a maximum of 300 meters. She struggled with social anxiety due to muscle spasms, which progressed to affect her face and jaw.\n\nPrior to her referral for auto-HSCT the patient had received five courses of IVIG, which provided transient benefit. She had three infusions of rituximab, which did not relieve her symptoms. Azathioprine was not tolerated.\n\nNeurological examination showed marked stiffness of her abdominal and para-spinal muscles. EMG showed continued motor activity in the para-spinal muscles. Blink reflex study showed evidence of brainstem hyperexcitability. Anti-GAD antibodies were positive (>\u20092000 U/ml). The rest of the immunology, paraneoplastic and infective screens were negative. Auto-HSCT was offered 9\u00a0years after symptom onset. There were no major complications from auto-HSCT apart from routine toxicities (Table\u00a02).\n\nNine months after transplantation the patient reported marked improvement of the severity of her muscle spasms and stiffness. She reported mild fatigue but she was able to walk for up to 5 miles a day. She continued to use diazepam and gabapentin albeit at much lower doses (10\u00a0mg of Diazepam/day and 500\u00a0mg of Gabapentin/day). Blink reflex study did not show evidence of brainstem hyperexcitability however, limited lumbar paraspinals EMG (patient was needle phobic) showed continued motor potentials. Anti-GAD antibodies remained positive after transplantation.\n\nPatient D\n52-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented with progressive asymmetrical muscle stiffness affecting initially the right leg but subsequently other parts of his body. The stiffness progressed over 5\u00a0years to involve all four limbs, which significantly impaired his ability to carry out the activities of daily living. Facial muscles involvement interfered with speech and swallowing and he occasionally bit his tongue.\n\nExamination revealed marked muscle rigidity, brisk reflexes and clonus. MRI of the spine showed moderate spondylosis which did not account for the patient\u2019s symptoms. Serological testing for gluten sensitivity revealed positive anti-gliadin antibodies and a gluten-free diet was adopted. MRI of the brain showed mild atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres. MRI spectroscopy demonstrated low NAA/Creatine ratio of 0.85 from the superior vermis (normal over 1.00) (Fig.\u00a03). CSF examination was normal.Fig.\u00a03 MRI spectroscopy of 52-year-old male with stiff person synonym (PERM - patient D) who underwent autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). The MRI demonstrate cerebellar involvement showing NAA/creatine ratio of 0.85 from the superior vermis (normal above 1.00) before auto-HSCT which improved to 0.93 after auto-HSCT\n\n\n\nNerve conduction studies were normal. EMG did not show continuous motor unit activity however, blink reflex studies showed evidence of hyper-excitability. Anti-GAD antibodies were positive at 372 U/ml. Anti-glycine antibodies were positive. Paraneoplastic, anti-NMDA and anti-VGKC antibodies were negative.\n\nHe was diagnosed with the PERM variant of SPS on the basis of the clinical features and the serology results. He was started on IVIG which resulted in partial clinical improvement. However, he continued to require infusions at a dose of 150\u00a0g every 3\u00a0months. He could not tolerate Diazepam, Baclofen, Tizanidine or Dantrolene. He did not tolerate mycophenolate which he tried for 2\u00a0months. Over the subsequent years, he became wheelchair-bound and dependent on IVIG which he continued for a year.\n\nAuto-HSCT was offered 5\u00a0years after symptom onset. While he was being considered for auto-HSCT he developed deep vein thrombosis and a large saddle pulmonary embolism thought to be related to poor mobility and regular IVIGs. He was started on rivaroxaban. Auto-HSCT proceeded uneventfully apart from routine toxicities (Table\u00a02).\n\nFour months after auto-HSCT, his mobility improved from wheelchair to a frame. His legs remained stiff but arms improved significantly so he was able to feed and wash himself. Anti-GAD and anti-glycine antibodies became negative. Repeat blink reflex study post-transplantation showed no evidence of hyperexcitability. He was no longer requiring regular IVIG. His speech remained dysarthric but his swallowing normalised. He was no longer biting his tongue. He stopped all regular medications.\n\nTwo years after auto-HSCT he remained off IVIG and had good use of his upper limbs but continued to use a walking frame. EMG and blink reflex studies remained normal and anti-GAD was negative. MRI spectroscopy of the cerebellum showed improvement of his NAA/creatine ratio (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nDiscussion\nWe report our experience in using auto-HSCT to treat four patients with refractory SPS.\n\nAll four patients experienced marked improvement in their symptoms and mobility following treatment. In spite of clinical improvement, patient A and C (classical SPS) continued to have high circulating anti-GAD antibody titre. EMG and blink reflex excitability assessment remained abnormal in patient A but normalised in patient C. On the other hand, patient B (classical SPS) and patient D (PERM) became seronegative for circulating antibodies and their EMG and blink reflex studies normalised. Furthermore, MRI spectroscopy values in patient D improved following treatment.\n\nSignificantly, with respect to both clinical impact and health resource utilisation all our patients stopped regular IVIG and other forms of immunotherapy with sustained symptomatic and clinical improvement.\n\nThe response to auto-HSCT confirms the autoimmune basis of SPS. Continued seropositivity for anti-GAD in half of our patients is comparable to the previous two case reports of using auto-HSCT to treat SPS [8].\n\nThe role of anti-GAD in the pathogenesis of SPS remains uncertain. GAD is the rate-limiting step in the decarboxylation of L-glutamate to \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Thus, anti-GAD antibodies are postulated to lead to decreased levels of GABA in the brainstem and spinal cord resulting in dis-inhibition and hyper-excitability [12]. However, several observations question anti-GAD pathogenicity in SPS. These include lack of correlation of antibody titres and disease severity [13], absence of anti-GAD antibodies in some SPS patients [14] and reports of clinical improvement with ongoing high circulating antibodies [8].\n\nInterestingly patient B who became anti-GAD negative after auto-HSCT also reported improvement of her diabetic control. Thus, anti-GAD may support the diagnosis of SPS and other autoimmune dysfunction but does not fully explain the pathophysiology.\n\nGlycine receptors are inhibitory receptors found on the neuronal cell surface predominantly in the brainstem and spinal cord. They exert their effects through chloride current resulting in membrane hyperpolarisation and reduction in excitation [15]. Antibodies against the alpha-1 subunit of glycine receptors are, therefore, associated with hyperexcitability. Null mutations in glycine receptors result in hereditary hyperekplexia characterised by an excessive startle and often muscle rigidity [16].\n\nWhen anti-glycine receptor antibodies are present, they are typically associated with the PERM variant of SPS [5]. However, anti-glycine receptors antibodies are also found in around 15% of patient with classical SPS patients with uncertain significance [17]. Furthermore, glycine receptor antibodies have been reported to occur in other autoimmune conditions with heterogeneous phenotypes including ataxia, limbic encephalitis and myoclonic epilepsy [16].\n\nThe pathogenic roles of B cell and T cell immunity in SPS are similarly not well defined. Intrathecal production of oligoclonal anti-GAD IgG antibodies is continued by active B cells with the help of T cells that are activated by neural antigens [18]. Thus, immuno-ablative therapy to eliminate the dysfunctional immune response is expected to offer benefit. Immuno-ablative chemotherapy is followed by the re-introduction of autologous stem cell graft aiming to restart a new self-tolerant immune system. The CSF was not assayed for the presence of anti-GAD antibodies in our patients, but this should be considered in future studies to assess whether this parameter would correlate with treatment response.\n\nAt the time of writing of this case series all our transplanted patients manifested sustained clinical improvement without the need for any form of immunotherapy. Follow-up post-transplant has ranged from 12\u00a0months to 3\u00a0years. No patient encountered major or unexpected complications. Longer-term benefit of auto-HSCT in SPS remains to be ascertained.\n\nAutologous HSCT has shown promise as a treatment option for a range of treatment-refractory autoimmune neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, myasthenia gravis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [10, 19]. Our experience further supports its use for refractory stiff-person syndrome. Auto-HSCT may prove to be a more cost-effective treatment in patients requiring regular treatment with expensive modalities, such as IVIG. Further work is warranted to establish long-term safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of auto-HSCT in SPS, along with optimising patient selection and transplant technique. This calls for collaboration between centres that provide this service.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.Supplementary material 1 (MP4 82628 kb)\n\n Supplementary material 2 (MP4 5421 kb)\n\n \n\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge the support of the\u00a0NIHR Sheffield biomedical research centre and clinical trial unit.\n\nAuthor contributions\nLKI assessed patients, collected data, drafted and revised the first manuscript.

Typical extra-cutaneous lesions have the appearance of blueish nipple-shaped nodules that can easily compress and refill. We described a rare case of a 23-year-old female with BRBNS and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) that presented with central nervous system (CNS) involvement including unprovoked focal impaired awareness seizure. Her BRBNS presents with hemangiomas involving multiple organs in the body including the brain, gastrointestinal (GI) system, and skin. This case highlights the importance of studying and understanding the association between BRBNS and TSC as it may lead to improved understanding.\n\nTEXT:\nFirst described in 1860, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) is a disorder characterized by multiple dome-shaped cutaneous venous malformations on the skin and visceral organs.1 The BRBNS is an extremely rare disorder with only approximately 200 cases being reported since the term was coined.1 Typical extra-cutaneous lesions have the appearance of blueish nipple-shaped nodules that can easily compress and refill.2 These lesions frequently affect the gastrointestinal (GI) system and cause hemorrhage, iron-deficiency anemia, intussusception, and volvulus.3 In addition to GI involvement, these lesions have been shown to affect the central nervous system and may cause fatal hemorrhage.2 Herein, we report a case of BRBNS in a patient with TSC and CNS involvement that resulted in focal impaired awareness seizures.\n\nCase Report\n\nPatient information and clinical findings\n\nA 23-year-old female presented to the clinic with a history of focal impaired awareness seizure. She is a known case of tuberous sclerosis (confirmed by genetic testing and evident on MRI brain) and BRBNS, which the patient was diagnosed with early in childhood. Her BRBNS presents with hemangiomas involving multiple organs in the body including the brain, GI system, and skin.\n\nDiagnostic assessment and therapeutic intervention\n\nEarlier in her diagnosis, she was managed with various modalities, such as chemotherapy and interventional radiology, which failed to control her disease and specifically her active GI bleeding. To treat her subsequent iron-deficiency anemia, she was transfused on a weekly basis. Owing to her progressive uncontrolled disease, she traveled to seek further treatment at medical centers in the United States, where her disease was controlled by surgical resection and interventional sclerotherapy. The patient returned to Saudi Arabia and was later commenced on sirolimus, which she showed some response to. In 2016, the patient started developing multiple new lesions on her neck and trunk. Later, she started presenting complaints that are consistent with focal aware seizures. These attacks are characterized by loss of memory over a couple of minutes that is slowly regained in the proceeding 30 min. The patient reports feeling fear that lasts seconds to minutes preceding the seizure. It has been reported that her first attack happened when she was 2 years old. It occurred daily at any time during the day or night. After 9 years of age, it became less frequent and occurred once per week in the form of staring and behavioral arrest with mouth automatism lasting less than 10 seconds. At that time, she had been started initially on ethosuximide and valproic acid. After her 20th birthday, the semiology changed to focal impaired awareness seizure presenting in the form of palpitations and fear followed by behavioral arrest lasting less than 30 seconds. Carbamazepine was effective at that time in controlling her seizures as a mono-therapy. Alas, at the age of 23 years, the seizure recurred. At that time, the immunosuppressant for her dermatological case, sirolimus, was commenced and had interacted with the carbamazepine she was on. Therefore, levetiracetam (LEV) was added and was later reported to have aggravated her anxiety symptoms. Our patient was then shifted to lamotrigine (LTG) due to the psychiatric side effects she developed from LEV including anxiety and depression, which has successfully kept her seizure free during her 6-months follow up.\n\nFollow-Up and outcomes\n\nUpon examining the patient, she had small, dark blue, round or ellipsoid, soft compressible nevi (20-mm diameter) on her face, abdomen, and back. Her physical exam and vital signs were otherwise within normal limits. Upon further investigation, a 30-min EEG study performed was found to be normal with rhythmic mid-temporal theta bursts of drowsiness (RMTD), a benign variant also known as the psychomotor variant. Video-EEG or continuous EEG to ensure the absence of seizures is yet to be performed. Multisequential multiplanar nonenhanced and enhanced MRIs of the head and neck were performed showing extensive scalp, neck, chest wall as well as para-spinal soft tissue mass lesions involving also deep regions like the deep neck and chest, posterior deep cervical, oral, around the thyroid and para-tracheal regions. Additionally, the radiological findings showed a similar soft tissue lesion in the right oropharynx causing narrowing. The overall appearance was described as suggestive of extensive multiple vascular malformations in keeping with the known diagnosis of Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome. Other MRI findings have shown to be consistent with Tuberous Sclerosis of multiple bilateral cortical/subcortical tubers involving bilateral frontal, parietal as well as left temporal lobes with ill-defined gray-white matter junction and cortical thickening.\n\nFigure 1 - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1 of head and neck sagittal section showing extensive vascular hemangioma of the posterior neck.\n\nFigure 2 - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1 of head and neck transverse section showing extensive para-spinal soft tissue mass lesions.\n\nFigure 3 - Post-contrast coronal MR of the head and neck shows extensive scalp, neck, upper chest and posterior para-spinal lobulated T2 hyper-intense soft tissue mass lesions suggestive of soft tissue venous malformation.\n\nFigure 4 - Axial FLAIR of the brain demonstrates multiple bilateral cortical/subcortical tubers involving bilateral frontal parietal as well as left temporal lobes with ill-defined gray-white matter junction and cortical thickening.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe BRBNS with CNS involvement is rare and has been seldom reported. Some of the diagnoses in the reported cases were not clear. To date, 6 cases have been described including the case that has been thoroughly documented by Waybright et al.2 In 1978, Waybright et\u00a0al. have described a BRBNS patient who presented with focal seizures and lateralized neurologic signs. The possible neurologic outcomes of BRBNS can present in multiple ways depending on the size and location of the cerebral angiomas.5 Owing to the heterogeneity of CNS manifestations and the risk of developing angioma thrombosis, it is typically challenging to evaluate the prognosis of the disease. Thus, it is essential for patients to undergo strict monitoring and thorough neurologic evaluation.5 However, to date, there have been no documented cases of BRBNS associated with TSC and subsequent CNS involvement. The patient in this study had multiple cutaneous venous malformations, bilateral cortical/ subcortical tubers, slight prominence of the ventricular system without evidence of acute hydrocephalus, and multiple hemangiomas in the brain, scalp, oropharynx, and chest. The diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of typical skin lesions and other clinical findings. For GI lesions, angiography, endoscopy, and MRI are favorable for diagnosis. In cases of CNS involvement, further imaging studies (e.g.,\u00a0CT and MRI) have been described as useful noninvasive tools. In addition, MRI has been described as a useful tool for screening asymptomatic patients.2 Typically, the treatment is symptom- and patient-based. This includes modalities to manage the bleeding and transfusion therapy. A combined laser-steroid therapy for GI hemangiomas has been reported by some investigators. The BRBNS cases are mostly sporadic in nature; familial cases have been recently associated with somatic mutations in TEK, the gene encoding TIE2, the endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptor for the angiopoietins. These cases appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The TIE/angiopoietin family are closely implicated in and responsible for processes driving angiogenesis, be it in the physiological or in the pathological setting. The TIE2 activation integrates several intracellular signaling pathways, including the phosphati-dylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway promoting endothelial cell survival. PI3K in turn stimulates downstream regulation of mTOR.3 Similarly, TSC1/2 complex, the tumor suppressor genes responsible for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, stimulates upstream activation signals from growth factor receptors via the pathway of (PI3K)/AKT. The mechanisms by which the TSC1/2 complex is regulated and in turn controls mTOR activity are merely beginning to be unraveled.4 Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal genetic disorder characterized by the development of several benign tumors in the body. Vascular malformations or abnormalities in the setting of TSC are well-described in scientific literature. Angiomyolipomas are most commonly described, followed by arterial malformations, which are considerably less common. According to previous publications, most patients with TSC develop epilepsy, and most develop multiple seizure types. It has been reported that the most frequent seizure types in TSC are focal seizures and focal spasms.7 In the current case, our patient first presented with seizures at the age of 2 years. Her most recent seizures presented as focal impaired awareness seizures described as loss of memory over a couple of minutes that is preceded by feeling of fear lasting between seconds to minutes. Typically, seizure onset occurs in the first year of life, yet adults remain at risk. Because TSC-associated epilepsy usually presents early in life, seizure semiology often reflects the locations of cortical tubers and can potentially affect functional maturation.3 Focal seizures or infantile spasms frequently present in TSC patients with early onset epilepsy.7 In regards to the fact that drug-resistant epilepsy in TSC is common, many patients achieve full seizure control despite the presence of lesions in the brain.6 Studies conducted show that focal rhythmic slow wave activity, predominant on the temporal region without diffusion, was the typical reported pattern in TSC patients presenting with focal epilepsy.7 In the contrary, our patient presented with a normal 30-minute EEG study displaying rhythmic mid-temporal theta bursts of drowsiness (RMTD). RMTDs are generally considered benign variants with uncertain significance; however, concerns have been raised for their ictal potential.8 They were later confirmed to be the least epileptogenic of temporal discharges.8 However, generalized spike and wave discharges may be completely absent during wakefulness in some patients, making routine EEG studies yield a low sensitivity for identifying interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). It is safe to say that long-term video-EEG monitoring is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis, classification and localization of epileptic seizures.9 A study by X. Liu et al10 concluded that the first-hour sleep EEG is able to reliably predict the occurrence of IEDs during long-term video-EEG recording and can be utilized as a time-efficient method to identify patients with IEDs, mitigating the burden in the adult epilepsy monitoring unit. Guidelines suggest that antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are indicated as the first treatment option and shall follow those of other epilepsies.4 The presence of BRBNS in the setting of TSC has never been documented before. Moreover, it is unclear whether the patient\u2019s epileptiform activity is a result of her BRBNS manifesting with cerebral hemangiomas or TSC cortical tubers, yet it has been evident that compliance with the selected mono-therapeutic antiepileptic medication has been beneficial in seizure control. Nevertheless, our study is limited by a number of factors including its retrospective and single case nature, the atypical presentation of TSC and the absence of a long-term video-EEG recording. Additional genetic mutations or complex pathways may be involved and require further characterization. Despite the limitations, the present case highlights the importance of studying the associations between BRBNS and TSC as it may lead to improved understanding of combined pathways and the further development of preferable management plans for patients.\n\nFigure 5 - 30-Minute EEG results showing rhythmic midtemporal theta bursts of drowsiness.\n\nFigure 6 - Case report timeline.\n\nIn conclusion, our patient diagnosed with BRBNS and TSC in her childhood demonstrated a rare presentation of focal impaired awareness seizure. Her BRBNS presents with hemangiomas involving multiple organs in the body including the brain, GI system and skin. We report this case to illustrate the importance of studying and understanding the association between these two diseases as it may lead to improved understanding of combined pathways.\n\nPatient\u2019s perspective\n\nThe patient reports that she feels relieved to have her seizures in control. Moreover, she is glad that the previous psychiatric side effects including anxiety and depression have remitted after the drug switch to lamotrigine. She reports noticing major improvement in her quality of daily life.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nWe would like to sincerely thank Dr. Khalid Omar Alahmadi, for his review of the radiology images.

We herein report the first case of tocilizumab-induced lupus syndrome presenting with cardiac tamponade. A 65-year-old man presented with cough, exertional dyspnea, and chest pain after 2 months of tocilizumab therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Echocardiography revealed marked pericardial effusion. Antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies were positive. The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade due to tocilizumab-induced lupus syndrome was made. He had no recurrence of pericardial effusion after tocilizumab discontinuation. Clinicians should be alert for lupus syndrome in patients receiving tocilizumab.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nTocilizumab is a humanized murine monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor. It binds to and prevents the action of IL-6 receptors present in the serum and joint fluid as well as membrane-bound IL-6 receptors on the surface of macrophages, B- and T-lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, leading to the suppression of various immunological functions (1). Tocilizumab is mainly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It has also been investigated as a treatment for other conditions, such as Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and refractory adult-onset Still's disease (2-9).\n\nDrug-induced lupus (DIL) is a rare drug reaction presenting with the same symptoms as that of idiopathic lupus erythematosus. With the introduction of new drugs in clinical practice, an increase in the number of drug-induced illnesses has been reported. Reports implicating tocilizumab as a cause of cardiac tamponade are scarce in the literature.\n\nFurthermore, there have been no reports on tocilizumab-induced lupus syndrome.\n\nWe herein report a 65-year-old patient who developed cardiac tamponade associated with DIL during tocilizumab treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of tocilizumab-induced lupus syndrome presenting with cardiac tamponade.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 65-year-old man with RA was started on tocilizumab. He presented with stiffness of both hands and had been diagnosed with RA at 64 years of age. He was treated with methotrexate (MTX) and a low dose of prednisolone (PSL). However, stiffness of both hands persisted. At 65 years of age, the subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab every 2 weeks was added. After two months of therapy, he presented to the emergency department with exertional dyspnea and chest pain. The patient also reported a cough that had started after the initiation of tocilizumab therapy. His medical history included effort angina. There was no family history of autoimmune disease. His regular medications included celecoxib, MTX, foliamine, rosuvastatin, prasugrel, esomeprazole, nicorandil, and isosorbide mononitrate.\n\nAt the presentation, his blood pressure was 129/93 mmHg, pulse was 108/min, respiratory rate was 28/min with an O2 saturation of 95% on room air, and body temperature was 37.9\u2103. He was orthopneic at rest, and his lungs were clear on auscultation. His jugular venous pressure was elevated, and heart sounds were normal with no murmurs. He presented with a painful oral ulcer. There was no evidence of skin rash, rheumatoid nodules, or arthralgia. On admission, initial investigations revealed leukocytosis (white cell count 14,900/\u03bcL, neutrophils 87.1%, lymphocytes 5.2%, monocytes 7.4%, eosinophils 0%, basophils 0.3%), hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 355,000/\u03bcL. His renal function, electrolytes, cardiac enzymes, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were normal. However, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 15.71 mg/dL) and liver function test results (albumin 3.6 g/dL, bilirubin 2.7 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 162 IU/L, alanine transaminase 113 IU/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 379 IU/L) were found to be abnormal (Table).\n\nTable.

An electrocardiogram revealed PR elevation in aVR and an abnormal Q wave in leads V1-2. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed marked pericardial effusion and collapse of the right atrium and ventricle (Fig. 3). The patient was thus diagnosed with cardiac tamponade.\n\nFigure 1.

Culture of the pericardial effusion was negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal infections. There was no evidence of malignancy. A dominant increase in virus antibodies was absent on a blood test. Connective tissue disease workup showed positivity for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) with a titer of 1:160, and the anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody (anti-dsDNA) titer was elevated at 37.2 U/mL. Regarding complement (C) levels, the C3 level was low at 64 mg/dL, the C4 level was low at 8 mg/dL, and the CH50 level was less than 10 mg/dL.\n\nHis clinical and laboratory manifestations [serositis (pericarditis and pleuritic), ANA positivity, hypocomplementemia, and anti-dsDNA antibody positivity] were considered to fulfill the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (10).\n\nWe discontinued tocilizumab and prescribed colchicine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on admission. He was only treated with MTX for RA. He had no recurrence of pericardial effusion in the next 12 months, and the serum levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies gradually decreased (Fig. 4).\n\nFigure 4.

It usually presents after months or years of continuous exposure to an offending drug (11). Numerous medications have been implicated in the development of DIL. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 therapy is a treatments for RA and has recently been reported to induce DIL, thus spurring several discussions concerning the mechanism underlying DIL. Tocilizumab is an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody. Both anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies and anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs are used as RA treatments. There have been no reported cases of anti-IL-6 therapy-associated DIL, although several cases of anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy-associated DIL have been reported. The common clinical presentations of DIL include arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, a fever, and weight loss. Pericardial effusion due to DIL is relatively uncommon.\n\nOzaki et al. reported a case of cardiac pericarditis as an adverse effect of tocilizumab (12). This case was negative for antinuclear antibodies and was not diagnosed as DIL. In addition, they concluded that the pericardial effusion associated with RA had increased rapidly before tocilizumab could prove its efficacy, suggesting it might not be an adverse effect of tocilizumab.\n\nIn our case, the patient had severe pericardial effusion, and anti-dsDNA antibody titers were elevated during tocilizumab therapy. Therefore, we decided to stop administering the drug, after which the patient's titer gradually decreased to normal without additional treatment for RA. Regarding the effusion, we performed pericardiocentesis and drained 900 ml of fluid; no re-effusion was recognized in the next 12 months. These findings confirmed our diagnosis of tocilizumab-induced lupus.\n\nHis clinical and laboratory manifestations [serositis (pericarditis and pleuritic), RF, and hypocomplementemia] were also considered to meet the criteria for rheumatoid vasculitis. The pericardial effusion might have been a result of malignant RA. However, the patient had a short duration of RA, and RA had progressed without exacerbation after tocilizumab treatment. In addition, when we stopped administrating tocilizumab, pericarditis did not recur. The development of SLE secondary to tocilizumab therapy has not yet been reported. We believe that anti-dsDNA antibodies might have triggered lupus in this case. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are typically absent in DIL; however, they can sometimes be found in interferon (IFN)-\u03b1- and anti-TNF-\u03b1-induced lupus (13,14). A few mechanisms have been proposed concerning the development of SLE during anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy (15). The mechanism involved in the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies is that systemic inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 might interfere with apoptosis, affecting the clearance of nuclear debris and apoptotic neutrophils by phagocytes, thus promoting the production of autoantibodies to DNA and other nuclear antigens (14,16,17).\n\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate that type I IFN, especially IFN-\u03b1, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of SLE (18). After tocilizumab administration in patients with RA and Castleman disease, IL-6 receptors are saturated with tocilizumab, and IL-6 signaling is completely inhibited, but the serum levels of both IL-6 and IL-6 receptor are markedly increased; this suggests that various cytokines, including IFNs, might also be upregulated under tocilizumab treatment (19). We hypothesized that this mechanism may be responsible for the development of SLE during tocilizumab treatment.\n\nWe herein report the first case of tocilizumab-induced lupus with cardiac tamponade. Clinicians should be alert for lupus syndrome, which can present with medical emergencies, such as cardiac tamponade, in patients receiving tocilizumab.\n\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).",

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nAcute Ileal Perforation Caused by Radiation Enteritis After Restoration.\n\nABSTRACT:\nFew radiation-induced bowel perforations have been reported to date. Furthermore, perforation after ileal restoration in asymptomatic patients is rare. We report the case of a 61-year-old man who was administered preoperative chemoradiotherapy for advanced rectal cancer. The patient underwent ultra-low anterior resection with ileal diversion, followed by ileal restoration. Perforation was detected 9 days after restoration, and he underwent a right hemicolectomy. The histologic evaluation indicated ileal perforation caused by acute radiation enteritis.\n\nTEXT:\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) combined with total mesorectal excision has become a well-established approach for the reduction of local recurrence following the treatment of advanced rectal cancer [1]. As many rectal cancer patients undergo preoperative CRT, the complications associated with radiation should not be overlooked. Gastrointestinal symptoms following radiotherapy can be caused by intestinal strictures, intestinal fistula, de novo or recurrent neoplasia, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, bile salt malabsorption, fat or carbohydrate malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic insufficiency, or irritable bowel syndrome, presenting with variable degrees [2]. In addition, rare cases of perforation, which can lead to generalized peritonitis and sometimes mortality, have been reported [3].\n\nHerein, we report a rare complication of radiation enteritis, namely ileal perforation, after ileal restoration in a patient who underwent preoperative CRT.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea (No. 2020-0846). Written informed consent was obtained for publication of this case report and accompanying images.\n\nA 61-year-old man visited the hospital with pathologically confirmed rectal cancer 3 cm from the anal margin, identified using colonoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a tumor with perirectal fat infiltration. Preoperative CRT with capecitabine was administered at a cumulative dose of 5,040 cGY, divided into 28 cycles. Following preoperative CRT, sigmoidoscopy revealed the mass size to have decreased. MRI scan also revealed a decrease in the mass size, and the residual lesion contained more fibrous than tumor tissue. In addition, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse wall thickening in a distal ileal segment located in the pelvis, indicating probable radiation enteritis (Fig. 1A). Eight weeks after the completion of preoperative CRT, the patient underwent robot-assisted ultra-low anterior resection with ileal diversion. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 7 days after the surgery. Postoperative histologic staging was ypT3N0, and 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine were administered thereafter.\n\nThe patient was admitted again for ileal restoration 6 months after the operation. A small incision for ileal restoration did not permit accurate evaluation of the stricture and wall thickening or perfusion along the entire ileum. Functional end-to-end anastomosis was performed using a linear cutting stapler. Two days after the surgery, the patient\u2019s progress was unremarkable, other than several episodes of diarrhea. However, 5 days after the surgery, a sudden episode of fever (38.7\u00b0C) developed, along with abdominal distension and mild tenderness. CT images suggested segmental diffuse edema in the terminal ileum, resulting in small bowel stricture and some uncomplicated reactive ascites. Although the patient was treated conservatively with fasting and antibiotics, the fever did not subside, and the abdominal distension and tenderness worsened. Percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) was performed 8 days after the surgery; 550 mL of fluid was drained, which was clear and serous. After drainage, the patient\u2019s distension and tenderness showed some improvement. However, 9 days after surgery, the patient exhibited aggravated symptoms, and the PCD appeared green in color and turbid in nature. In addition, an erect simple abdominal radiograph confirmed the presence of free air. CT images suggested peritonitis associated with bowel perforation, including free air, ascites, peritoneal infiltration, and thickening with enhancement (Fig. 1B, C). There was also a persistence of the previously noted diffuse segmental mural thickening in the distal ileum (i.e., presumed radiation enteritis), causing small bowel stricture with proximal dilatation (Fig. 1B, C).\n\nConsidering the CT findings and the nature of the drainage fluid, emergency surgery was planned. Surgical findings showed that the previous anastomosis was intact, and a pinpoint perforation was confirmed on the sidewall of the anastomosis (Fig. 2A). As the perforation site was identified at some distance from the PCD, the possibility of iatrogenic perforation following PCD insertion was less likely. A stricture, caused by radiation enteritis, was detected 10 cm in length in the distal bowel segment 5 cm above the crotch of restoration anastomosis. A limited right hemicolectomy with ileal resection (length, 42 cm), including the previous stomal restoration site, was subsequently performed.\n\nPostoperative histology revealed the perforation site with a transmural tissue defect and acute fibrinous inflammation (Fig. 2B). In addition, the affected mucosa showed marked crypt dissipation, stromal hyalinization, and telangiectasia (Fig. 2C, D). Taken together, these pathologic features are consistent with perforated severe radiation enteritis. Subsequent culture of the ascites fluid confirmed enteric aerobic and anaerobic microbes; however, the clostridium difficile toxin assay was negative. The patient was discharged without the occurrence of any subsequent events other than a few episodes of diarrhea 11 days after surgery.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nGastrointestinal adverse events following radiation therapy can occur when gastrointestinal structures are included in the radiation field. The incidence and severity of radiation enteritis depend on the dose of radiotherapy. Additional aggravating factors include age, presence of comorbidities, prior operation, tobacco abuse, and concurrent chemotherapy [3]. Enteral epithelium is affected by chemotherapy as well as radiation because of its highly proliferative potential [4]. Mucosal atrophy with atypical hyperplastic glands and intestinal wall fibrosis, and telangiectasias can be typical histologic changes [5]. Otherwise, mucosal ulceration can also occur, sometimes developing abscess, fistula, and perforation. Fibrosis occurs as part of the healing process of the ulcer, which unfortunately produces narrowing of the enteral lumen causing stricture and even obstruction [5]. The patient did not have any comorbidities and history of surgery except for rectal cancer operation. He had a 30-pack-year smoking history, but quit smoking approximately a year before the rectal cancer diagnosis. Considering the pathogenesis of the patient, stricture caused by radiation enteritis led to obstruction and small bowel bacterial overgrowth caused by stasis, leading to stercoral enteritis and perforation caused by high pressure.\n\nIn general, the complication of radiation can be divided into acute and late, depending on the timing. Late complication is less frequent than acute complication, but it can occur in up to 40% of patients receiving radiation in the abdominopelvic area three to 6 years after radiation [3]. Complications can be graded from 0 to 5 according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group morbidity grading scale [3]. Depending on the severity, there are various clinical features such as enteritis, bleeding, narrowing, perforation, fistula, etc. Enteral perforation is a very uncommon complication compared with bleeding and obstruction [6].\n\nDiagnosis should be based on a combination of the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, history, laboratory result, imaging finding, and physical examination. The possibility of recurrent neoplasia should not be ruled out during diagnostic workup [7]. Management of chronic radiation enteritis is primarily focused on symptomatic improvement. Additionally, nutritional support should not be omitted. Symptomatic treatments include antidiarrheal agents, antiinflammatories, probiotics and antibiotics, cholestyramine, pentoxifylline and tocopherol, and hyperbaric oxygen, based on the individual status [2]. If the response to medical treatment does not meet the expectations, endoscopic therapy, including coagulation therapy and balloon dilatation, and further surgery needs to be considered [2].\n\nThis report describes a rare case of ileal perforation caused by intractable radiation enteritis after ileal restoration. In conclusion, when radiation enteritis continues to be intractable, concurrent with relevant physical, laboratory, and abdominopelvic CT findings, timely surgical intervention needs to be considered, or an irradiated bowel resection should be performed during ileal restoration.\n\nFig. 1.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nBotulinum Neurotoxin Injections in Childhood Opisthotonus.\n\nABSTRACT:\nOpisthotonus refers to abnormal axial extension and arching of the trunk produced by excessive contractions of the paraspinal muscles. In childhood, the abnormal posture is most often related to dystonia in the setting of hypoxic injury or a number of other acquired and genetic etiologies. The condition is often painful, interferes with ambulation and quality of life, and is challenging to treat. Therapeutic options include oral benzodiazepines, oral and intrathecal baclofen, botulinum neurotoxin injections, and deep brain stimulation. Management of opisthotonus within the pediatric population has not been systematically reviewed. Here, we describe a series of seven children who presented to our institution with opisthotonus in whom symptom relief was achieved following administration of botulinum neurotoxin injections.\n\nTEXT:\n1. Introduction\n\nOpisthotonus, derived from the Greek \u201copistho\u201d meaning behind and \u201ctonos\u201d meaning tone, was described by Nayler in 1803 within the context of tetanus as \u201csuch rigid contractions of those of the back, as to draw his head forcibly backwards at the same that his chest was considerably elevated\u201d and described his expression as \u201cbearing the strongest possible marks of the agony he suffered\u201d [1]. Later, it was described by Charcot in 1887 as \u201carc de cercle\u201d, or arching of the body such that the patient is suspended above the bed by the head and the heels [2]. Charcot\u2019s description of abnormal posture was in the context of hysteroepileptic spells, later classified as psychogenic or functional dystonia [3,4]. Opisthotonus involves forceful axial extension of the trunk and also neck (retrocollis), caused by involuntary contractions of the paraspinal muscles, often associated with dystonic posturing of arms and legs (Figure 1) [5]. Although most frequently attributed to dystonia, there are many causes of opisthotonus that have been identified (Table 1). While in adults, the most common cause of opisthotonus is tardive dystonia [6], typically associated with adduction of the shoulders and extension/pronation of the arms, the most common causes of childhood opisthotonus are perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury, and genetic/metabolic disorders which often present as a cerebral palsy phenotype [5].\n\nOpisthotonus represents one of several abnormal axial skeletal abnormalities en-countered in adult and pediatric populations, also including camptocormia, scoliosis, and other postural abnormalities [7,8]. It can be persistent and severe, occurring in-termittently or for sustained periods throughout the day, and when it presents as such, it is incompatible with living comfortably at home. If left untreated, many patients with these axial abnormalities develop contractures, fixed deformities due to shorten-ing of muscles and tendons. In some cases of dystonic opisthotonus, the intense con-tractions of the paraspinal muscles can lead to dystonic storm (also known as status dystonicus) [9,10]. This potentially fatal condition is characterized by persistent, worsening dystonia associated with interference with sleep as well at least one meta-bolic disturbance: (1) fever not due to infectious etiology, (2) abnormal electrolytes, (3) elevated CK \u2265 1000, (4) myoglobinuria [10]. Although relatively rare, dystonic storm is a life-threatening emergency and its complications can lead to respiratory failure, re-nal failure, or even death [10,11].\n\ntoxins-13-00137-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Etiologies of opisthotonus.\n\nAcquired\tGenetic/Metabolic\t\nHypoxic injury\tKrabbe disease [12]\t\nPerinatal asphyxia [5]\tGaucher disease [13]\t\nNear-drowning [5]\tAdenylosuccinate lyase deficiency [14]\t\nCardiac/respiratory arrest [2]\tLesch-Nyhan syndrome [15]\t\nTraumatic asphyxia [2]\tGlutaric aciduria [16]\t\nInfectious/Post-infectious\tMaple syrup urine disease [17]\t\nMeningitis [18,19]\tMonoamine neurotransmitter defect [20,21]\t\nEncephalitis [22,23]\tWilson disease [24]\t\nTetanus [1,25,26,27,28]\tNeurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), e.g., pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) [15]\t\nRabies [29]\tOther genetic disorders 1 [21,30]\t\nNeurosyphilis [31]\t\t\nCerebral malaria [12]\t\t\nToxins/elevated toxic metabolites\t\t\nKernicterus [12]\t\t\nStrychnine [32]\t\t\nPhencyclidine [32]\t\t\nPhenothiazines [32]\t\t\nPropofol [33,34]\t\t\nMethoxphenidine [35]\t\t\nNeonatal caffeine overdose [32]\t\t\nIncreased Intracranial Pressure\t\t\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage [5]\t\t\nIntracerebral hemorrhage [5]\t\t\nHydrocephalus [36]\t\t\nMass/Tumor [36]\t\t\nAutoimmune\t\t\nStiff-person syndrome [37]\t\t\nAnti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [22]\t\t\nOther\t\t\nFunctional (psychogenic) dystonia [3,4,38]\t\t\nTardive dystonia [6,30,39,40,41,42,43]\t\t\nMalignant catatonia [29]\t\t\nBrainstem/cerebellar malformation [44]\t\t\nEpilepsy [12]\t\t\n1 Any genetic syndromes with prominent dystonia have the potential to manifest opisthotonus.\n\nTreatment of opisthotonus is multifactorial, first targeting reversible causes such as discontinuation of the offending dopamine-receptor blocking drugs that may be causing acute or tardive dystonia, and the consideration of disease-specific therapies. In most cases, no such interventions are available, and supportive measures are employed, often consisting of a tiered approach beginning with oral medications (benzodiazepines, baclofen, and anticholinergics), and in more refractory cases requiring intravenous benzodiazepines for exacerbations and/or surgical interventions such as intrathecal baclofen pump or deep brain stimulation [45,46,47].\n\nOver the past half-century, botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) has emerged as one of the most versatile therapeutics in neurologic and non-neurologic disorders [48]. There are dozens of indications in the field of movement disorders alone [49], including treatment of spasticity and a variety of abnormal involuntary movements such as tremor, tics, hemifacial spasm, and most commonly focal/segmental dystonia [50]. In children with refractory generalized dystonia, areas of the body that are dispropor-tionately affected, or in which the dystonia causes a great deal of discomfort, can also be selectively targeted with BoNT. It acts primarily by inhibiting the release of acetyl-choline from the presynaptic nerve terminal through interfering with fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane at the level of the neuromuscular junction.\n\nHere, we describe a series of children suffering from opisthotonus whose symptoms were adequately controlled using BoNT injections.\n\n2. Results\n\nWe evaluated seven patients (four female), age range 15 months to 13 years, all with opisthotonus, who were treated at our institution with BoNT (Table 2). Etiologies varied, with three due to identified genetic causes including pantothenate kinase asso-ciated neurodegeneration (PKAN), hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-14, CASK-related disorder, and a single case with undetermined, likely genetic etiology with normal im-aging and lack of other risk factors. Three of the patients presented with dystonic storm.\n\nAll patients were also treated with oral clonazepam and baclofen with partial though insufficient benefit. Two patients received trials of oral clonidine which was limited by excessive somnolence and hypotension as well as no clear improvement in opisthotonus, and therefore discontinued in both patients. One patient had presumed tardive dystonia and akathisia and was also treated with tetrabenazine, which was helpful for the akathisia, but with no clear improvement in the axial dystonia. The three patients who presented with dystonic storm were also managed with intrave-nous sedation, which led to control of symptoms until attempting to wean the intra-venous therapies, at which time posturing worsened.\n\nSites and dosing were chosen based on the involved muscles and estimated muscle mass and force of muscle contraction. All patients received onabotulinumtoxinA injec-tions in the paraspinal muscles and six patients received injections at other sites in-volved, with the most common being splenius capitis for management of concurrent retrocollis (five out of seven patients) (Table 3). Dosing to the paraspinal muscles ranged between 120 to 300 units (average 215.7 units) and were divided into three to five injections on each side. Total units administered ranged between 150 to 650 units (average 341.4 units). Although the dosing regimen was not planned using weight-based calculations, total units administered per kilogram for these patients ranged from 16.7 to 23.8 U/kg (average 19.6 U/kg).\n\nAll patients showed an improvement in opisthotonus within 3\u201314 days (average 6.1 days). Arching improved notably on examination of each child, and improvement was deemed to be of a meaningful and sufficient degree by caregivers of all injected children. There were no adverse effects with the exception of one patient who experi-enced neck extensor weakness, which resolved over a period of weeks and did not re-cur with subsequent injections omitting the splenius capitis. Four of seven patients re-quired repeat injections approximately three months following initial injections. No patient in this series has required escalation of treatment to involve surgical manage-ment of tone thus far. See Video S1 and Video S2 for illustrative cases before and after treatment.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nThis is the first report of childhood opisthotonus successfully treated with BoNT injections. The first description of adequate treatment of opisthotonus was by Nayler in 1803 in which he treated a 36-year-old man suffering from presumed tetanus fol-lowing a farming injury. Nayler quickly began treatment of the man which included \u201cbladders of warm water to his feet, forty drops of laudanum to be taken every four hours in a camphorated mixture with tincture of castor.\u201d When there was no im-provement, he also ordered \u201cwine freely, to the amount of a bottle in the day with a strong decoction of the bark and valerian, at the same time a liniment well charged with opium was rubbed into his chest and limbs twice a day\u201d [1]. After some period of time had passed, the patient\u2019s symptoms eventually improved.\n\nIn 1877, another patient was reported with opisthotonus, as a result of an empy-ema following a traumatic brain injury. He was treated with \u201ca mixture containing eighty grains of chloral-hydrate, half a drachm of extractum opii liquidum, and cam-phor\u201d [51].\n\nSince then, the approach to treatment of opisthotonus has been largely empirical and unsuccessful, typically involving a trial of several oral medications [30]. It was not until 1991, when Narayan and colleagues treated a patient with severe opisthotonus and generalized dystonia suffering from dystonic storm with urgent intrathecal baclo-fen that the use of more invasive measures became more common [47].\n\nFurther reports of surgical management of opisthotonus include deep brain stim-ulation [46] and intrathecal baclofen [5,13,47], each with clinical benefit. However, not all patients are good surgical candidates, the procedures are not without risks, both in-traoperatively and long-term, and there can be insufficient benefit from either surgical treatment.\n\nOur series of patients provides evidence that there is a role for BoNT injections in combination with pharmacotherapy, and prior to or supplemental to surgical inter-ventions, in children with axial dystonia, including opisthotonus. Retrospective studies have reported doses of up to 15\u201320 U/kg, and total doses of 800\u20131200 U have been safe; however, there have not been any large prospective studies in children determining a true upper dose limit [52,53,54,55]. Furthermore, the treatment was well-tolerated within this group, with no serious adverse events, and only a single case of transient neck ex-tensor weakness. None of the seven patients treated with injections required surgical treatment.\n\nThe three patients who did not require repeat injections in the months immedi-ately following initial injections may not have needed them due to the fluctuating na-ture of their underlying dystonia. This was evidenced by the eventual decrease in pos-turing even in sites not injected. Other potential reasons for improvement of dystonia also include management of pain, constipation, underlying infection, or other potential triggers of worsening dystonia, as well as maturing neural networks within the young-er population. Repeat injections remain an option, should dystonia become exacerbat-ed again in the future.\n\nLimitations of this study include its retrospective, open-label design. Injections were performed using anatomic landmarks, without electromyogram or ultrasound guidance. Moreover, there is no objective scoring system that is clearly applicable to the pediatric population, though by subjective report, video (Video S1, Video S2), and clinical documentation, there was clear improvement of opisthotonus in these patients.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nDespite the retrospective, small, and open-label design, our study provides evidence that BoNT injections into paraspinal muscles ameliorates childhood opisthotonus without serious adverse effects. This treatment should be added to the armamentaria of treatment options for this form of axial dystonia, particularly in cases refractory to oral medications. Of note, over half of the patients reviewed here are believed to have a genetic etiology for their opisthotonus.\n\n5.

The exact cause of its immune trigger is not well understood. It has been hypothesized that environmental factors can cause clusters of anti-GBM disease in genetically susceptible individuals [1].\n\nTumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) antagonists such as adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept are commonly used to treat inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Previously, there has only been one reported case of TNF-\u03b1 antagonist-induced anti-GBM disease, where the patient received adalimumab for over 4 years to manage his rheumatoid arthritis [2]. We describe the first reported case of etanercept-induced anti-GBM disease.\n\nCase Presentation\n\nA 55-year-old Caucasian man was referred to the local district general hospital by his general practitioner with a 3-week history of sudden-onset painless macroscopic haematuria. The patient has been receiving weekly etanercept injections over the past 12 months for psoriatic arthropathy, which was diagnosed in 2017 when he initially presented with oligoarthritis in his left knee and elbow. Etanercept injections were effective in managing his psoriatic arthritis symptoms in remission. The patient received methotrexate treatment prior to initiation of etanercept. Other than psoriatic arthropathy, there was no history of renal disease or other significant past medical history. The patient is a non-smoker and denied previous use of anabolic steroids or other synthetic bodybuilding supplements.\n\nIn view of the severity of his renal function derangement upon admission (serum creatinine 4.7 mg/dL), the patient was transferred to our tertiary specialist renal centre. Upon our review, he denied clinical symptoms such as haemoptysis, epistaxis, or appearances of skin rash manifestations. No features of active arthritis were detected on physical examination. Though there was mild pitting oedema on both ankles, clear chest sounds were noted on auscultation. Urinalysis showed haematoproteinuria (blood 3+, protein 1+). Chest X-ray did not identify abnormal radiological signs with clear lung fields and normal mediastinal and cardiac shadows. A further contrast computed tomography scan showed normal-sized kidneys without evidence of obstructive disease. The serum immunology panel results highlighted a significantly raised anti-GBM titre (370.1 U). Etanercept was stopped, and the patient was empirically commenced on 3 doses of pulsed intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (250 mg each), oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day), and plasma exchange via an intravascular catheter. A renal biopsy was performed which on pathological examination showed cellular crescents in 14 out of 28 glomeruli with the presence of moderate interstitial inflammation (shown in Fig. 1). Falling anti-GBM titres were observed in the initial days following treatment initiation, though serum creatinine levels continued to rise (shown in Fig. 2).\n\nThe patient tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on day 5 following admission on a routine surveillance throat swab polymerase chain reaction, which was performed as he was in close contact with another patient who tested positive. After the positive COVID-19 results, the decision was made to withhold cyclophosphamide following discussion with the patient on the risks of immunosuppressive treatment with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Treatment with 30 mg/day oral prednisolone and plasma exchange continued with monitoring of respiratory symptoms. During the next 11 days of inpatient admission, there was further decline in renal function with hyperkalaemia, for which he received 2 sessions of in-centre haemodialysis.\n\nOn day 16 following admission, the patient recovered clinically, and he received 1 g IV cyclophosphamide prior to home discharge the same day. He received another 1 g IV cyclophosphamide in the community under supervision before switching to an oral preparation of cyclophosphamide. The patient was switched to rituximab treatment afterwards and received 2 doses (1 g per dose). This was due to the development of leucopenia 2 weeks following the commencement of oral cyclophosphamide. By that point, full tissue typing results were available, which showed the patient having the HLA-DRB1-15 allele, conferring a high susceptibility of him developing anti-GBM disease [3].\n\nThe patient's serum creatinine levels decreased by almost two-thirds from peak admission levels at 5 months following hospital discharge, and he is under close follow-up review from the renal unit. Currently, there is no further immunosuppression planned as his anti-GBM antibody titres remain negative. The patient did not require further dialysis, and his psoriatic arthritis remained in remission without further requirements for etanercept or another form of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic therapy.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTNF-\u03b1, released into human circulation in its functional 17-kDa soluble form, is a cytokine primarily involved in homoeostasis of the body's immune cells [4]. TNF-\u03b1 is chiefly produced by activated macrophages, although T-helper cells and natural killer cells amongst other cell types contribute towards its production. As an acute phase reactant, excess TNF-\u03b1 production promotes systemic inflammation [5]. Collectively, TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2 are markers of the TNF pathway [6]. TNFR1 is detected in most cell types and could be activated by both the membrane-bound and trimeric soluble forms of TNF-\u03b1 [7]. TNFR2 is selectively located in cells of the immune system \u2212 oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, T cells, endothelial cells, human mesenchymal stem cells, myocytes, and thymocytes. It will usually only respond towards homotrimeric, membrane-bound forms of TNF-\u03b1 [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. TNF-\u03b1 either exists as a free protein or is bound to these circulating receptors in plasma [6].\n\nThere is dysregulation of TNF-\u03b1 in the pathophysiology of various autoimmune disorders, namely, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis-associated conditions. Excess TNF-\u03b1 also plays a key role in renal inflammation. In healthy individuals, TNFR1 could be detected within the normal glomerular endothelial structure, situated usually at the Golgi apparatus, whilst TNF-\u03b1 and TNFR2 are not expected to be found [15]. During an inflammatory response, TNF-\u03b1, TNFR1, and TNFR2 would be expressed and disseminated across the glomerular and tubular cellular structures [16]. Animal studies have demonstrated TNF-\u03b1 recruitment within the intrinsic renal structure prior to its direct effects of promoting kidney injury [17]. TNF-\u03b1 is a pleotropic cytokine and its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities through immune cell apoptosis should be recognized [18]. TNF-\u03b1 antagonists have been the conventional pharmacological treatment for autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases where a high level of TNF-\u03b1 is present, where it is a good target for inflammatory suppression. Anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy is either a monoclonal antibody or, in the case patient's scenario, a circulating receptor fusion protein such as etanercept. Monoclonal antibodies to TNF-\u03b1, such as infliximab and adalimumab, could bind to both soluble and transmembrane TNF-\u03b1, using this mechanism to downregulate TNF-\u03b1-inflammatory activity including adhesion molecule expression, cytokine production, neutrophil activity, dendritic cell production, matrix metalloproteinase production, and osteoclast differentiation. Most monoclonal antibodies to TNF-\u03b1 can lyse cells which express TNF-\u03b1 in the presence of complement [19]. Etanercept has a much longer half-life in the circulation as opposed to the simple soluble TNF receptor. As a fusion protein, etanercept functions as a decoy receptor which binds to TNF-\u03b1, thereby deactivating TNF-\u03b1 and blunting its effects of inducing an inflammatory response [20].\n\nThe associations between etanercept and intrinsic renal disease are complex. Historically, there have been multiple findings of glomerulonephritis presentations related to etanercept use (Table 1). Previously reported cases include necrotizing crescenteric glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, ANCA-positive glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura with glomerulonephritis, extracapillary glomerulonephritis, and IgA nephropathy [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. The pathophysiology of how etanercept leads to crescenteric glomerulonephritis remains unclear, but the plausible mechanisms would include a genetic predisposition, epigenetic dysregulation, and drug biotransformation. COVID-19-associated anti-GBM disease has been reported recently, but the negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and antibody serological test on the day of admission ruled out this possibility [39].\n\nCases describing manifestations of anti-GBM disease in patients receiving etanercept have not been published previously. Although the manifestation of anti-GBM disease is associated with various factors, reported cases of autoimmune glomerular injury following etanercept treatment >12 months suggest the possibility of a temporal relationship between etanercept treatment and anti-GBM disease [21, 22, 24, 33]. In our case, a renal biopsy was done even before we received the anti-GBM titre result, and hence, an immunofluorescence on the biopsy was not routinely performed. We acknowledge that this may limit the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease. However, the following points strongly supported the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease: (1) the crescents in the haematoxylin and eosin stain of the biopsy were all in similar age, (2) the high specificity of the anti-GBM antibody assay used in this case (specifically directed to type IV collagen alpha 3), (3) a genetic predisposition of our patient for anti-GBM disease by carrying the HLA-DRB1-15 allele, (4) absence of a history or clinical features of Alport's syndrome, and (5) a particularly good response to treatment (decline in anti-GBM titres and renal function recovery).\n\nStatement of Ethics\n\nWritten informed consent from the patient has been obtained for publication including images.

We herein report a case of Listeria monocytogenes ankle osteomyelitis in a 73-year-old man receiving adalimumab who was transferred to our hospital because of suspected rheumatoid arthritis (RA) flare. He reported a four-month history of left ankle swelling. A surgical biopsy revealed L. monocytogenes osteomyelitis in the left tibia and talus bones. The patient was successfully treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement. Thus, infection due to L. monocytogenes can present as ankle osteomyelitis in immunocompromised patients and may mimic an RA flare.\n\nTEXT:\npmcIntroduction\n\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis (1). Bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal or viral infections are a known, potentially serious adverse effect of these drugs. Listeria monocytogenes meningitis, sepsis, and septic arthritis in patients using TNF-alpha inhibitors have been reported, but little is known about L. monocytogenes ankle osteomyelitis associated with adalimumab treatment (1-4).\n\nWe herein summarize and compare eight L. monocytogenes osteomyelitis cases from the literature with our own case.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 73-year-old man with a 15-year history of RA was transferred to our hospital for the assessment of a possible RA flare. His medical history included suspected tuberculous lymphadenitis, ischemic heart disease, and dyslipidemia but no pneumocystis pneumonia or cytomegalovirus infection. He exhibited left ankle swelling for 4 months and gait difficulties due to pain but no diarrhea. He was administered 40 mg of adalimumab every 2 weeks for 7 months. In addition, his RA was controlled with methylprednisolone (8 mg/day) and iguratimod (50 mg/day). His diet comprised pasteurized milk and cheese daily and only common raw foods, such as vegetables and fish, consumed in Japan.\n\nOn an examination, the patient's vital signs were normal. He had a well-defined 4-cm mass superficial to the medial malleolus of his left ankle. The mass was not tender or erythematous, but mild limitation of range of motion in the left ankle joint and pain during walking were observed. The remaining examination findings were normal.\n\nBlood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count (16.7\u00d7103/\u03bcL; neutrophils 81%, lymphocytes 7%, monocytes 7%, eosinophils 1%, and basophils 0%) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (17.6 mg/dL). Plain radiographs suggested granulation of the left tibia and talus bones (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a decreased T1 signal in the tibia and talus and granulation and increased fat-suppressed T2 signal in the tibia, talus, and granulation (Fig. 1). Blood cultures were repeatedly negative. Based on his use of the immunosuppressants and history of suspected tuberculous lymphadenitis, we initially suspected tuberculosis osteomyelitis and thus discontinued the adalimumab and iguratimod treatments. To make a definite diagnosis, surgical biopsies of the distal tibia, talus, and mass in the ankle were performed, and their culture revealed the presence of L. monocytogenes. A pathological examination revealed neutrophilic infiltration in the adjacent bone and synovial membrane (Fig. 2) and L. monocytogenes abscess in the mass. There were no signs of caseating epithelioid granulomas. An analysis of the synovial fluid was culture-negative.\n\nFigure 1. (A) X-ray findings show granulation around the ankle joint (white arrowheads). (B) MRI findings show a decreased T1 signal in the tibia and talus (white arrows) and granulation (white arrowheads). (C) MRI findings further show an increased fat-suppressed T2 signal in the tibia and talus (white arrows) and granulation (white arrowheads). MRI: magnetic resonance imaging\n\nFigure 2. Pathological images of the synovial membrane (A) (\u00d740) and (B) (\u00d7200) show neutrophilic infiltration without caseating necrosis.\n\nWe diagnosed him with L. monocytogenes osteomyelitis and initiated intravenous ampicillin (2 g, 6 hours) and gentamycin (90 mg, 8 hours) on day 14. On day 24, the affected bone was resected, and cement fixation was performed. Gentamycin was discontinued on day 29 (duration: 16 days). His initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) after admission was 109 mm/h on day 29. As the symptoms improved with the removal of the infected bone and the ESR decreased to 40 mm/h, which were considered in previous reports to meet the criteria for osteomyelitis being cured or antibiotics being terminated (5-7), ampicillin treatment was discontinued on day 80 (duration: 66 days). We performed a second operation on day 143 to remove the cement and transplant autogenous iliac bone graft as a substitute (Fig. 3). He slowly recovered completely, and his gait returned to normal. There has been no recurrence of infection for three years.\n\nFigure 3. X-ray findings show surgical resection of the affected bone and cement fixation (white arrowheads) in the (A) lateral view and (B) posterior to anterior view.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur case indicates that L. monocytogenes infection can occur in the non-prosthetic ankle bone of a patient at a high risk of L. monocytogenes infection treated using adalimumab and may mimic an RA flare.\n\nL. monocytogenes ankle osteomyelitis is a rare manifestation. L. monocytogenes is a small, aerobic, Gram-positive, non-encapsulated bacillus that can cause central nervous system infection, sepsis, and gastroenteritis (8-10). In certain cases, L. monocytogenes causes localized infections (8-10). Among the 43 retrospective cases studied, L. monocytogenes joint and bone infections mainly occurred in the hip (60%) and prosthetic joints (84%) (11). L. monocytogenes osteomyelitis is even rarer, and only 10 cases have been reported (11-18). Patient characteristics were not described in two cases (11). We have summarized the distribution of infection in our case along with that in the other eight cases in Table (12-18). There were four spinal infections-two in the tibia, one in the femur, and one in the proximal phalanx-in addition to the infection in the tibia and talus in our case (12-18). Only one patient had a prosthetic joint (12). Our patient and six others had underlying or predisposing conditions, such as leukemia in two cases, diabetes mellitus in two cases, and RA in one case (12-16). The mean age was 67.8\u00b113.7 years old (12-18). Our patient and two others reported an intake of dairy products (13,17). Three patients in total (including ours) were undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (12,14).\n\nTable.

Reported risk factors for L. monocytogenes infection include pregnancy, old age, immunocompromising conditions, malignancy, immunosuppressive therapy, and dairy product consumption (19,20). Even in pasteurized milk, post-pasteurization contamination and the probable survival of L. monocytogenes are known to cause infections (21,22). In addition, TNF-alpha inhibitors increase the risk of L. monocytogenes infection (4,23). They inhibit the activation and differentiation of macrophages and phagosome formation, which play important roles in the clearance of intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and L. monocytogenes (1). The incidence rate of L. monocytogenes infection in patients with RA treated using TNF-alpha inhibitors is 0.27-0.30 per 1,000 patient-years, which is 75 times greater than that observed in the general population (23,24). Among TNF-alpha inhibitors, adalimumab and infliximab have a higher risk of infection due to M. tuberculosis than etanercept (24). Nevertheless, whether there is increased risk of L. monocytogenes osteomyelitis from adalimumab over other TNF-alpha antagonists is not known. Furthermore, although osteomyelitis was not observed, the risk of septic arthritis in patients with RA treated using TNF-alpha inhibitors was highest in the early months of therapy (25). In fact, our case developed the symptoms three months after starting adalimumab. In contrast, the risk of infection increases with longer steroid use (26). Similarly, our case had been treated for RA for 15 years. In addition, our patient may have had arthritis owing to the possibility of a false-negative L. monocytogenes in the joint fluid culture and the findings of synovial inflammation.\n\nIn addition, L. monocytogenes osteomyelitis can mimic an RA flare and hence may be misdiagnosed in patients with RA. The symptoms of an RA flare closely resemble those of osteomyelitis in terms of the presence of a fever, fatigue, pain, and swelling (27,28). Based on our case and previously published cases, 44.4% (4/9) of the patients experienced pain or swelling involving the hand or foot. However, there are some indications to help differentiate between these two presentations. For example, RA flares may be prone to occur rapidly and typically resolve within one to two weeks, but L. monocytogenes osteomyelitis may tend to present insidiously (12-16,27-29). Among 43 cases of L. monocytogenes joint and bone infections, 73% were subacute or chronic in their onset, developing over more than 7 days (11). In our case comparison, 66.7% (6/9) of cases also presented with a subacute or chronic onset, and the mean duration from the onset to a hospital visit was 53.4\u00b155.6 days (12-18). In addition, Listeria infection tends to involve a single bone compared with an RA flare (12-18,27-29). As mentioned in the previous paragraph, a detailed medical history to evaluate the risk factors for Listeria infection may prove helpful (4,19,20,23). Some diagnostic tests are also important to differentiate between the two conditions. However, non-specific markers of inflammation tend to be found in both conditions, as the ESR and CRP are elevated in both Listeria infection and RA, and the ferritin changes in infection or non-infectious inflammation have not been well determined owing to inconsistent findings among studies (30,31). Nevertheless, the following findings in imaging studies are helpful for diagnosing osteomyelitis: 1) MRI findings of extensive and intense bone marrow changes (32-34) and 2) ultrasound findings of subcutaneous edema, subcutaneous power Doppler signal changes, and periosteal vascularity (35). Finally, a biopsy is crucial for the final diagnosis. In fact, in our patient, the medical history, MRI results, and biopsy findings greatly contributed to the final diagnosis.\n\nIn conclusion, L. monocytogenes osteomyelitis in the ankle can occur in patients with RA receiving adalimumab and may mimic an RA flare. Since TNF-alpha inhibitors are widely used, it is important to consider checking for infection, including L. monocytogenes, in patients presenting with joint or bone pain. Further research is necessary to determine whether or not such missed infections may be more common than previously considered.\n\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nWe express our sincere thanks to Dr. Akane Fukuda for supporting the data collection.",

Recently, however, persistent cases of cryoglobulinemia have been reported, and the ideal approach to treating such cases has not been established. We herein report a case of the successful treatment of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis with rituximab, DAAs, occasional plasmapheresis and long-term steroid, with the patient's renal function and proteinuria improving over the long term despite serologically persistent cryoglobulinemia. This case suggests the efficacy of combination treatment with rituximab, DAAs, occasional plasmapheresis and long-term steroid for persistent cryoglobulinemia.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nCryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that aggregate at low temperatures both in vitro and in vivo. In the human body, temperatures below normal body temperature cause them to accumulate in various organs (1); this is a disease state known as cryoglobulinemia. The clinical manifestations of cryoglobulinemia are hyperviscosity syndrome and systemic vasculitis. Renal involvement is common and manifests as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis as the characteristic histological finding (1). Decades ago, treatments for cryoglobulinemia were similar to those for other forms of systemic vasculitis; in 1991, however, it was shown that about 90% of cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia are associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (2) and that chronic HCV infection triggers B-cell expansion, which results in the production of cryoglobulins (3).\n\nRituximab was reported as an efficacious treatment in 2003 (4,5) and became the recommended immunosuppressive treatment for patients with histologically active HCV-associated glomerular disease who do not respond to antiviral therapy according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines in 2018 (6). In addition, direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have been used for the last decade to improve the clearance of HCV (7). Although these treatments are expected to improve the clinical outcomes of cryoglobulinemia, several cases of treatment failure or relapse after rituximab and DAAs have recently been reported (8,9).\n\nWe herein report a case of serologically persistent cryoglobulinemia in which glomerulonephritis was successfully treated with rituximab, DAAs, occasional plasmapheresis and long-term steroid.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 68-year-old man was referred to our nephrology department because of progressive renal insufficiency and proteinuria. He had been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C in his teens but had not been treated for it. He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at 55 years old. He had a history of myocardial infarction at 59 and 63 years old. In addition, one year previously, he had been hospitalized due to worsening depression. One month before the present admission, his serum creatinine level had increased from 1.61 to 2.11 mg/dL. At that time, he had noted bilateral leg edema. He was admitted to our hospital to investigate the cause of his worsening renal function and edema.\n\nOn admission, his height and weight were 160.7 cm and 61.7 kg, respectively. He did not notice any weight gain because he did not weigh himself regularly. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 153/89 mmHg, pulse 63 beats/min and temperature 36.3\u00b0C. A physical examination revealed bilateral leg pitting edema, no purpura, no cutaneous ulcer and no paresthesia, with otherwise normal findings. A complete blood count revealed a hemoglobin concentration of 8.8 g/dL. A laboratory examination showed aspartate aminotransferase of 44 U/L, alanine transaminase of 46 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase of 268 U/L, total protein of 5.0 g/dL, albumin of 2.3 g/dL, creatinine of 2.45 mg/dL and total cholesterol of 213 mg/dL (Table). Occult blood and proteinuria were positive on a urinalysis, and the 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 7.4 g/day. Hemoglobin A1c was 5.9%. Immunological tests revealed negative results for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-DNA antibody, proteinase-3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), myeloperoxidase ANCA and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody. Cryoglobulins were detected through a qualitative analysis, and cryocrit was 5%. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) was elevated to 692 mg/dL (reference range: 27-205 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor (RF) was also elevated to 2018 IU/mL (reference range: 0-15.0 IU/mL). Complements were suppressed, as follows: complement C3 at 56.3 mg/dL (reference range: 70.5-125.6 mg/dL) and complement C4 at 2.6 mg/dL (reference range: 10.6-33.0 mg/dL). A virologic test showed serotype 1 HCV RNA of 7.0 LogIU/mL.\n\nTable.

Tufts were segmentally ballooned and filled with eosinophilic materials, which were immunohistochemically positive for IgM and thought to be hyaline thrombi (Fig. 1B, C). Immunofluorescent staining was strongly positive for IgG, IgM, and C3 in the glomerular capillary loops. Kappa and lambda light chains were equally positive in the glomerular capillary loops. Electron microscopy revealed abundant electron-dense deposits in the subendothelial areas, with cylinder-like structures visible at high magnification (Fig. 1D, E). Based on these findings, we made a diagnosis of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis.\n\nFigure 1. Renal pathological findings. Double contour of glomerular basement membrane (arrow), mesangial interposition and endocapillary hypercellularity (arrowhead) were globally observed (periodic acid-methenamine-silver; PAM stain, original magnification \u00d7200) (A). Hyaline thrombi (*) were also detected as immunohistochemically positive for IgM (B, C). Electron microscopy showed abundant electron-dense deposits in subendothelial areas (D) (scale bar 10 \u03bcm). High magnification of the area shown in the box revealed cylinder-like structures (E) (scale bar 1.0 \u03bcm).\n\nClinical course\n\nThe clinical course during the patient's hospitalization is shown in Fig. 2. On day 9, he became oliguric, and his serum creatinine level increased to 3.08 mg/dL. Simultaneous hemodialysis and cryofiltration were performed on days 9 and 10. Subsequently, cryofiltration was performed weekly. On day 16, based on the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis, 30 mg of prednisolone was initiated. Subsequently, proteinuria decreased significantly, but marked hyperglycemia appeared, and the patient was started on insulin before every meal. On day 21, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir was started for HCV infection. Because massive proteinuria (around 4 g/gCr) and microscopic hematuria persisted, 500 mg of methylprednisolone (mPSL) was administered for 3 consecutive days starting on day 27, and 375 mg/m2 of weekly rituximab for 4 weeks was started after that. During the four weeks of rituximab administration, the dose of the oral steroid was tapered week by week. After oral mPSL was decreased to 8 mg, his proteinuria improved to 3.0 g/gCr, and his edema disappeared. HCV-RNA decreased to less than 1.2 LogIU/mL on day 49. He was discharged from our hospital on day 53.\n\nFigure 2. The patient\u2019s clinical course during hospitalization. Before the diagnosis with cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis, the patient needed hemodialysis twice. Cryofiltration was also performed. After the diagnosis, prednisolone, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir and rituximab were started on a weekly basis. Prednisolone was tapered early because of worsening hyperglycemia. On the 53rd day of hospitalization, he was discharged, although proteinuria persisted at around 3 g/gCr. PSL: prednisolone, mPSL: methylprednisolone, RTX: rituximab, GLE: glecaprevir, PIB: pibrentasvir\n\nShortly after discharge (Fig. 3), the patient's proteinuria increased to \uff1e8 g/gCr. A test for HCV-RNA reported undetectable levels, and glecaprevir-pibrentasvir was withdrawn after the eight-week treatment. We suspected that cryoglobulin had persisted in his body and was worsening his glomerulonephritis based on his persistent high levels of RF. To treat this, we performed plasma exchange (PE). Although PE removed more than 60% of his cryoglobulins, his RF level increased after PE, and complement C3 continued to be consumed. When mPSL was tapered to 6 mg at 2 months after discharge, proteinuria increased, and PE was performed again. Subsequently he was maintained on 8 mg of mPSL and his proteinuria gradually declined. Six months after discharge, a final session of PE was performed because of the increasing proteinuria and decreasing complement C3.\n\nFigure 3. Long-term follow-up showing cryoglobulinemic hallmarks. Soon after discharge, proteinuria was exacerbated, but one session of plasma exchange relieved this symptom. Later, proteinuria had ameliorated, but the RF level had rebounded, and complement C3 was still being consumed. After the steroid dosage was decreased, proteinuria increased again. Accordingly, plasma exchange was performed again, and his mPSL dosage was increased, leading to decreased proteinuria. Although the patient's RF level remained high throughout the clinical course, the consumption of C3 was diminished, and proteinuria eventually fell to around 0.3 g/gCr. For details concerning the patient's clinical course during hospitalization, please see Figure 2 above. RF: rheumatoid factor, DAAs: direct-acting antiviral agents, PE: plasma exchange\n\nOver the long-term, HCV-RNA remained undetectable throughout follow-up, and the CD20+ B-cell count was as low as 0.4% at 22 months after discharge, yet cryoglobulin remained at detectable levels, and the cryocrit remained at 4% at 25 months after discharge. Finally, 27 months after discharge, the patient remained on 6 mg of mPSL, and his RF levels were still \uff1e1,800 IU/mL, but his proteinuria had decreased to around 0.3 g/gCr, and he had never exhibited any symptoms of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. His serum creatinine level at this time was stable around 1.6 mg/dL, as it was before the illness (Table).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present case, cryoglobulinemia persisted, and glomerulonephritis appeared imminent despite treatment with rituximab, DAAs, a high-dose steroid and plasmapheresis. As the patient's proteinuria began to worsen, we continued low-dose steroid treatment and performed PE occasionally. Over the long term, his proteinuria gradually improved. Finally, the patient achieved remission for glomerulonephritis, although his cryoglobulinemia persisted.\n\nNotably, this is a rare case of persistent cryoglobulinemia after B-cell depletion had been achieved and the virologic response had been maintained with rituximab and DAAs. There have been several previous reports of persistent cryoglobulinemia after HCV eradication by DAAs (10-13). These can be explained by the presence of persistent B-cell clones producing cryoglobulins after HCV eradication (10). Therefore, B-cell depletion therapy is needed to treat these cases of cryoglobulinemia. Rituximab is a B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 that is widely expressed among B-cell-lineage cells, except for plasmablasts and plasma cells. Thus, plasmablasts and plasma cells can still produce cryoglobulins after rituximab treatment until they are eradicated by other means. Indeed, in previous studies of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis treated with rituximab, it took a few months for the RF and IgM levels to decrease after rituximab treatment (4,14). In the present case, however, the RF and IgM levels remained high, almost as high as they had been at the diagnosis, even 27 months after treatment. This persistent elevation of cryoglobulinemic hallmarks can be explained by the presence of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), which are observed in the bone marrow or spleens of patients with immune thrombocytopenia for up to six months following the start of rituximab treatment (15,16). LLPCs have special gene profiles that are programmed for long life and are characterized by CD19- CD38hi CD138+ cells by flow cytometry (17). We did not confirm the presence of LLPCs in our patient, but we speculate that LLPCs might have continued to produce the cryoglobulins that persisted in our patient.\n\nImportantly, we should emphasize that this patient's cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis was successfully treated despite the persistence of cryoglobulinemia. We believe that occasional plasmapheresis after rituximab treatment, administered in response to worsening proteinuria or decreasing C3, was an effective means of controlling his glomerulonephritis. Plasmapheresis is generally effective in urgent, life-threatening cryoglobulinemia cases in advance of the initiation of fundamental treatment (1). However, we also consider it a reasonable means of removing cryoglobulins that may still be produced by LLPCs even after rituximab therapy. Indeed, there is one reported case in which long-term plasmapheresis after rituximab improved cutaneous lesions of cryoglobulinemia (18). Our case indicates that plasmapheresis after rituximab is also effective for cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. We selected PE as the modality for plasmapheresis after rituximab in order to supply immunoglobulin at the same time. A variety of plasmapheresis protocols have been reported, and further studies will be needed in order to identify more effective protocols for conducting plasmapheresis in combination with rituximab.\n\nIn addition, continuous low-dose steroid administration after rituximab was effective for our patient. In previous reports, steroids were withdrawn early or avoided in rituximab protocols for cryoglobulinemia (4,14). In our case, however, when mPSL was tapered to 6 mg, glomerulonephritis deteriorated, so we continued 8 mg of mPSL for long-term maintenance. This may be due to the difference in the baseline activities of cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis between the previous report and our present case (proteinuria: previous report 2.3\u00b12.1 g/day vs. our case 7.4 g/day; C3, previous report 125.7\u00b160.8 mg/dL vs. our case 56.3 mg/dL) (14). As steroid is a conventional immunosuppressive agent, its effectiveness in treating cryoglobulinemia has long been recognized, and various mechanisms have been proposed. In the present case, we suspect a putative mechanism associated with complement C5 activation, which is reported to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis (19). Low-dose steroid can prevent complement C5 activation caused by cryoglobulins, which might have improved the cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis, although cryoglobulinemia was persistent. In addition, another putative mechanism of steroid is related to LLPCs, a special population of plasma cells which is mentioned above. LLPCs are reportedly surrounded by CD4+ T-cells, which are assumed to produce survival signals for LLPCs (20). Low-dose steroid can suppress CD4+ T-cell activities and LLPC proliferation, which might enhance the efficacy of rituximab. In this way, a low-dose steroid may be effective in combination with rituximab for suppressing C5 activation and LLPC proliferation, especially in patients with persistent cryoglobulinemia.\n\nIn conclusion, we described a case of the successful treatment of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemia with serologically persistent cryoglobulinemia using rituximab, DAAs, occasional plasmapheresis and a long-term steroid. When patients show persistent cryoglobulinemia after rituximab treatment, the presence of LLPCs should be considered. Occasional plasmapheresis is a reasonable treatment even after rituximab for such patients. Low-dose steroid administration can also suppress glomerulonephritis and improve the efficacy of rituximab, especially in patients with persistent cryoglobulinemia.

One option for managing them is the use of linezolid. We hereby report the in-host emergence of linezolid resistance (LR) in MRSA in CF siblings via a population analysis. A collection of 171 MRSA strains from 68 samples were characterized by determining their linezolid Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs), analyzing the locus of staphylococcal protein A (spa) and whole genome sequencing. Courses of linezolid were retraced. Strains belonged to three spa types (t002, t045, t127) and two sequence types (ST1, ST5). Emergence of LR occurred under treatment, one year apart in both siblings, in the CC5-MRSA-I Geraldine clone harboring the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-encoding gene. Resistance was related to a G2576T substitution present in a variable number of 23S rRNA gene copies. Susceptible and resistant strains were co-isolated within samples. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism-based analysis revealed complex colonizations by highly diversified, clonally related populations. LR remains rare in MRSA and there are very few longitudinal analyses documenting its emergence. Analyzing a large MRSA collection revealed new aspects of LR emergence: it emerges in specific subclonal lineages resulting from adaptive diversification of MRSA in the CF lung and this heterogeneity of intra-sample resistance may contribute to compromising antibiotic management.\n\nTEXT:\n1. Introduction\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder marked by a multi-organ disease due to a defect in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein, a transmembrane ion channel. Alteration in transmembrane ion exchanges result in abnormal mucus decreasing microbial clearance and creating local conditions favorable to bacterial persistence. In the respiratory tract, a cycle of colonization/infection and inflammation is established, leading to lung damage which has been identified as being responsible for morbidity and mortality in CF patients.\n\nThe most frequently identified microbial species in CF patients is Staphylococcus aureus, with 70% of patients in the United States having at least one bacterial culture during the year 2019 and 62% in France during 2018 [1,2]. Regarding multidrug-resistant S. aureus strains, known as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a clear picture has emerged between the US and Europe, where 25% of the patients in the US had at least one MRSA isolate in 2019 compared to the lower prevalence observed in Europe (6% in France in 2018) [1,2]. This could be related to the spread of community-acquired MRSA clones in the general population from these two distinct continents.\n\nMRSA can establish different types of lung colonization, i.e., transient, intermittent or chronic colonization. As detecting MRSA in the respiratory tract of CF patients is associated with lower lung function [3] and worse survival [4], and persistent infection is associated with a faster decline in the lung function [5], eradication is currently recommended. However, due to the antimicrobial multidrug-resistance patterns of MRSA, the options for antibiotic treatment are limited and there are no current recommendations or guidelines specific to the management of MRSA infections in CF. These usually combine antibiotics, topical decontamination and environmental cleansing. Antibiotic choices for MRSA infections include cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, fusidic acid (not licensed in the United States), minocycline and vancomycin (possibly inhaled), used either alone or in combination [6]. Linezolid, belonging to the oxazolidinone family, was discovered in the 1990s. It was first approved for use in 2000 and has been available in France since 2002. The drug inhibits the early stages of bacterial protein production after fixation on the 50S ribosomal subunit (domain V region of the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene), and is also thought to inhibit the expression of virulence factors and decrease toxin production. Based on its action on MRSA, it was soon used for the successful treatment of pulmonary exacerbations due to MRSA in CF patients [6,7,8].\n\nRapidly, and as classically observed for many new antibiotics, studies reported the emergence of linezolid-resistant S. aureus (LRSA) in the general population in 2001 and in people with CF in 2004 [9]. Several mechanisms were associated with resistance to linezolid, all affecting the linezolid binding site. These included mutations in domain V of one or more of the copies of the 23S rRNA (rrl) gene, with G2576T being the most frequently observed mutation, mutations or deletions in the L3 and/or L4 ribosomal proteins, and acquisition of the plasmid-borne cfr gene, a multidrug-resistance gene encoding a 23S rRNA methylase. To date, resistance to linezolid is still considered exceptional, as fewer than 1% of MRSA strains worldwide are found to resist against linezolid [10]. Similar observations have also been made in the context of CF [11,12].\n\nWe hereby describe the in-host emergence of linezolid resistance in siblings with CF treated by linezolid through a populational analysis. Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of successively recovered MRSA strains revealed complex MRSA colonization and new aspects of the emergence of linezolid resistance in CF compared with the available literature.\n\n2. Results\n\n2.1. Patient Follow-Up and Microbiological Data\n\nMRSA were isolated from all routinely sampled sputum specimens analyzed for both patients over the 2010-2016 period (45 and 46 samples for Patients P1 and P2, respectively). The isolation timeline of the 171 available MRSA strains (102 and 69 for patients P1 and P2, respectively) included in the study is presented for Patient 1 and Patient 2 in Figure 1, respectively, together with patient data (birth year, year of CF diagnosis, year of first MRSA colonization). Included MRSA had been isolated from 44 and 24 routinely sampled sputum specimens, respectively; two to four colonial morphotypes per sample were studied for Patient 1, and one to five colonial morphotypes per sample were studied for Patient 2.\n\n2.2. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Profile and Linezolid Resistance\n\nAll strains were MRSA displaying resistance to erythromycin, lincomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin, fusidic acid and rifampicin, and susceptibility to pristinamycin, gentamicin, minocycline, ofloxacin, fosfomycin, cotrimoxazole, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline, a profile compatible with the tst+ Geraldine clone to which the strains were affiliated. Linezolid resistance was the only modification detected in the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern over time and was first detected in January 2015 for Patient 1 (a 14-year-old) and in December 2015 for Patient 2 (a 10-year-old). Patients 1 and 2 had previously received thirteen and seventeen 15-day courses of linezolid, respectively. After first emergence, LRSA strains were identified in all subsequent samples included in the study. Testing up to five cultural morphotypes per sample revealed that linezolid-susceptible strains were co-isolated with LRSA strains in 10 out of the 18 samples including resistant strains (6/10 and 4/8 in Patients P1 and P2, respectively), as was observed the co-isolation of strains with distinct levels of linezolid resistance (Figure 2). For some strains, it should also be noted that discrepant results were observed between methods (Etest, disk diffusion and/or automated dilution technique) and that detection of linezolid-resistance may be detected after 48h of incubation only (Figure 3). The emergence of linezolid resistance did not modify the lung function or the rate of pulmonary exacerbation (Figure 2).\n\n2.3. Strain Genotyping\n\nThe spa screening approach showed that MRSA strains presented three distinct profiles. spa typing showed that these three profiles corresponded to three spa types (t002, t045, t127), and MLST/wgMLST confirmed that these three spa types belonged to 2 STs (ST5 for t002 and t045, ST1 for t127). According to the Ridom SpaServer, the three spa types identified in our study had previously been reported in different countries and their frequencies were 6.57% for t002 (the third most common spa type in the database), 2.63% for t127 and 0.69% for t045 (http://spa.ridom.de/frequencies.shtml, accessed on 20 February 2021). MRSA of t002 were the most identified in both patients, representing 85% of strains in the study (86% in Patient 1 and 98% in Patient 2). Patient 1 presented a co-colonization by MRSA of two related spa types, t002 and t045 with t045 (repeat succession 26-17-20-17-12-17-16), presenting a deletion of three repeats compared with t002 (repeat succession 26-23-17-34-17-20-17-12-17-16).\n\nOne MRSA of t127/ST1 was found in Patient 2 but did not manage to colonize as it was only identified once. Regarding the linezolid susceptibility of the three MRSA types identified, resistance was observed in t002 strains only (Figure 2).\n\n2.4. Identifying of the Genetic Determinant of Linezolid Resistance\n\nFour LRSA strains (two strains co-isolated from the last sample included in the study for each of the two patients and showing linezolid MICs of 16, 24, 32 and >256 mg/L) were submitted to whole genome sequencing to determine the genetic determinant(s) of linezolid resistance. Whole genome sequence-based analysis identified a unique mutation (G2576T substitution) in the sequences of the four LRSA strains analyzed, whereas this substitution was not found in any of the 13 WGSs analyzed for susceptible strains, either of t002 or t045 (data not shown).\n\nI-CeuI macrorestriction-based analysis of the DNA of seven strains (the three susceptible strains isolated in 2007 and the four LRSA strains isolated in 2016) revealed that all possessed five copies of the 23S rRNA gene (data not shown). Depending on the strain, three or four of the five copies of the 23 rRNA gene harbored the G2576T substitution (Supplementary Table S1). Strains with MICs of 16, 24 or 32 mg/L of linezolid harbored three mutated copies and the strain with MIC >256 mg/L harbored four mutated copies. rplD (encoding the L4 ribosomal protein) and rplC (encoding the L3 ribosomal protein) genes were wild type and the cfr gene was not detected.\n\n2.5. Relationship between Isolates\n\nThe SNP-based analysis revealed that whole genome sequences (WGSs) of the 9 strains analyzed for Patient 1 presented 12 to 71 SNPs, whereas those of the 8 strains analyzed for Patient 2 presented 41 to 135 SNPs. On an inter-patient level, 18 to 121 SNPs were found between WGSs (Table 1). According to the study by Ankrum et al., all strains were considered as clonally related, including strains of t002 and t045 in Patient 2, and the SNPs observed were considered as corresponding to intra-host diversification.\n\nOne strain isolated in Patient 1 in 2010 had over 1000 SNPs with other strains isolated and was thus considered as a superinfecting strain, unrelated to the persistent clone in this patient. The latter strain was not detected using spa screening showing that our approach may have underestimated the diversity of strains.\n\nIn total, we considered that all other isolates shared a common ancestor. In both patients, an irregular but overall increase in the number of SNPs was observed over time, as was the observed genetic diversity among strains co-isolated within a sample (Table 1).\n\n3. Discussion\n\nLinezolid resistance remains a rare finding in CF. We identified 13 previously published studies in this setting, reporting a total of 34 patients with LRSA (of which two described linezolid-dependent strains) [9,11,12,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. The only multicentric study currently available includes 277 MRSA strains from individual patients attending seven pediatric CF centers in the USA and showed that 0.4% were LRSA [12]. In 2011, also in the USA, Endimiani et al. reported that 2% of patients (8/390) attending their center over a 7-year period had at least one respiratory specimen culture with an LRSA isolate [11]. LRSA was more rarely reported in European countries (10 CF patients with LRSA), probably due to the distinct epidemiology and the less significant rate of CF patients colonized by MRSA in Europe (e.g., 6% in France versus 25% in the USA). In Europe, LRSA was mostly observed in Spain and Italy, whereas our study is the third one reporting LRSA in CF patients in France [17,23].\n\nIn most studies, the level of resistance to linezolid is associated with the mechanism of resistance. A higher level of resistance has been observed along with the number of mutated rrl gene copies [11]. Strains may also cumulate the different mechanisms associated with resistance to linezolid [19]. Here, we observed a heterogeneous level of resistance to linezolid depending on the strain and the patient: strains from one patient exhibited high MIC values >256 mg/L although not all 23S rRNA gene copies were mutated and this was in the absence of other identified resistance mechanisms, which is an uncommon observation.\n\nSimilarly, distinct dynamics of resistance were observed between siblings with strains displaying high MICs >256 mg/L observed as soon as resistance emerged, whereas these were never described in Patient 2. Linezolid exposure has been shown to be significantly associated with the emergence of linezolid resistance in most\u2014but not all\u2014patients [11,21,25]. It is worth noting that when Endimiani et al. restricted their study to patients who had received linezolid, the rate of patients with LRSA reached 10.4% [11]. In our report, both siblings had received several courses of linezolid resulting in roughly similar pressure before the emergence of resistance (195 and 255 cumulated treatment days, respectively). In the literature, we found that the time of emergence greatly varied according to studies, showing that multifactorial determinants for emergence are probably involved in a specific host/S. aureus partnership. Selection of LRSA was indeed observed as early as after 13 days of treatment [17,18] to a mean time of 128 days of treatment (range: 24\u2013453 days) in the largest study by Yu et al. reporting on 11 patients with LRSA [21]. One of the factors favoring the selection of LRSA clearly identified in previous studies is the failure to reach adequate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic conditions, a particularly difficult point with CF and pediatric patients [9,11,15,26]. In our study, there was no evidence of failure to comply with treatment by the two patients, but no linezolid dosing was performed during the study period.\n\nIn our retrospective study, we noted that linezolid resistance had been overlooked for these patients, both siblings having received linezolid after the emergence of LRSA due to non-detection of resistance in routine practice. A combination of several concomitant factors contributing to this non-detection deserve special attention: (i) a non-systematic testing of linezolid in the antimicrobial susceptibility testing panel at the time of the study (the transfer of linezolid from the complementary to the standard panel of antibiotics to be systematically tested in the antibiogram committee of the French Society for Microbiology (CA-SFM) recommendations for S. aureus only became effective in France in September 2018), (ii) a complete antibiogram was only performed once a year in chronic MRSA infections, (iii) the difficulty of detecting resistance as explained herein, and (iv) the intra-sample heterogeneity definitely proven in this work and discussed later. Although the recommendations of the CA-SFM are to carefully examine the inhibition zone and include a warning to say that detection of inducible resistance may require prolonged incubation and a reading after 48h of incubation [13], S. aureus disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility assays are usually read after 24 h of incubation and this may account for the non-detection of resistance to linezolid as exemplified herein. Although the study was not pursued after the end of 2016 for either patient, as there were no further courses of linezolid, both patients are still colonized by LRSA, a congruent observation with the persistence of LRSA described in previous studies even in the absence of linezolid exposure [15,23].\n\nResistance to linezolid has more often been reported among clones that are endemic to the corresponding reporting country, such as the Spanish clone (ST125-spa type t067-SCCmec Ivc) [19,20], the Brazilian MRSA clone [9], the highly prevalent EMRSA-16 (ST36-MRSA-II) clone in the UK [15], or the USA100 clone (ST5/SCCmec II), also known as the New York/Japan clone [11,18]. Here, we report the first cases of linezolid resistance in strains belonging to the MRSA Geraldine clone which contains the tst gene encoding for toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). This tst+ MRSA clone is an epidemic clone of ST5 genetic background which harbors a peculiar, truncated SCCmec Type I cassette and occurs mainly in young people in whom it is responsible for a wide diversity of clinical syndromes including toxin-mediated and suppurative diseases [27]. It is responsible for both hospital- and community-acquired infections and represents a minor clone among invasive MRSA strains in France [28]. MRSA isolates that carry the TSST-1-encoding gene have been extremely rarely reported in CF [29] and their role in disease evolution and patients\u2019 clinical status have yet to be investigated.\n\nAlthough our study has certain limitations, including those inherent to retrospective studies and the fact that not all the strains were analyzed by WGS, its main originality is that it includes the study of several strains per sample over a long period of time. Indeed, longitudinal studies of this kind are rare in the literature [15,17,19,23] and none of them included as many strains per patient and several strains per sample. Despite this, we have probably not characterized the entire diversity of MRSA in the siblings included as shown by the unrelated strain in WGS showing spa type t002 identical to other colonizing strains. Nevertheless, the population analysis we conducted has revealed a complex, dynamic colonization by a phenotypically (susceptibility/resistance to linezolid) and/or genotypically (spa types, SNPs) highly diversified MRSA population. Such populations encompassing a wide variety of subclonal variants, including variants displaying a striking diversity of antimicrobial resistance patterns, have been largely reported for Gram-negative pathogens during chronic colonization in the lungs of CF patients [30,31,32,33,34]. They reflect an adaptive strategy developed by CF pathogens for long-term survival in the CF lung, allowing them to quickly adapt and face fluctuating selective pressures, the so-called \u201cinsurance hypothesis\u201d [35]. For S. aureus, diversified populations have been more rarely documented in CF [14,36,37,38,39] and population heterogeneity has only once been related to antimicrobial susceptibility patterns [36]. Here, we documented intrasample heterogeneity of susceptibility to linezolid, which may explain some of the previous observations (alternate detection of susceptible and resistant strains, non-chronological accumulation of SNPs) made by other authors [14,17,23]. This was only related to linezolid emergence observed in the subpopulation of t002 in Patient 1, whereas the variant of t045 remained susceptible despite similar exposure to linezolid. It is currently unknown whether some MRSA genetic backgrounds or lineages may lead to linezolid resistance emergence faster and this point warrants further investigations.\n\nIn siblings with LRSA strains, differentiating cross-transmission of the resistant strain (which had emerged in one of the patients and was further transmitted between siblings) from the emergence of resistance in the MRSA colonizing each patient is highly challenging. We reexamined the results of three previous studies that included siblings [11,19,21]. Caballero et al. noted that their results may indicate a cross-transmission event between siblings, as they found that the isolates had identical genotypes and linezolid resistance levels and determinants [19]. Similarly, Yu et al. identified LRSA at the same date in siblings with significant different exposure to linezolid that more likely reflects cross-transmission of LRSA [21]. However, Endimiani et al. reported a more complex picture of LRSA colonization in siblings with long-term exposure to linezolid and LRSA detection 10 months apart. Indeed, strains displayed the same resistance mechanism, i.e., G2576T mutation; however, the mutation was observed in a distinct number of rrl gene copies. Interestingly, the G2576T mutation combination was unique to each patient (i.e., the mutated copy observed in the first patient detected with LRSA was not part of the three mutated copies observed in the second patient). Although strains shared identical PFGE profiles and related spa types t002 and t2051, the overall results suggested a distinct within-host evolution of related strains through homologous recombination of wild-type and mutated rrn genes producing the different numbers and locations of the G2576T mutation observed while not excluding a previous event of cross-transmission [11]. In our study, that is, the only one including WGS analysis to compare LRSA strains from siblings, strains isolated in 2016 were considered as \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201cvery closely related\u201d between siblings. However, a similarly close relationship had already been observed between strains isolated in siblings in 2007 making it difficult to distinguish linezolid resistance emergence in each of the two patients from their colonizing strains from a cross-contamination event that apparently occurred after resistance emergence in the first sibling during the year 2015. However, we noted distinct diversification rates in each patient, with all strains in Patient 1 showing \u2264 71 SNPs, whereas strains in Patient 2 diverged by up to 137 SNPs with an irregular but overall increase in SNPs over time in both patients, and also on an interpatient level (18-22 SNPs in 2007, 39-74 SNPs in 2012, 101 in 2014, 43-82 in 2016). Although we were unable to trace and date all the potential cross-transmission events between siblings, LRSA strains seemed to have emerged from strains that had differentially evolved in both hosts.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nStill rarely described in CF, linezolid resistance must be carefully monitored in CF patients chronically colonized by MRSA. This included a regular antibiotic susceptibility testing, particularly for drugs used in the management of these patients. The bacterial populations colonizing these patients are highly complex and dynamic, particularly in patients receiving linezolid whether for anti-MRSA purposes or as part of the antimicrobial regimen against nontuberculous mycobacteria.\n\n5. Materials and Methods\n\n5.1. Patients, Bacterial Strains and Data Collection\n\nTwo CF siblings (Patients P1 and P2) attending the CF center at Montpellier University Hospital, France, were included in this study. Ethical approval was obtained through the Institutional Review Board at N\u00eemes University hospital (Interface Recherche Bio\u00e9thique IRB n 21.03.01, 04 March 2021). Both patients are chronically colonized by MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These are two sisters whose genotype is F508del/R553X, born in 1991 (P1) and 1996 (P2), respectively. The oldest child had a childhood and adolescence without an antibiotic infusion, without bronchial obstruction and simply the use of oral antibiotics against S.aureus. There was a sharp decline of FEV1 from the age of 18, concomitant with P. aeruginosa colonization) (Figure 2). She is glucose intolerant and has exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Her younger sister had a much stormier childhood with quarterly infusions since the age of 10 for bronchial exacerbations and severe obstructive disorder (first P. aeruginosa colonization at the age of 12). She is diabetic without the need for insulin and has exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nMRSA bacterial strains isolated from routinely sampled sputum specimens and analyzed as part of the standard follow-up of both patients were included. During this standard follow-up, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed once a year according to the National Diagnosis and Care Plan for Cystic Fibrosis for long-term chronically colonized patients by multidrug resistant bacteria [40]. Strains had been collected over a 7-year period (2010\u20132016) and stored frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Additionally, one strain from early infection episodes in each patient (2007) was included for the purpose of comparing them with strains isolated during the study period (these strains were the first ones available for P1 and P2). Both strains were previously analyzed by the microarray ADN Alere\u00ae\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus genotyping kit 2.0 (Alere Technologies, Jena, Germany) [41] showing them to belong to the CC5-MRSA-I Geraldine clone, described as agr-2, ST5, spa type t002 or related, and SCCmec type I, and harboring the tst gene [28]. Data regarding age at first MRSA isolation, co-colonizing pathogens and linezolid courses received by patients P1 and P2 were collected retrospectively.\n\n5.2. Culture Conditions and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing\n\nAll strains were cultured on Trypticase Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019\u00c9toile, France) and one colony was subcultured onto the same agar medium for all further analyses.\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and was interpreted according to the recommendations of the CA-SFM/EUCAST for Staphylococcus [13].\n\nFor linezolid, Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was also determined by the Etest method (bioM\u00e9rieux). According to the CA-SFM/EUCAST recommendations, resistance to linezolid is defined as MICs > 4 mg/L or inhibition zone diameters < 21 mm around a 10-\u03bcg disk, and inducible resistance may require a prolonged incubation and reading after 48 h of incubation [13]. Results of linezolid susceptibility assays (disk and Etest) were read after 24 and 48 h of incubation. For selected strains, susceptibility to linezolid was also investigated using the VITEK\u00ae 2 AST P631 card for comparison with agar diffusion methods.\n\n5.3. DNA Extraction, Analysis of the Staphylococcal Protein A (spa) Locus and Multi Locus Sequence Typing\n\nDNA extraction was performed as previously described [42]. All strains were submitted to the amplification of the Staphylococcus protein A (spa) repeat region according to the spa typing website (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/, accessed on 20 February 2021) developed by Ridom GmbH and curated by SeqNet.org (http://www.SeqNet.org/, accessed on 20 February 2021) [43]. Amplification products were subjected to electrophoresis for 2 h at 100 V in a 2% agarose gel in 0.5\u00d7 Tris-Borate-EDTA gel. Amplification product size defines a spa profile that allowed a first stage of longitudinal screening of the entire strain collection. Selected strains (strains of each spa profile and multiple strains for each spa profile) were analyzed by spa typing as previously described to validate the spa screening approach [43]. Ridom StaphType\u2122 software (Ridom GmbH, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) was used for spa sequence analysis. Sequence Type (ST) was determined for selected strains after Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), either according to Enright et al. and Cris\u00f3stomo et al. [44,45] or after whole genome sequencing (wgMLST).\n\n5.4. Determining the Rrn Copy Number\n\nMacrorestriction of genomic DNA embedded in agarose plugs followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described using I-CeuI, an intron-encoded endonuclease that cleaves a specific 19-bp sequence in the 23S rRNA gene [46].\n\n5.5. Whole Genome Sequencing\n\nSeventeen whole genome sequences (WGSs) were selected among the WGSs available for MRSA strains of both patients as follows: nine WGSs for P1 (strains isolated from six samples between 2007 and 2016, including two LRSA isolated in 2016) and eight WGSs for P2 (strains isolated from four samples from 2007 to 2016, including two LRSA isolated in 2016). WGSs were obtained by an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Read quality was checked by FastQC [47], de novo assembled with SPAdes 3.12.0 [48] and annotated with Prokka 1.14.5 [49]. Pan-genome analysis was carried out using Roary 3.13.0 [50]. This whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession numbers JAGPWI000000000 to JAGPWK000000000 and JAGPWM000000000 to JAGPWZ000000000. The version described in this paper is version JAGPWI010000000 to JAGPWK010000000 and JAGPWM010000000 to JAGPWZ010000000. Sequence Read Archive accession number is PRJNA721116. Characteristics of the draft genome sequences are given in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nLRE-finder was used to detect linezolid resistance genetic support and estimate the proportions of mutant vs. wild-type alleles in the 23S rRNA gene [51]. The latter data were used together with the number of 23S rRNA gene copies found in the strains under investigation to estimate the numbers of wild-type vs. mutated copies [52].

As the disease progressed, further narrowing of the vessels made the clinical picture to look closer to ischemic bowel pathology as the patient developed a top surgical emergency (i.e. bowel perforation). Such pathological finding (IMHMV) can only be diagnosed in a fully prepared tissue histology, but rather be considered when no other consistent alternative diagnosis was found.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe treating physicians must definitely consider the possibility of idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins when similar manifestations are encountered in biopsy specimens of old cases with suspected inflammatory bowel disease or non-occlusive ischemia of the distal colorectum.\n\nTEXT:\n1 Introduction\n\nIdiopathic Myointimal Hyperplasia of the Mesenteric Veins (IMHMV) is a poorly understood disease condition that poses diagnostic challenge to clinicians and pathologists. It is described as an ischemic bowel disease without the presence of a thrombus along with venous occlusion caused by proliferation of the smooth muscles in the tunica intima of the veins [1]. Clinically and endoscopically, IMHMV is usually misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition of the bowel, similar to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with same clinical features [2]. Therefore, definitive diagnosis is possible only after surgery as biopsy is not capable of distinguishing the ischemic abnormalities from those associated with e known IBD manifestations [3]. Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of the mesenteric veins mostly involves the thickening of small and medium-sized mesenteric veins with the hallmark manifestation of intimal smooth muscle proliferation resulting in luminal occlusion and mucosal ischemic changes [3].\n\nVascular modifications involve clustered, dilated or arterialized capillaries, sub-endothelial fibrin deposits, and many fibrin thrombi in ulcerated and non-ulcerated mucosae [4]. The first case of IMHMV was described in the medical literature in 1991 by Genta and Haggit, who described 4 male patients with segmental ischemic colitis due to idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches [5]. Since then, few cases have been reported describing this entity with different clinical presentations, however, the etiology and pathogenesis of these vascular modifications remain unclear. Majority of these cases ultimately end up with different degrees of bowel resection [4]. Usually, mistaken for inflammatory bowel disease, the means of definitive diagnosis for bowel ischemia and venous thrombotic disease are the pathological changes taking place, as preoperative radiological and clinical methods fail to distinguish it from these bowel and systemic diseases. To the best of our knowledge, roughly 34 cases of IMHMV have been reported in the literature with this being the 35th case.\n\nWe herein describe the case of a male patient with idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of the mesenteric veins (IMHMV) with spontaneous double perforation of the colon (descending colon and sigmoid colon) associated with a year long history of what was thought to be inflammatory bowel disease, Ulcerative colitis (IBD).\n\nThis case report has been reported in accordance with the SCARE Criteria [6].\n\n2 Case presentation\n\nA 55-year-old male patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain was admitted to the hospital with chief complaints of severe abdominal pain for the past 10\u00a0days. The pain was continuous in nature and persisted throughout the day. There was history of loss of appetite, weight loss of nearly 4\u00a0kg over a period of 1\u00a0week and passing blood-stained stools occasionally. There was no history of any joint pain, skin lesions, fever or conjunctivitis, chest pain, cough and contact with a COVID-19 case. He is a known case of type \u22122 diabetes mellitus on oral hypoglycemic medications. Approximately 15\u00a0years back, he was admitted for left-sided lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with pulmonary embolism for which he was on warfarin for a year. His brother had a history of esophageal carcinoma.\n\nThe physical examination showed a non-distended, non-tender abdomen. However, the bowel sounds were exaggerated. Vital parameters were normal. Following Laboratory findings were reported: Increased Inflammatory markers with elevated, CRP\u00a0=\u00a0179.07, WBC\u00a0=\u00a021.68, Hg\u00a0=\u00a012.50, platelets\u00a0=\u00a0287.00 and neutrophil\u00a0=\u00a019.67. Fecal calprotectin was 877.8\u00a0\u03bcg/g.\n\nColonoscopy was performed, which revealed a congested and inflamed rectal mucosa (Fig. 1). Salt and pepper appearance was seen in the sigmoid region and the mucosa bled on touch. The transverse colon showed a whitish appearance with loss of vasculature. Biopsy findings showed mixed inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and the cells were negative for granuloma, dysplasia or malignancy, and there was no evidence of crypt abscess and distortion. None of the findings were specific for Ulcerative colitis.Fig. 1 Colonoscopy images showing congested mucosa in sigmoid (Top-left) and whitish appearance indicating loss of vasculature in transverse colon suggestive of IBD.\n\nFig. 1\n\nFollowed by the colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and the pelvis was done with suspicion of complications. However, CT findings revealed diffuse circumferential thickening of the sigmoid and descending colon associated with pericolic and pelvic stranding reaction that was suggestive of infective/inflammatory left-sided colitis. Based on the presentation along with the investigations, he was diagnosed to be a suspected case of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and was started on prednisolone 30\u00a0mg once daily, Adalimumab, oral 5-Amino salicylic acid, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and then later on he was discharged. Two weeks post-discharge, he had complaints of fever, constipation, decreased oral intake along with lower right and left quadrant abdominal pain of 8/10 severity without vomiting or diarrhea. He was treated as an outpatient and was scheduled for day-case Flexible sigmoidoscopy which revealed severely inflamed mucosa with pseudo polyps that caused significant narrowing of the lumen (Fig. 2). Multiple biopsies were taken to rule out dysplasia.Fig. 2 Flexible sigmoidoscopy images showing severely inflamed mucosa (Top-left) with pseudo-polyps (top-right) with significant narrowing of the lumen (bottom-left and -right).\n\nFig. 2\n\nAlmost 2\u00a0months later, the patient got readmitted to the hospital with severe abdominal pain and fever for 2\u00a0days associated with a weight loss of around 12\u00a0kg in 2\u00a0months. The patient's appearance was uncomfortable with normal vital parameters. Physical examination of the abdomen showed a non-distended mild tenderness. Laboratory reports were WBC\u00a0=\u00a013.37, NEU\u00a0=\u00a078.30, hemoglobin\u00a0=\u00a013.90 and C - reactive protein\u00a0=\u00a0179.07. He was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and intravenous hydrocortisone as flare-up of the underlying disease was suspected. Over the next 3\u00a0days, the patient failed to show any significant improvement along with a proportionate increase in the abdominal pain, watery blood-stained stool, tachycardia and hypotension. However, there was no fever. To rule out any new bowel-related complications, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed which had similar findings of previous CT and there was no evidence of bowel perforation. Blood works and Clostridium difficile toxin screen was done and was positive (Fig. 3).Fig. 3 Contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen, abdominal and lung windows are shown. Red arrows denote the areas of pneumoperitoneum.\n\nOperation report:\n\nIntraoperative findings:\n\nSevere colitis with a scattered area of dusky patches along with the bowel, extending from the upper rectum to mid of transverse colon with perforations at 2 sites (one in sigmoid and another one in descending colon below the splenic flexure). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nFig. 3\n\nIt was decided to follow him with a conservative management approach, but the symptoms never subsided. Rather abdominal pain got aggravated and the abdomen was distended two days later. Tenderness was present all over the abdomen with rebound tenderness and an X-ray was done which showed free air under the diaphragm. CT scan was repeated to re-evaluate the presence of any perforation and the findings demonstrated circumferential thickening of the descending colon with a small air locule traversing the wall of the lower part of descending colon and a large air pocket adjacent to sigmoid colon depicting the perforated bowels. It was decided to proceed with a left colectomy and Hartman's procedure (Fig. 4).Fig. 4 Intra-operative findings: Blue arrow: descending colon perforation, Green arrow, Sigmoid colon perforation. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nFig. 4\n\nLeft hemicolectomy and Hartman's procedure were performed. Surgical specimens from mid of transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid up to mid rectum were sent for examination.\n\nHistopathological findings showed colon segment with a concentric proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the intima and media of small to medium-sized intramural veins. The arteries appeared normal. The mucosa showed dilated capillaries, focal small muscular vessels with thickened hyaline walls, and extensive ischemic changes with ulceration. No evidence of thrombosis or malignancy. The features were consistent with venous insufficiency due to idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia. And the final diagnosis was confirmed as Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins (IMHMV) with perforation.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nIdiopathic myointimal hyperplasia is a rare cause of intestinal ischemia. As compared to other inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of the mesenteric veins (IMHMV) is not caused by arterial thromboembolism, venous thrombus or vasculitis such that its etiology remains poorly understood. Given that the case presented with double perforation in the colon with a year long history of presumed ulcerative colitis (UC) and the similarity of clinical manifestations of idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins and ulcerative colitis, the histological manifestations were completely distinct and dissimilar. The former often results in mucosal modifications due to non-specific ischemic injury than an immune-mediated inflammatory process with the absence of plasma cell-rich inflammation [4].\n\nEvidence showed that most of the affected cases are middle-aged, previously healthy males without prior gastrointestinal complaints but presenting with recurrent, progressive abdominal pain accompanied by bloody diarrhea. Similar findings were encountered in this case [4]. Symptoms start with mild cramping pain and loose stools that progress over a variable duration (months or years), and finally result in a severe recurrent pain with hematochezia which was the presentation in our patient [4]. The non-specific presenting symptoms include bloody diarrhea, lower abdominal pain and weight loss resulting in misdiagnosis of ulcerative colitis [7]. Our patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis associated with pulmonary embolism which is explained by previous studies reporting cardiovascular risk factors commonly seen in many cases [2,[7], [8], [9]].\n\nAlthough majority of the cases involve the recto-sigmoid colon, extension of the disease proximally along with the descending colon to involve the jejunum, ileum, and entire colon sparing the rectum is also seen [3]. In the present case, the mucosa showed dilated capillaries, focal small muscular vessels with thickened hyaline walls and extensive ischemic changes with ulceration. Evidence showed that idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins can also affect the mucosa. This seems to be characteristic of the disease where veins in the colonic submucosa and muscularis propria are also involved [5]. A study conducted by Abu Alfa and his colleagues on a patient with idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins showed that biopsy analysis revealed the presence of thick-walled hyalinized vessels [10].\n\nOther recent studies have also reported In accordance with their findings, we also noted the presence of focal small muscular vessels with thickened hyaline walls.\n\nCharacteristic manifestations include radiographically evident structures of the distal colorectum combined to mucosal friability, ulcers, and pseudo polyps similar to the features of the inflammatory bowel disease following which the patient was treated with corticosteroid therapy prior to definitive surgical management.\n\nAbsence of concrete histopathological criteria for definitive diagnosis of IMHMV makes the biopsy-based diagnosis a challenge for the pathologists resulting in early initiation of treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs rather than surgery, which at present is the only effective treatment for this condition that has been reported to be completely curative. Hence, those who underwent surgery are predisposed to a higher risk of developing intestinal perforation, specifically if they received corticosteroid therapy for a presumptive diagnosis of ulcerative colitis [4,5]. This might possibly explain the double perforation in the colon that was reported after a year long history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nThe present case report describes a male patient with an Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins (IMHMV) with perforation with the presence of mesenteric veins in the mucosa. It must be noted that treating physicians must consider the possibility of idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins when similar manifestations are encountered in biopsy specimens of old cases with suspected inflammatory bowel disease or non-occlusive ischemia of the distal colorectum.\n\nProvenance and peer review\n\nNot commissioned, externally peer-reviewed.\n\nInformed consent\n\nThe study participant was at negligible risk.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nLongitudinal dynamics of gut bacteriome, mycobiome and virome after fecal microbiota transplantation in graft-versus-host disease.\n\nABSTRACT:\nFecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has emerged as a potential treatment for severe colitis associated with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Bacterial engraftment from FMT donor to recipient has been reported, however the fate of fungi and viruses after FMT remains unclear. Here we report longitudinal dynamics of the gut bacteriome, mycobiome and virome in a teenager with GvHD after receiving four doses of FMT at weekly interval. After serial FMTs, the gut bacteriome, mycobiome and virome of the patient differ from compositions before FMT with variable temporal dynamics. Diversity of the gut bacterial community increases after each FMT. Gut fungal community initially shows expansion of several species followed by a decrease in diversity after multiple FMTs. In contrast, gut virome community varies substantially over time with a stable rise in diversity. The bacterium, Corynebacterium jeikeium, and Torque teno viruses, decrease after FMTs in parallel with an increase in the relative abundance of Caudovirales bacteriophages. Collectively, FMT may simultaneously impact on the various components of the gut microbiome with distinct effects.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\nAllogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) is a promising therapy for hematological disorders, however, 35\u201345% of recipients experience serious complications arising from allo-HSCT. These complications, termed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), is associated with up to 25% mortality1\u20133. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in the gut microbiota composition are associated with the occurrence of GvHD1. Multiple factors contributed to reduced microbiota diversity in patients with allo-HSCT, including recurrent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation, and altered nutritional status1. In murine and human studies, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) led to a loss of overall bacterial diversity, expansion of Lactobacillales and loss of Clostridiales4,5. Alterations in the gut viral community are also associated with enteric GVHD6,7. For instance, human herpesvirus 6 was detected in blood6,7, and picornaviruses were detected in stools of patients with acute GvHD post HSCT8.\n\nFecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the administration of fecal suspensions from healthy donors into a patient\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, is an effective bacteriotherapy in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections9. FMT has been shown to be associated with restoration of diversity of gut bacterial community. Recently, small case series of up to four subjects have used FMT as a treatment for refractory GvHD10,11. FMT was associated with improved gastrointestinal symptoms, reduced diarrhea and alterations in the gut microbiota in patients with refractory enteric GvHD3,12.\n\nWhilst larger clinical studies are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of FMT for GvHD, this life-threatening disease requires immediate attention in some patients. Most studies have focused on restoration of bacterial diversity and little is known of the role of gut fungi and viruses in FMT. Two studies recently reported that Candida albicans and bacteriophages influenced FMT efficacy in recurrent Clostridium difficile infections, suggesting that alterations in gut viruses and fungi in response to FMT are also important for treatment outcomes13,14.\n\nHere, we investigate the longitudinal dynamics of the gut bacteriome (bacterial microbiome), mycobiome (fungal microbiome) and virome (viral microbiome) in a teenager with stage IV GvHD with four doses of FMT at weekly interval. Apart from 16\u2009S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics sequencing for bacteriome profiling, we enhance fungal extraction and enrich virus like particles (VLPs) in fecal DNA preparations and perform deep metagenomic sequencing on the fungi-enriched and viruses-enriched DNA extractions respectively, to profile the gut mycobiome and virome. We show discrepant alteration patterns of the gut bacteriome, mycobiome and virome in the recipient after FMT.\n\nResults\nClinical characteristics of patient with severe GvHD receiving FMT\nA 14-year-old male suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome with monosomy 7 underwent human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling allo-HSCT. The patient developed stage II skin GvHD (rash 25\u201350%), stage IV gut GvHD with profuse bloody diarrhea and significant functional impairment and overall grade IV life threatening GvHD shortly after allo-HSCT. The patient failed to respond to methylprednisolone, Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine A, infliximab, ruxolitinib and entocort (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). Computed tomography imaging showed significant thickening of the small bowel and colon suggestive of severe intestinal inflammation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). He received the first FMT (day 0), 77 days after allo-HSCT, followed by three additional FMTs at weekly interval after the first FMT (Fig.\u00a01a). The first three FMTs were performed using stool from a single donor (D8) and the fourth FMT from a different donor (D4). The antibiotic history of the patient is shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b.Fig. 1 Study schematic and clinical outcome.\na GvHD patient received four FMTs.

One biological sample was examined over one experiment.\n\n\n\nIncreased diversity of gut bacterial microbiota after FMT\nWe assessed alterations in the gut bacterial community in the patient before and after FMTs using 16\u2009S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Changes in alpha diversity and community composition over time are summarized in Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c. Before FMT, only two exact sequence variants (ESVs) identified as Corynebacterium were detected in the patient\u2019s stools. This observation corresponded with alpha diversity metrics showing low species richness and diversity relative to donor and post FMT samples (Fig.\u00a02a). On day one immediately after the first FMT, four Bacteroides and nine Enterococcus ESVs previously undetected in the patient\u2019s stool became dominant and Corynebacterium was no longer detectable (Fig.\u00a02c). Interestingly, most of these 13 ESVs were either absent or below detection in the corresponding donor (D8) stool. The Bacteroides ESVs persisted in the patient\u2019s stools throughout the five days, whereas the Enterococcus ESVs generally declined to undetectable levels, most around day 3. Similarly, two other Bacteroides and one Bifidobacterium ESV detected in the donor stool (D8 lots 26 and 27, Fig.\u00a02c) steadily declined in the patient from day 1 onwards. This loss of ESVs was reflected in the community alpha diversity in which richness and diversity declined after day 2 (Fig.\u00a02a). These findings suggest that the gut microbiota of the patient may be altered as early as one day after FMT, and that not all donor microorganisms could establish colonization in the recipient.Fig. 2 Changes in gut bacterial community composition in GvHD patient after FMTs.\na Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity of bacterial communities in donor stools and the patient before and after FMTs. b Principal coordinate analysis (PCOA) of bacterial community composition in the patient following FMT based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. c Heat map summarizing fecal bacterial community composition in donor stools and the patient. Increasing relative abundances are representing by lighter colors (black to yellow). Taxonomic labels on left of figure indicate phylum assignments (class-level for Proteobacteria), labels on right indicate genus. Pre-FMT represents stool sample collected before the first FMT. FMT1, FMT2, FMT3, and FMT4 represent stool samples collected after the 1st (days 1\u20135), 2nd (day 6\u201313), 3rd (day 14\u201325) and 4th (day 27\u2013120) FMTs respectively. D8-26, D8-27, D8-28, D8-29, D8-34 indicate fecal samples collected from donor D8 on different days, whereas only one fecal sample collected from donor D4 was used in the FMT. FMT1, FMT2, FMT3, FMT4 were performed using D8-26 and D8-27, D8-28 and D8-29, D8-34, D4 respectively. All analyses were based on bacterial profiles from 16\u2009S rRNA gene sequencing data.\n\n\n\nAfter the second FMT using different stool from the same donor (D8), the richness and diversity of the patient\u2019s gut bacteriome increased (Fig.\u00a02a). This time, a larger variety of Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria ESVs were detected in the patient immediately after the second transplant (day 7), and most persisted until the end of the study (Fig.\u00a02c). These observations suggest that the first FMT may have a priming effect on the patient\u2019s gut community, allowing donor microorganisms from the second FMT to colonize the recipient. Two additional FMTs were subsequently given with stool from a second donor (D4) to increase diversity of microorganisms. After the third FMT, there were no major alterations in the alpha diversity or the composition of the patient\u2019s gut bacteriome, compared to that after the first two transplants (Fig.\u00a02a, c). A number of Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium ESVs from the fourth donor stool (donor D4) became established in the patient\u2019s gut (Fig.\u00a02c). Overall changes of the patient\u2019s gut bacteriome were depicted via principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). The first two FMTs was associated with large shifts as shown by clustering of day 1\u20135 and day 7\u201313 profiles to the exclusion of samples from subsequent days (Fig.\u00a02b), which was also reflected by the alpha diversity values in which community richness and diversity of the patient\u2019s stool stabilized after the second FMT (Fig.\u00a02a). Stool bacterial communities from day 67 onward appeared to cluster away from samples immediately following the fourth FMT, suggestive of fluctuations in the patient\u2019s gut microbial communities. Nevertheless, these post-FMT mcirobiome profiles did not resemble disease baseline microbiome profile (day 0 before FMT).\n\nTo gain high-resolution insight into the bacterial microbiota, a subset of samples were analyzed by metagenomic sequencing and the results showed similar alterations with that measured via 16\u2009S rRNA sequencing after FMT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Three predominant species were detected in the recipient\u2019s stool after FMTs, including Alistipes putredinis, Clostridium nexile and Ruminococcus gnavu (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03).\n\nImproved gut microbiome functionality after FMT\nWe next investigated functional alterations in the bacterial community following FMTs, total bulk DNA sequencing reads from the metagenomic dataset were queried against reference databases to identify genes and their corresponding metabolic pathways (MetaCyc annotation). In the stool collected at baseline (day 0 before FMT), a large proportion of sequences could not be classified (>95% unmapped, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). The richness of genes and pathways showed no great difference between donors and patient before and after FMT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). However, Shannon and Simpson diversity of the genes and pathways in the patient were markedly lower than that in donor (Fig.\u00a03a), which is consistent with a low taxonomic diversity (Fig.\u00a02a). After the first FMT, there was a substantial increase in the proportion of classifiable genes and pathways (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). In contrast to taxonomic reconstitution in which only several ESVs from the genera Bacteroides and Enterococcus were detected in the patient (Fig.\u00a02c), Shannon and Simpson diversity of genes and pathways were increased after the first FMT (Fig.\u00a03a), and the overall functional gene composition was comparable to the donors (Fig.\u00a03b). After the second FMT, the diversity of genes and pathway remained stable until the last follow-up, accompanied by an increase in the bacterial diversity at the taxonomical level. After FMT, genes and pathways primarily related to metabolisms of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides and energy were restored (Fig.\u00a03c). These findings suggest that functions of microbial community might be promptly reconstructed following FMT with less fluctuations in functional content when compared with taxonomic configuration.Fig. 3 Changes in bacterial community function in GvHD patient associated with FMTs.\na \u03b1-diversity (Shannon and Simpson diversity) plot of gene families and pathways. These values were calculated based on gene and pathway relative abundances. b Principal coordinate analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities based on abundances of functional pathways detected in donor and patient stools.

FMT1, FMT2, FMT3, and FMT4 represent stool samples collected after the 1st (day 1-5), 2nd (day 7-13), 3rd (day 15-25) and 4th (day 27-120) FMTs respectively. c Heat map summarizing changes in patient\u2019s gut microbial community function following FMT. Pathways with higher relative abundances are shaded red, whereas pathways with low relative abundances are shaded blue.\n\n\n\nDurable engraftment of donor-derived fungi after FMT\nTo characterize the changes of the gut mycobiota in the patient following multiple FMTs, we performed fungi-enriched fecal DNA extraction, ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing and profiled the fungal composition. Overall, the patient showed a decrease in the richness (Chao1) and diversity (both Shannon and Simpson indices) of the gut mycobiome after FMT (Fig.\u00a04a). The fecal mycobiome compositions at later time points after serial FMTs were comparable to the fecal mycobiomes of the donor D8 (D8-26 and D8-34) (Fig.\u00a04b).Fig. 4 Changes in gut fungal community composition in GvHD patient after FMTs.\na Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity of fungal communities in donor stools and the patient before and after FMTs. b PCoA ordination based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities of the patient\u2019s gut mycobiota showing progression over time. Dots represent samples labeled according to their respective time-points and are colored to visually group samples according to FMT timeline. c Proportion of fungal taxa derived from donors in total taxa in patient\u2019s stool samples. The proportion was calculated by using the method of fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST). d Species-level proportions of the fecal mycobiota in donors and the patient before and after FMT. The markedly altered species were highlighted in red color. One biological sample was examined over one experiment.\n\n\n\nWe further investigated the proportion of recipient fungal community that was derived from donors by fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST). Donor derived fungi instantly took up a proportion as high as 71% in the recipient\u2019s mycobiome on day 1 after FMT (Fig.\u00a04c), followed by a decrease down to 10.3% on day 5, indicating that most of fungal taxa showed transient colonization in the recipient. With subsequent FMTs, the proportion of donor-derived fungal taxa continued to rise followed by a marked decline to 4% on day 120 which suggest that only limited fungal taxa from donors have sustained engraftment in the recipient.\n\nAt the taxonomy level, the species Parastagonospora nodorum and Thielavia terrestris significantly dominated the patient\u2019s fungal community before FMT but were deceased following FMT (Fig.\u00a04d). Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which dominated the donors\u2019 fungal community, expanded rapidly on day 1 after the first FMT and decreased after the third FMT in the patient. In contrast, Candida dubliniensis was increased after FMT and remained stable until the last follow up. After the third FMT, Sporisorium reilianum derived from the donor showed high abundance in the patient\u2019s gut after the third FMT but was depleted after the fourth FMT (on day 35 since the first FMT). This was concomitant with a post-FMT recovery of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which showed a high relative abundance before FMT. We further performed quantitative PCR on a subset of these significantly altered species, Parastagonospora nodorum, Thielavia terrestris, Candida dubliniensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Consistent with the sequencing results, Parastagonospora nodorum and Thielavia terrestris were significantly decreased, Candida dubliniensis was increased, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae was transiently expanded in the feces of the patient after FMT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). These findings suggest that FMT may be associated with an expansion of multiple fungal taxa, rather than a recovery of fungal diversity.\n\nTo exclude possibility of fungal contamination, we sequenced negative control samples during DNA extraction. The most abundance species in negative controls, such as Talaromyces pinophilus, Cryptococcum neoformans and Alternaria solani, were not detected in any patient\u2019s or in donors\u2019 stool samples (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). Moreover, the significantly altered species, Parastagonospora nodorum, Thielavia terrestris, Candida dubliniensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were not detected in the negative control samples by quantitative PCR (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). These results suggest that the fungal alteration findings reported here are unlikely to be the result of contamination.\n\nVariable and stable increase in virome diversity after FMT\nTo characterize alteration in the gut virome, we enriched virus like particles (VLPs) in stool samples and subsequently performed deep metagenomic sequencing on the VLP DNA. The patient\u2019s virome exhibited a high degree of variability in virome diversity over time (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a) and the overall community composition structure after FMT did not resemble that of the donors\u2019 with the exception at day 15 after the third FMT and at day 35, 48 and 67 after the fourth FMT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08b). We further investigated the proportion of viruses that was derived from donors in the recipient after FMT. Donor\u2019s viruses gradually took up greater proportions in recipient after each FMT (Fig.\u00a05a). Less than 2% of the recipient\u2019s viral taxa was transferred from donor after the first and second FMTs, whereas after the third FMT, the proportion of donor-derived viral taxa was increased up to 29% by months 3.Fig. 5 Changes in gut viral communities in GvHD patient after FMTs.\na Proportion of viral taxa derived from donors in total taxa in patient\u2019s stool samples. The proportion was calculated by using the method of fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST).

The abundance of selected species in a given sample is color-intensified according to the row z-score value, as indicated in the color bar. Blue to red color shades indicate increasing relative abundances.\n\n\n\nAt day 0, the virome predominantly was comprised of eukaryotic viruses (99.99% of total mapped reads) and few phage reads were detected (0.01%). After the first and second FMT, more than 99% of virus sequences detected were still eukaryotic viruses. Most of the reads were identified as Torque teno virus (Fig.\u00a05c, relative abundance 99.67% in patient versus 0.0834% in donors). This eukaryotic virus, Torque teno virus, maintained high relative abundance in the gut virome after the first and second FMT but was substantially reduced after the third and fourth FMT to an average relative abundance of 53.72% over the period of day 27 to 120. The abundance of Torque teno virus in the feces of patients and donors were further quantified by qPCR, which showed a 2000-fold higher presence in the patient before FMT than that in donors. However, it was decreased shortly after each FMT, and finally maintained at lower levels after 31 day post the first FMT (average 150-fold decrease over the period of day 31 to day 120), compared to the baseline level in the patient before FMT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). We reported alterations of the most dominant 50 eukaryotic viral species following FMT, and found that eukaryotic viruses other than Torque teno virus were presented in low abundances and did not display significant changes up to three months after FMT (Fig.\u00a05f).\n\nThe relative abundances of phages (prokaryotic viruses) elevated since the third FMT and reached to 41.82% on day 120 after the first FMT (Fig.\u00a05b). Along with slow increases in the relative abundance of phages over the treatment period, a substantial increase in phage diversity was also observed in the patient\u2019s gut virome after the first FMT (Fig.\u00a05d). Members of the bacteriophage lineage Microviridae occupied a large proportion of the patient\u2019s prokaryotic virome before FMT (88.13% in relative abundance), but was subsequently replaced (<10% average relative abundance after FMT) by Caudovirales (11.86% in relative abundance before FMT, >90% in final sample) (Fig.\u00a05e). At the species level, the patient\u2019s prokaryotic viral community was dominated by Parabacteroides phage YZ-2015a (74.3%) and Parabacteroides phage YZ-2015a (13.9%), which both decreased to 0% on day 120 after FMT. After the second FMT, five Enterobacteria phage taxa, one Escherichia phage, two Stx2 converting phage and one Shigella virus were expanded transiently, but were depleted after the forth FMT. In contrast, the five Enterococcus phage taxa maintained at a high relative abundance from day 67 to 120 (Fig.\u00a05g). To exclude the possibility of contamination, we sequenced a negative control sample (reagent control) during VLP extraction and amplification. Only five species were detected in the negative control, which collectively took up <0.4% of the virome across donors and recipient samples (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). These data suggest that viral alterations reported here are unlikely to be the result of contamination.\n\nDiscussion\nResident members of the gut microbiota including bacteria, fungi and viruses are intimately linked with host immunity and human health15,16. The basis for FMT is to alter these microorganisms and their interactions by replacing a \u201cdysbiotic\u201d gut microbiota with \u201chealthy\u201d microbes to treat gut and other non-gut diseases. GvHD is traditionally considered as an immunological disease but can be treated by FMT with promising outcomes10,11. Previous reports have focused on the bacterial community after FMT in GvHD10,11, whereas the role of gut fungi, viruses in GvHD remain unknown.\n\nOur previous study reported that Candida albicans and bacteriophages can impact FMT efficacy in recurrent Clostridium difficile infections13,14. Here, we investigated longitudinal dynamics of the gut bacterial, fungal, and\u00a0viral communities in a GvHD patient treated with multiple FMTs. We found that the bacterial, fungal, and viral communities responded differently to FMT; The bacterial community in the recipient was gradually recovered with an increased diversity after each FMT, the fungal community showed expansion of several species followed by a decrease in diversity, whereas the viral community varied substantially in composition after multiple FMTs with a stable rise in virome diversity.\n\nInitially, the GvHD patient\u2019s gut bacterial microbiota was characterized by a low diversity, and dominated by Corynebacterium jeikeium, which has been reported to be associated with bacteremia in catheter manipulation17. Given the toxin-producing capability of Corynebacterium which may lead to diarrhea, we performed PCR to identify diphtheria toxin encoding genes in the patient\u2019s fecal microbiome before FMT. We found absence of diphtheria toxin encoding genes, indicating that the diarrhea in the patient might not be caused by Corynebacterium GI infection but by GvHD (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011).\n\nGut bacterial-fungal interactions is important in maintaining mucosa homeostasis18. In our study, the mycobiota change is opposite to the bacterial microbiota change. We were unable to determine whether the decreased mycobiota diversity is a result of reconstitution of microbial taxa, replacement of donor\u2019s fungal community, or a recovered host immune system. Nonetheless, several fungal species were increased after FMT, such as Candida dubliniensis and Sporisorium reilianum. Alterations of fungal composition associated with FMT warrant further mechanistic investigations to delineate their significance and implications in disease outcomes.\n\nBoth eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA viruses (mostly phages) are constituents of the human gut microbiota, where eukaryotic DNA viruses are minor components compared to bacteriophages19. However, we found a substantial presence of eukaryotic viruses relative to bacteriophages in the patient prior to FMT, whereby the use of immunosuppressants may be associated with the expansion of Torque teno virus20. Torque teno virus was previously reported to be increased in GvHD patient21,22, but it is uncertain whether it associates with occurrence and/or cure of GvHD.\n\nFMT was associated with an increase in the richness of viruses and the ratio of bacteriophages to eukaryotic viruses in the patient\u2019s gut virome. However, the enrichment and/or depletion of exact viral taxa associated with recovery remains to be investigated. Caudovirales bacteriophages were overrepresented in patients with Clostridium difficile infections and were significantly reduced by FMT13. Whereas here we observed a reverse trend of FMT enriching Caudovirales phages in the GvHD patient. As the role of viruses in FMT has not been well studied, future research should focus on changes in the viral community and their relationship with FMT efficacy. Moreover, we did not study RNA viruses which could be potentially important as well in FMT. Such information will be crucial in understanding and enhancing the safety and efficacy of FMT for the treatment of various diseases. The observational nature of this single case precludes generalization of our findings and further larger sample-sized studies are needed to validate the present findings.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides novel insight into alterations of the gut microbiome in GvHD following multiple FMTs. We showed that bacterial, fungal and viral communities responded differently to FMTs. Future FMT practice should consider the role and importance of reconstituting the gut fungi and viruses.\n\nMethods\nEthics statement\nThis study was approved by Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (The Joint CUHK-NTEC CREC, CREC Ref. No.: 2017.260 and 2018.443, Clinical Trial registry, NCT04014413). The patient and his guardians consented to participate in this study and agreed for publication of research results.\n\nPreparation of donor stools for FMT\nDonor stools were obtained from the stool bank of Center for Gut Microbiota Research. To ensure donors were healthy and fit for stool donation, donors were first screened using a questionnaire followed by stool and blood tests to rule out any infectious disease such as HIV, hepatitis B or C, syphilis or any communicable diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or gastrointestinal malignancy. Shortly after donors provided stool at the Prince of Wales Hospital, samples were diluted with sterile saline (0.9%). This solution was blended and strained through a filter to remove particulate matter. The resulting supernatant was then stored as frozen FMT solutions.\n\nStudy subject and design\nA 14-year-old male suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome with monosomy 7 underwent HLA-identical sibling allo-HSCT. The patient developed itchy erythematous and maculopapular skin rash over all limbs and body covering 50% of body surface area from Day 14 post-transplant (Day -63, Fig.\u00a01a) and at the time of neutrophil engraftment. The clinical picture was compatible with stage 2 skin GvHD according to the Glucksberg clinical stage of acute GvHD. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 2\u2009mg/kg/day with clinical response and the skin rash gradually subsided after steroid treatment. However, at the time of tapering of steroid to 1\u2009mg/kg/day on Day 31 post-transplant (Day -46, Fig.\u00a01a), the patient developed severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. The watery diarrhea progressed to bloody diarrhea despite aggressive immunosuppressive treatment. CT scan showed abnormal mucosal enhancement and diffuse long segment inflammatory changes in the small bowel involving whole length of ileum and jejunum with intraluminal hyperdense content consistent with hemorrhage. The large bowel also showed increase in wall thickening and mucosal stratification (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Sigmoidoscopy showed hemorrhage in the large colon with mucosal sloughing hence biopsies were not taken due to increased risk of perforation. All infective pathogens including clostridium difficile toxins were excluded in stool and the overall diagnosis was compatible with gastrointestinal GvHD.\n\nThe patient was administered four FMTs, and recovery was monitored through subsequent clinical follow-ups (Fig.\u00a01a). Firstly, a pre-FMT stool sample was obtained from the patient on day 0. FMTs were then administered to the patient on day 0, day 5, day 13 and day 25 of the study. We used five stool samples (D8-26, D8-27, D8-28, D8-29, D8-34) from one donor (D8) and one stool sample from another donor (D4). The first, second, third and fourth FMTs were performed using D8-26 and D8-27, D8-28 and D8-29, D8-34, and D4 stools, respectively. During the FMT procedure, 100\u2009ml of FMT solution was infused over 2\u20133\u2009min into the distal duodenum or jejunum of the patient via oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (OGD). Post-FMT stools were collected daily from day 1 to day 36, and every half month after the fourth FMT until day 120. The FMT treatment in this patient was experimental. The study complied with the CONSORT guidelines of N-of-1 clinical trial, and pre-specified outcomes related to this patient as part of the broader trial (NCT04014413) will be reported upon trial completion.\n\n16\u2009S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis\nThe total DNA was extracted from around 0.1\u2009g of stool using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen catalog number 12888-100) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Extracted fecal DNA was used as template in a two-step PCR to amplify the V3 and V4 regions of the 16\u2009S gene. Briefly, PCR reactions were performed in 25\u2009\u00b5l reactions containing 1X PCR buffer, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2\u2009mM of each dNTP, 0.2\u2009\u00b5M of each forward (341\u2009F: CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) (Klindworth et al., 2013) and reverse (806\u2009R: GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT) (Apprill et al., 2015) primers, 0.625 U HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase (Qiagen catalog number 203605), 1\u2009\u00b5l template DNA and molecular biology grade water. Thermocycler settings were as follows: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min, followed by 15 cycles of 94\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, 55\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, and then 10 cycles of 94\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, and finally 72\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The second PCR to ligate sequencing adapters and barcodes to amplicons from the first PCR were performed in 25\u2009\u00b5l reactions with the following recipe: 1X PCR buffer, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2\u2009mM of each dNTP, 0.2\u2009mM each of Nextera index 1 and 2 primers, 0.1\u2009\u00b5M each of forward and reverse Golay indexes, 0.625 U HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase, 1\u2009\u00b5l template DNA from the first PCR and molecular biology grade water. Thermocycler settings were 95\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, followed by seven cycles of 98\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009s, 63\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, and finally 72\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. PCR amplicons were checked on an agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen catalog number 28706). Purified final products were sent to the Genomics Resource Core Facility at Cornell University for 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009300\u2009bp sequencing in an Illumina MiSeq using the v3 Miseq Reagent Kit. Demultiplexed raw sequence data were imported into QIIME2 v2018.6 (https://qiime2.org/). Using the DADA2 workflow23 in QIIME2, PCR primer and low-quality sequences were trimmed, and remaining reads subsequently denoised and merged. Alpha diversity statistics were calculated using representative sequences produced by DADA2. A taxonomy classifier trained on V3 and V4 regions of reference 16S sequence24 (SILVA release 128) was then used to assign taxonomic identities to the representative sequences. The final site-by-species counts table based on exact sequence variants (ESVs)25 was exported from QIIME2, chloroplast and mitochondrial counts removed, and used as input into R for statistical analysis.\n\nFungi-enriched fecal DNA extraction\nFecal DNA was extracted by using Maxwell\u00ae RSC PureFood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega) with some modifications to increase the yield of fungi DNA. Approximately 100\u2009mg from each stool sample was prewashed with 1\u2009ml ddH2O and pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 1\u2009min. The pellet was resuspended in 800\u2009\u03bcl TE buffer (pH 7.5), supplemented with 1.6\u2009\u03bcl 2-mercaptoethanol and 500 U lyticase (Sigma) digesting cell walls of fungi, and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009min, which increase the lysis efficacy of fungal cell. The sample was then centrifuged at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 2\u2009min and the supernatant was discarded. After this pretreatment, DNA was subsequently extracted from the pellet using a Maxwell\u00ae RSC PureFood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 1\u2009ml of CTAB buffer was added to the pellet and vortexed for 30\u2009s, then the solution heated at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. After that, samples were vortexed thoroughly with beads (Biospec, 0.5\u2009mm for fungi and 0.1\u2009mm for bacteria,1:1) at maximum speed for 15\u2009min. Following this, 40\u2009\u00b5l proteinase K and 20\u2009\u00b5l RNase A were added and the mixture Incubated at 70\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The supernatant was then obtained by centrifuging at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009min and placed in a Maxwell\u00ae RSC instrument for DNA extraction. The extracted fecal DNA was used to preform metagenomics sequencing.\n\nVirus-like particles enrichment\nVirus-like particles (VLPs) were enriched and other DNA was eliminated according to a protocol described in a previous study13. A 400\u2009\u03bcl volume of saline-magnesium buffer (0.1\u2009M NaCl, 0.002% gelatin, 0.008\u2009M MgSO4H2O, 0.05\u2009M Tris pH7.5) was added to 200\u2009mg of stool sample and vortexed for 10\u2009min. The sample was then centrifuged at 2,000 x g and the pellet was discarded. To remove bacterial cells and other residual material, the suspension was filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm and two 0.22 \u03bcm filters. The cleared suspension was incubated separately with lysozyme (1\u2009mg/ml at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min) and chloroform (0.2x volume at RT for 10\u2009min) to degrade any remaining bacterial and host cell membranes. A DNase cocktail including 1U Baseline zero DNase (Epicenter) and 10U TurboDNaseI (Ambion) was added into the sample and the mixture was incubated at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min to eliminate DNA non protected within virus particles. VLPs were lysed (4% SDS plus 38\u2009mg/ml Proteinase K at 56\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min), treated with CTAB (2.5% CTAB plus 0.5\u2009M NaCl at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min), and nucleic acids were extracted with phenol: chloroform pH 8.0 (Invitrogen). The aqueous fraction was washed once with an equal volume of chloroform, purified and concentrated on a column (DNA Clean & Concentrator TM 89-5, Zymo Research). VLP DNA was amplified for 2\u2009h using the Phi29 polymerase (GenomiPhi V2 kit, GE Healthcare) prior to sequencing. Four independent amplification reactions were performed for each sample and pooled together to reduce amplification bias.\n\nMetagenomics sequencing and analysis\nFungi-enriched DNA and VLP-enriched DNA were sheared into fragments of 150\u2009bp VLP by ultrasonication (Covaris), and used to construct sequencing libraries. Libraries were prepared through the processes of end repairing, A-tailing, adapter ligation, size-select library and PCR amplification. DNA libraries from fungi-enriched DNA were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) to generate 150\u2009bp paired-end reads, yielding an average 67\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1 million reads (12\u2009G data) per sample (Supplementary Table\u00a02). VLP-enriched DNA libraries were sequenced (also 150\u2009bp paired-end) by on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at Novogene, Beijing, China. An average of 26\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 million reads (6\u2009G data) per sample were obtained (Supplementary Table\u00a03).\n\nRaw sequence reads were filtered and quality-trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.3626 as follows: 1. Trimming low quality base (quality score < 20), 2. Removing reads shorter than 50\u2009bp, 3. Tracing and cutting off sequencing adapters. Contaminating human reads were filtering using Kneaddata v0.7.3 (https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/kneaddata/wiki/Home, Reference database: GRCh38 p12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.38/) with default parameters.\n\nProfiling of bacterial taxonomy and functional composition was extracted using humann2 v0.11.127 from metagenomes of fungi-enriched DNA, which included taxonomic identification via MetaPhlAn2 by mapping reads to clade-specific markers28, annotation of species pangenomes through Bowtie2 v2.3.529 with reference to the ChocoPhlAn database (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann2_data/chocophlan/chocophlan.tar.gz), translated search of unmapped reads with DIAMOND v2.0.430 against the UniRef90 universal protein reference database (https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref)31, and pathway collection from the generated gene list with reference to the Metacyc database (https://metacyc.org/)32. Gene families and pathway abundances estimated from the data were normalized according to relative abundances of their corresponding microbial taxa reported by MetaPhlAn2 v2.96.1-0.\n\nTaxonomic profiling of fungi was performed on metagenomes sequenced from fungi-enriched DNA, using HumanMycobiomeScan33. The database was based on the complete fungal genomes available at the NCBI website (downloaded in January 2019). A second database containing 38,000 entries, corresponding to 265 different fungal genomes, was available for download (referred to as Fungi_FULL) on the project web page (https://sourceforge.net/projects/hmscan/). Briefly, metagenomic reads were aligned to the fungal genome database using via Bowtie 2 v2.3.534 to identify candidate fungal reads. Afterwards, sequences were trimmed for low quality scores (less than 3) and reads shorter than 60 bases are discarded. To remove human and bacterial contaminations, a double filtering step was performed using BMTagger v3.101-1 against the hg19 database for human sequences (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.13/) and a custom bacterial database which used for ViromeScan35. Then, the filtered reads were matched again to the fungal database using Bowtie 234 for definitive taxonomic assignment. The taxonomic affiliation was deduced by matching the result of the taxonomic assignment with an annotated list of fungal species, containing the entire phylogenetic classification for each genome included in the database. At the end of the process, the results were normalized by the length of the references included in the database, and the relative abundance profiles were obtained.\n\nTaxonomic profiling of virus was performed on metagenomes sequenced from VLP-enriched DNA, using Kraken 2 v2.0.7-beta. The complete NCBI viral RefSeq databases (accessed on October 20, 2018)36 were downloaded (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/). Kraken 2 examined the k-mers within a query sequence and used the information within those k-mers to query a database. sequence reads were mapped to the lowest common ancestor of all reference genomes with exact k-mer matches. Each query was thereafter classified to a taxon with the highest total hits of k-mers matched by pruning the general taxonomic trees affiliated with mapped genomes.\n\nQuantitative PCR for detection of Parastagonospora nodorum, Thielavia terrestris, Candida dubliniensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in fungi-enriched fecal DNA\nRelative quantification was achieved using the standard curve technique.\n\nParastagonospora nodorum, Thielavia terrestris, Candida dubliniensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were quantified by SYBR Green I assays using the SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex Taq \u2122, and total fungi was quantified by TaqMan assays using Taqman Premix Ex Taq \u2122 (TaKaRa). Standard curves were established by qPCR of serial dilutions of pUC57 plasmids harboring target genes (Supplementary Table\u00a04). The sequences of the primers and genes which were used to generate standard curve in this study are detailed in Supplementary Table\u00a04. The mass of four target species and total fungi were obtained through interpolation from the standard curve using CT value. Then the mass of three target species in each sample can be normalized by their respective fungal mass to calculate a normalized target value (Normalized target = Mass of each fungal species/Mass of total fungi). The normalized target values in the fecal samples from patient after FMT or donor are divided by normalized target values in patient\u2019s baseline sample to calculate the fold change (Fold change = Normalized target of post-FMT samples or donors\u2019 sample / Normalized target pre-FMT samples).\n\nQuantitative PCR for detection of Torque teno virus load in human fecal Virus-like particles DNA\nTotal Torque teno virus (TTVs) loads in patient and donor were quantified by TaqMan qPCR analysis (Premix Ex TaqTM, TaKaRa) using primers22: forward primer 5\u2032-GTGCCGIAGGTGAGTTTA-3\u2032; reverse primer 5\u2032-AGCCCGGCCAGTCC-3\u2032; probe 5\u2032-TCAAGGGGCAATTCGGGCT-3\u2032. The absolute copy numbers of TTVs were determined from standard curves established by qPCR of serial dilutions of pUC57 plasmids harboring target genes.\n\nPCR detection of diphtheria toxin gene in fungi-enriched DNA\nThe PCR assay was performed by using Primers, Tox1(ATCCACTTTTAGTGCGAGAACCTTCGTCA) and Tox2 (GAAAACTTTTCTTCGTACCACGGGACTAA) (248\u2009bp)37, following a condition (30 cycled at 98\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, 58\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u2009\u00b0C 10\u2009s). DNA extracted from C. diphtheriae ATCC 13812 and C. diphtheriae ATCC 19409 which can produce diphtheria toxin was used as positive controls.\n\nStatistics\nCounts data from bacteria, viruses and fungi were imported into R (v3.5.1). Alpha diversity metrics (richness and diversity) and rarefaction were calculated using the phyloseq package (v1.26.0). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities of the microbial community structure were performed using the vegan package (v2.5-3). Heat maps were generated using the pheatmap package (v1.0.10) and was based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between different pathways in terms of their abundances across all samples. The proportion of taxa derived from donors in total taxa of patient\u2019s stool samples was calculated by fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST)38.\n\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary Information\n\n Peer Review File\n\n Reporting Summary\n\n Peer review information: Nature Communications thanks Marcel van den Brink and the other, anonymous reviewer(s) for their contribution to the peer review of this work.

Early-stage MF follows a slow, indolent course [1], with symptoms present for extended periods of time. Due to the clinical similarity between benign skin diseases (such as eczema and psoriasis) and early-stage MF, as well as the lack of a singular diagnostic test or specific tumor markers, median time between MF symptom onset and biopsy-confirmed diagnosis is 4\u20136\u00a0years [2]. Most patients with early-stage MF have an average life expectancy following treatment but reduced quality of life [3]. Median survival for those with stage III or IV disease is low (<\u20095\u00a0years), and\u2009\u2265\u200950% die of their disease [4\u20137]. MF treatment goals are symptom control and quality of life improvement [8], as there are no curative therapeutic options aside from allogeneic stem cell transplantation [9].\n\nIn this review, we will briefly present the treatment guidelines for the management of patients with MF, discuss the role of topical chlormethine gel as part of the treatment paradigm, provide an overview of the clinical data demonstrating the effectiveness of the gel, and present real-world experience of chlormethine gel usage from four different dermatology practices.\n\nThis review is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. Informed consent was provided by the patient whose case was included.\n\nClinical Management Guidelines for MF\n\nMF treatment guidelines (European Society for Medical Oncology [10], European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [11], National Comprehensive Cancer Network [12], and British Association of Dermatologists/UK Cutaneous Lymphoma Group [13]) base their recommendations on disease stage [10\u201313].\n\nFor asymptomatic patients with early-stage MF (stage IA), \u201cwatch and wait\u201d is considered an appropriate option. For symptomatic patients, those with adverse prognostic factors (such as plaque stage disease or large cell transformation), or those with extensive disease involvement (stage IB), skin-directed therapies (SDTs) should be initiated. The most commonly used SDTs for treating early-stage MF are topical corticosteroids [8, 14], topical chlormethine or retinoids [15, 16], and phototherapy; superficial radiotherapy may also be employed. Patients with advanced-stage disease generally receive systemic single-agent or combination therapy with SDTs. Addition of an effective SDT can alleviate symptoms and shorten time to response compared with systemic therapy alone [11].\n\nChlormethine as Topical Chemotherapy for Managing MF\n\nAll major guidelines recommend the use of chlormethine for first-line treatment in adult patients with MF [10\u201313]. Chlormethine is a bifunctional alkylating agent that inhibits rapidly proliferating cells by binding and crosslinking DNA strands. The original aqueous and ointment formulations were not approved as a therapy for MF, and it was subsequently developed as a topical gel [15, 17]. This formulation was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 for treating stage IA and IB MF in patients who received prior SDT, has been registered in Israel since 2016 (for the same indication as in the USA), was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2017 for treatment of adult patients with MF [18], and is now available commercially in a number of European countries. Chlormethine gel has been available in France since 2014 under a \u201ctemporary authorization for use\u201d program that ended in July 2019, with 876 patients having participated [19].\n\nThe chlormethine gel (chlormethine 0.016% w/w, equivalent to 0.02% chlormethine hydrochloride) formulation was designed to maximize efficacy and tolerability. Its nonaqueous nature imparts high stability, and the active solvent, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (Transcutol\u00ae), promotes delivery of the drug to the epidermis [20\u201322], although there is no evidence of systemic absorption of chlormethine following application [15]. Efficacy is enhanced by inclusion of the excipient, Klucel\u2122 hydroxypropylcellulose (Ashland) [23], which results in a fast-drying, nongreasy formulation with a viscosity that is more likely to remain at the administration site, which makes it easier to apply at home. The intrinsic antimicrobial nature of the active ingredients [24] removes the need for antimicrobial preservatives (which frequently cause skin reactions), thus potentially reducing the risk of allergy, although further investigations are required to confirm this.\n\nChlormethine may be used as monotherapy in early-stage MF, in combination with systemic therapy in advanced-stage disease [25\u201327], and as maintenance treatment [11, 28]. The chlormethine gel label indicates daily application; however, the frequency of application may be reduced according to the patient\u2019s needs. For severe skin reactions, treatment should be suspended (in some cases permanently) and upon improvement can be restarted gradually up to daily frequency, if tolerated.\n\nChlormethine in MF Management: A Review of the Literature\n\nThere is a substantial body of prospective and retrospective evidence underlying the recommendation of chlormethine as a treatment option for patients with MF in all stages of the disease (summarized in Table 1 [15, 17, 26, 27, 29\u201344]). These studies have demonstrated that chlormethine is efficacious, with a durable response that may be sustained for up to 8\u00a0years in some cases.Table 1 Summary of efficacy and safety findings of studies of topical chlormethine in the treatment of MF\n\nFirst author (year)\tStudy description\tPatients, n\tTreatment(s) administered\tEfficacy findings\tSafety findings\t\nPrice et al.

Response rates for chlormethine gel were consistently higher than those for the ointment for the primary endpoint of Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS), and once-daily (QD) treatment with chlormethine gel met all prespecified criteria for noninferiority. In the efficacy-evaluable population, overall response rates (ORRs) were 77% and 59% for the gel and ointment, respectively [15]. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval of the CAILS score in the efficacy-evaluable population not only exceeded the noninferiority threshold (\u2265\u20090.75), but also lies entirely above 1. On the basis of a post hoc approach of switching from noninferiority to superiority testing, these results are consistent with superiority (p\u2009<\u20090.05) findings for chlormethine gel.\n\nThe gel formulation had a faster time to response (50% response in 26\u00a0weeks) than the ointment (42\u00a0weeks). Response rates at 52\u00a0weeks were 76% for the gel and 56% for the ointment. Maximum response to chlormethine gel treatment occurred between 8 and 10\u00a0months, emphasizing the importance of continued treatment and close follow-up of patients to maximize the response potential [15]. A follow-up 7-month extension study evaluated a higher dose of chlormethine gel (0.04%) in patients who did not have a complete response (CR) after previously receiving chlormethine gel or ointment for 12\u00a0months. In total, 27% of patients had a confirmed response, which could occur as late as 16\u00a0months after initiation of the lower-dose chlormethine treatment [17], thereby reinforcing the value of continued chlormethine treatment.\n\nIn the 201 study,\u2009>\u200950% of patients in each group experienced a skin-related adverse event (AE). Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) was most common, although this was managed with treatment adjustments, such as suspension or reduction of chlormethine treatment and the use of emollients/oral antihistamines. No treatment-related serious AEs were reported, and there was no evidence of systemic absorption of chlormethine [15, 17].\n\nThe prospective, observational, noninterventional US-based PROVe trial was designed to provide information on the use of chlormethine gel in a real-world practice setting (NCT02296164). Patients who were diagnosed with any stage of MF and were being treated with chlormethine gel in combination with other MF therapies were enrolled. At 12\u00a0months, the proportion of stage IA and IB responders (defined as\u2009\u2265\u200950% reduction from baseline in body surface area [BSA] involvement) was 44% in patients who received chlormethine plus topical corticosteroids plus other treatment and 45% in patients who received chlormethine plus other treatment. A peak response occurred at 18\u00a0months for patients with stage IA and IB disease in the chlormethine plus other treatment group (67%). Overall, 28% of patients experienced a treatment-related AE; the most common skin-related AEs deemed to be therapy related were dermatitis (12%), pruritus (7%), skin irritation (7%), and erythema (4%) [45].\n\nOther studies using compounded formulations of chlormethine (ointment or solution) have reported response rates of 58\u201369% in patients with early-stage disease [26, 30, 36\u201338] and 13\u201353% in patients with advanced disease [26, 30, 37]. Moreover, one trial has reported a 10-year overall survival rate of 71% in patients with mainly T1 or T2 disease (96%). For those patients who attained a CR with topical chlormethine, a 5-year relapse-free survival rate of 42% was observed [37]. Another study found that the probability of achieving clinically apparent remission rates at 2\u00a0years was 76% for stage I MF, 45% for stage II, and 49% for stage III disease [35].\n\nReal-world Experience of Chlormethine Gel in the Management of Patients with MF (Table 2)\n\nTable 2 Summary of the real-world experience from four centers\n\nCharacteristic\tPenn Dermatology Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma Clinic, USA\tCutaneous Oncology Clinic, Columbia University, USA\tRabin Medical Center, Israel\tH\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, France\t\nNumber of patients with MF seen/year\t\u2009~\u2009200\t\u2009>\u2009350\t300\t\u2009~\u2009320\t\nDisease stage of patients with MF\tMostly early stage\tRanging from stage IA or IB to S\u00e9zary syndrome\tEarly stage\tEarly and advanced stages\t\nChlormethine gel usage\tEarly stage: treatment after corticosteroids failure\n\nAdvanced stage: adjunctive treatment to systemic therapies or other SDTs\n\n\tFor patients with early stage, skin-limited disease\n\nAdvanced disease: in combination with systemic therapies\n\n\tSecond-line treatment in patients for whom at least 1 previous SDT failed (topical steroids or phototherapy)\tEarly stage: second-line treatment after failure of high-potency corticosteroids, mainly when phototherapy is not possible or contraindicated\n\nLate stage: in combination with systemic treatments when insufficient effect is observed on patch/plaques lesions\n\n\t\nChlormethine gel initial application frequency\tAlternative evenings or 2 nights/week\t1\u20132 times/week, alternating with topical steroids\tGradually, up to a maximum of QD, sometimes with 1\u20132 times/week topical steroids\t3 times/week alternating with topical steroids.

This center uses chlormethine gel as a first-line SDT in patients with early-stage disease for whom topical corticosteroids have failed. It is applied as a localized spot treatment or, for patients with more-extensive BSA involvement, as full-body treatment (from the neck down). In advanced-stage disease, chlormethine gel is used as an adjunctive SDT to systemic therapy and other SDTs. For at-home administration, patients must take appropriate precautions to avoid inadvertent mucosal exposure to chlormethine gel in other household members/pets.\n\nPatients are instructed to apply chlormethine gel thinly, initially only every other night or 2 nights/week, then slowly increase the application frequency as tolerance permits, to minimize irritant dermatitis. Patients may apply topical steroids every other day to the same area, but this treatment is eventually tapered if no AEs result from chlormethine gel treatment. Patients using full-body treatment are advised that they may notice new lesions during the first month; however, these are subclinical MF lesions unmasked by chlormethine gel, not necessarily a sign of true disease progression.\n\nIn our experience, a response to chlormethine gel treatment can be expected within 4\u20136\u00a0weeks. It takes 4\u201324\u00a0months to achieve a CR; the ORR is 70%, with 10% of these achieving a CR and 90% achieving a partial response (PR). ICD or allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is observed in 20\u201325% of patients and occurs mostly within the first 6\u00a0months of therapy. When dermatitis or other skin AEs occur, we temporarily discontinue chlormethine gel treatment and apply potent topical steroids to the affected area twice daily (BID) for 2\u20133\u00a0weeks. A \u201cpatch test,\u201d where chlormethine gel is applied daily to a small unaffected skin area, is then performed. If dermatitis reappears, this is suggestive of ACD, and chlormethine gel is discontinued permanently. If no dermatitis appears, the prior reactions are most likely ICD, and chlormethine gel may be reintroduced slowly with applications every other night or 2 nights/week. This practice of \u201cstarting low and going slow\u201d with application frequency is analogous to how we use other SDTs with known irritant effects (e.g., topical retinoids). Patients who experience a moderate-to-severe dermatitis reaction to chlormethine gel may have complete clearance of the original MF lesion once the dermatitis is cleared with potent topical steroids, as has been observed in the literature [46].\n\nThe Cutaneous Oncology Clinic at Columbia University\n\nAt the Comprehensive Cutaneous Oncology Clinic at Columbia University (USA), a range of disease stages are seen, from early-stage IA and IB MF-CTCL to stage IV disease, including S\u00e9zary syndrome. The patients are managed according to published algorithms in a stage-based approach. For patients with early-stage skin-limited disease, topical steroids, narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB), and chlormethine gel are the first-line treatments. Based on their schedule, personal preferences, or medical history, and in consultation with their physician, patients choose a therapy that best fits their lifestyle and disease state. Light therapy is an effective way to treat cutaneous manifestations of MF, but it may necessitate frequent visits to the physician's office and may not be convenient for people with busy work and family schedules. Some of the benefits of chlormethine gel include the ability to apply the gel at home, reducing the need for office visits for light therapy in those patients unable to incorporate visits into their daily schedule. Chlormethine gel treatment can continue away from home, provided refrigeration is available, so travel need not interfere with the treatment schedule. Additionally, chlormethine gel is recommended over NBUVB for patients with high risk of melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancers, including patients with significant personal history of these diseases as well as light skin, numerous atypical nevi, or immunosuppression [47]. Given that a link between chlormethine gel use and development of nonmelanoma skin cancers has been suggested, concurrent NBUVB and chlormethine gel treatment is not typically advised in our patient population [48].\n\nWhile chlormethine gel is FDA approved for treating stage IA and IB MF in patients who received one prior treatment, we also use chlormethine gel therapy in combination with systemic therapies in more advanced disease, including S\u00e9zary syndrome.\n\nAt Columbia University, over 350 patients per year are treated with chlormethine gel, all with relatively low toxicity. The main AE is irritant dermatitis, seen in\u2009~\u200930% of treated patients. ACD may be observed, and chlormethine gel should be discontinued in these cases. However, ICD is generally well controlled with mid- to high-potency topical steroid use, and chlormethine gel treatment can be continued in most patients. Approximately 10% of patients develop severe ICD, with lymphomatoid papulosis observed in a few patients; this resolves upon discontinuation of chlormethine gel [49].\n\nPatients generally start chlormethine gel with less frequent applications (one or two times/week, alternating with topical steroids). If the patient can tolerate the gel without ICD or other concerns, the frequency is increased to daily use. In some patients, the gel may be used BID depending on symptoms. In our experience, response rates of up to 80% have been seen in patients with early-stage disease. Initial response is typically observed 1\u20132\u00a0months after starting treatment, and therapy is continued for 12\u00a0months in responders. Frequency can subsequently be reduced during the \u201cmaintenance phase,\u201d which may last from several months to several years, or chlormethine gel can be discontinued when cutaneous lesions disappear completely. A significant proportion of patients use skin-directed (mostly topical steroids) or systemic agents in combination with chlormethine gel.\n\nThe Cutaneous Lymphoma Clinic at Rabin Medical Center\n\nIn Israel, in daily practice the first-line treatment for early-stage MF (after topical steroids) is usually phototherapy, while chlormethine gel is used as a second-line treatment in patients for whom phototherapy has failed or who have developed intolerability. Chlormethine gel as a first-line therapy (after topical steroids) is reserved for patients with early-stage MF who have contraindications to phototherapy (e.g., history of melanoma or multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers) or those who foresee adherence problems to phototherapy. Regional or whole-body application depends on the distribution of lesions and extent of cutaneous involvement. Since chlormethine gel has the potential to cause irritation, treatment initiation involves gradually increasing the application frequency up to the maximal tolerable frequency, but no more than QD, to minimize the occurrence and degree of irritation. The process is similar to that adopted with other topical treatments with irritant potential (e.g., retinoids) [50]. The skin folds and face are generally more susceptible to irritant reactions; hence, the maximal recommended application frequency is usually alternate days.\n\nICD is the most common AE and is usually mild. In the case of mild irritation, patients may benefit from temporary addition of topical steroids without a change in chlormethine gel application frequency, although in some patients, emollients are sufficient to alleviate symptoms. If irritation is moderate to severe, topical steroid application is advocated alongside temporary reduction (moderate irritation) or temporary discontinuation (severe irritation) of chlormethine gel application. Once irritation is under control or resolved, the application frequency is gradually increased or chlormethine gel is reintroduced at the highest tolerable frequency. In many patients, topical steroids may be withdrawn or minimized to once-weekly application. In the case of severe irritation, reintroduction of chlormethine gel may be attempted but is initially limited to a small area to assess tolerability.\n\nThe main differential diagnosis of ICD is ACD. Patch tests are not done routinely, and the diagnosis is based solely on clinical judgment. Key diagnostic features are: (1) timing of appearance, with delayed-type hypersensitivity occurring at least 2\u20134\u00a0weeks following treatment initiation versus primary irritation, which may develop as early as a few days after application; (2) distribution, where extension of dermatitis beyond treated areas indicates delayed-type hypersensitivity versus primary irritation, which is localized to treated areas only. ACD is suspected in few patients. If the allergic reaction is mild to moderate, the protocol is the same as for severe irritation. For patients with severe ACD, permanent discontinuation is required. It is important that any type of dermatitis is distinguished clearly from the unmasking effect of chlormethine gel, where new lesions are observed in the treated areas; this is seen in a small fraction of patients and usually occurs during the first month of treatment. Patients should be encouraged to continue with treatment, and whole-body application should be considered.\n\nH\u00f4pital Saint-Louis\n\nH\u00f4pital Saint-Louis (France) sees\u2009~\u2009320 patients per year with cutaneous lymphomas of any MF stage;\u2009~\u200980% have early-stage and 20% have advanced-stage disease. In patients with early-stage IA MF, chlormethine gel is prescribed after failure of high-potency corticosteroids, whereas for patients with stage IB, chlormethine gel may be prescribed as a first-line therapy, particularly in patients for whom phototherapy is not possible or contraindicated. In patients with late-stage disease, chlormethine gel is used in combination with systemic treatments when insufficient effect is observed on patch or plaque lesions. Response to chlormethine gel may occur 9\u00a0months after treatment initiation, but in some patients a period of 12 or 15\u00a0months may be required to achieve remission. In our experience, 19% of patients achieve a CR, and 66% have a PR.\n\nThe most common AE is skin reactions, mostly contact irritation versus real allergic dermatitis. When severe skin reactions are observed (e.g., moderately severe to severe dermatitis), chlormethine gel is discontinued and topical steroids are prescribed. Once the reactions have disappeared, chlormethine gel may be applied to a limited zone with persisting lesions on the trunk or the limb, with a reduced schedule (one or two times/week). If the patient presents with real sensitization, contact allergy will develop on the limited area, thereby indicating the patient has a true allergy, and chlormethine gel is contraindicated. In most patients, however, this limited application is well tolerated, and it is possible to apply chlormethine gel to the whole skin, up to three times/week, and often every day. Real patch testing to determine whether the response is ICD or ACD may be very informative in such situations.\n\nA 58-year-old male with a history of melanoma on his back presented with stage IB MF. The patient had disseminated pruriginous erythematosquamous patches and plaques, although there were no adenopathies or blood involvement. A cutaneous biopsy demonstrated a band-like infiltrate with epidermotropism and atypical lymphocytes, and the patient was diagnosed with stage IB MF. Treatment with topical clobetasol yielded no response, while treatment with phototherapy was not possible due to the history of melanoma. Consequently, this patient was treated with chlormethine gel QD. Due to the dissemination of lesions, chlormethine gel was applied to the whole body, except for the face and scalp, where no lesions were present. After 9\u00a0months of chlormethine gel treatment, the patient was in full remission and treatment was stopped (Fig.\u00a01).Fig. 1 Patient case images. a Epidermotropism and atypical lymphocytes, diagnostic of mycosis fungoides. b Skin lesions on the patient\u2019s legs before and after 3 and 6\u00a0months of once-daily chlormethine gel application\n\nConclusions\n\nChlormethine gel is a therapeutic option for patients with MF skin lesions, and a range of retrospective, prospective, and observational clinical data supports its use in all disease stages. Its validity as a treatment is supported by international guidelines, which all recommend chlormethine gel as a first-line treatment for patients with early-stage MF. In later stages of MF, systemic treatments are usually indicated and prescribed, although patch and plaque lesions in these patients may be only partially responsive to systemic treatments; the addition of topical treatments, such as chlormethine gel, may be very useful in such cases. Moreover, chlormethine gel may be important as an adjunctive therapy in patients with late-stage disease (especially for persisting patches and plaques) to palliate symptoms and to improve the overall response and as a maintenance treatment since systemic therapies do not typically result in durable CRs.\n\nIndeed, experience from clinical practice in the USA, Israel, and France has shown that chlormethine gel is used both as an SDT (often in the first line) in early-stage MF and as an adjunctive therapy in advanced-stage disease. The strategies employed by the centers demonstrate that emergent cutaneous reactions can be managed if the appropriate protocols are followed. Time to response varies slightly between centers, perhaps reflecting the diversity of patients who were seen (Table 2). ICD is the most frequently observed form of dermatitis, and all centers use topical steroids to manage this AE, although discontinuing chlormethine treatment may be required for severe reactions.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to gain a more in-depth understanding of the utility of chlormethine gel in patients with MF and the nature of the emergent skin reactions. The PROVe trial found that chlormethine gel is an effective treatment across all disease stages [45]. No chlormethine gel-related serious AEs occurred in the study, and the reported emergent skin-related AEs were manageable and less prevalent than in the pivotal clinical trial [15], possibly because of frequent dose adjustments and the co-administration of corticosteroids, which reflect the real-world experience reported herein.\n\nThe Mechlorethamine Induced Contact Dermatitis Avoidance Study (MIDAS; NCT03380026), which evaluated the incidence and severity of contact dermatitis following treatment with chlormethine gel alone or in combination with triamcinolone ointment in patients with MF, aimed to gain a greater understanding of chlormethine-related contact dermatitis. The study found that contact dermatitis with and without hypersensitivity responses was seen, and histopathology revealed a superficial and deep lymphocytic infiltrate with spongiosis and eosinophils similar to arthropod assault [43, 44]. Evaluation of the patient samples is ongoing to provide more information about the nature of the skin reactions, which should further help to guide management of patients who develop contact dermatitis. Additional information that may be used to guide treatment and manage contact dermatitis in patients who receive chlormethine gel may come from the REACH trial (Study to Determine the Aetiology of Chlormethine Gel Induced-skin Drug Reaction in Early-stage Mycosis Fungoides Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma; NCT04218825), which is currently recruiting.\n\nIn conclusion, chlormethine gel is an effective treatment for patients with all stages of MF. While contact dermatitis is an emergent skin-related AE, it can be managed effectively in most cases if the appropriate strategies are in place.\n\nFunding\n\nFunding for this review the journal\u2019s and Rapid Service Fee were funded by Helsinn Healthcare SA, Lugano, Switzerland.\n\nMedical Writing and/or Editorial Assistance\n\nEditorial and medical writing assistance was provided by Joanne Franklin, PhD, CMPP, from Aptitude Health, The Hague, The Netherlands, funded by Helsinn Healthcare SA, Lugano, Switzerland.\n\nAuthorship\n\nAll named authors meet the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship for this article, take responsibility for the integrity of the work as a whole, and have given their approval for this version to be published.\n\nAuthorship Contributions\n\nAll authors equally contributed to the concept, design, and drafting of the manuscript.\n\nDisclosures\n\nLarisa J.

The Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), which is an inflammation-based index composed of serum levels of C-reactive protein and albumin, predicts prognosis in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) without ILD. In this study, we investigated AE-ILD and survival outcome based on the GPS in patients with ILD associated with SCLC who were receiving chemotherapy.\n\n\n\nMedical records of patients who received platinum-based first-line chemotherapy between June 2010 and May 2019 were retrospectively reviewed to compare the incidence of AE-ILD and overall survival (OS) between GPS 0, 1, and 2.\n\n\n\nAmong our cohort of 31 patients, six (19.3%) experienced chemotherapy-triggered AE-ILD. The AE-ILD incidence increased from 9.5% to 25.0% and 50.0% with increase in GPS of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed remarkable associations between GPS 2 and both AE-ILD (odds ratio for GPS 2, 18.69; p\u00a0=\u00a00.046) and prognosis (hazard ratio of GPS 2, 13.52; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Furthermore, median OS in the GPS 0, 1, and 2 groups was 16.2, 9.8, and 7.1\u00a0months, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\n\n\n\nOur results suggest that GPS 2 is both a predictor of risk of chemotherapy-triggered AE-ILD and a prognostic indicator in patients with ILD associated with SCLC. We propose that GPS may be used as a guide to distinguish chemotherapy-tolerant patients from those at high risk of AE-ILD.\n\nTEXT:\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPatients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) are 7\u201314 times more prone to lung cancer compared with those without ILD 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ; in fact, 4%\u201338% of patients with ILD concomitantly have lung cancer. 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 Therefore, lung cancer is considered the most common complication of ILD. Conversely, ILD is reported in 10%\u201330% of patients with lung cancer, 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 seriously affecting prognosis. 12 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 This is because of the limited availability of effective chemotherapy approaches and exacerbation of treatment\u2010related ILD. 5 , 18 Studies exclusively conducted in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have reported incidence rates of chemotherapy\u2010triggered acute exacerbation (AE)\u2010ILD ranging from 11.9% to 36.4%. 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 These results indicate that lung cancer and ILD occur concomitantly with each other, and it is important to evaluate not only lung cancer but also ILD itself during chemotherapy. However, in most clinical trials, the presence of concomitant ILD is an exclusion criterion for patient enrollment because fatal exacerbation of ILD is problematic. Exacerbation of ILD affects prognosis of lung cancer associated with ILD 5 , 18 , 26 , 27 ; therefore, the identification of predictors of ILD exacerbation and prognosis is an important task.\n\nGlasgow prognostic score (GPS) is a score based on systemic inflammation that combines serum albumin (Alb) and serum C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) levels. GPS was first proposed for non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by Forrest et al. in 2003 and demonstrated to be a better prognostic factor compared with scoring based on either stage or performance status. 28 After its introduction, GPS was reported to be a reproducible predictor of long\u2010term prognosis for NSCLC and SCLC. 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 However, there have been no previous studies examining the relationship between GPS and SCLC with concomitant ILD in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether GPS predicts prognosis and chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD in patients with SCLC and concomitant ILD.\n\nMETHODS\n\nPatients\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Tokyo Medical University in Tokyo, Japan (approval number: T2020\u20100096). Retrospective data were anonymously analyzed, and patients were given the opportunity to either opt out of the study or provide consent for participation using a waiver of written informed consent granted from the institutional review board. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with ILD associated with SCLC who received cytotoxic chemotherapy between June 2010 and May 2019 at Tokyo Medical University Hospital. All patients were diagnosed with SCLC cytologically and/or histologically. Tumor, lymph nodes, and distant metastasis (TNM) stage was evaluated based on the eighth edition of TNM classification of lung cancer. 39 Moreover, patients with SCLC into \u201climited\u201d disease (LD) or \u201cextensive\u201d disease (ED) were grouped as per the Veterans Administration Lung Study Group staging system. 40 Physicians selected the chemotherapy regimen considering the therapeutic effect and risk of AE\u2010ILD; however, patients receiving irinotecan were ineligible because it is a contraindicated chemotherapeutic drug in Japan for patients with SCLC and ILD. Patients who did not receive chemotherapy, transferred to a different hospital before undergoing chemotherapy, or had an infectious condition at first\u2010line chemotherapy administration, were excluded in this study. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the number of months from first\u2010line chemotherapy administration until death or censored. We then defined patients as censored if patients were alive on May 31, 2019. Laboratory measurements, including serum CRP and Alb used for GPS, were performed up to one\u00a0week before first\u2010line chemotherapy administration. We excluded those patients with SCLC lacking CRP or Alb data. Patients were categorized in the following three GPS\u2010determined groups: patients with a CRP \u2264\u200910\u00a0mg/l and Alb \u2265\u200935\u2009g/l were Group 0; patients with a CRP >\u200910\u00a0mg/l or Alb <\u200935\u2009g/l were Group 1; and patients with a CRP >\u200910\u00a0mg/l and Alb <\u200935\u2009g/l were Group 2. 28 , 41 Moreover, we measured serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Krebs von den Lungen\u20106 (KL\u20106) as markers of tissue damage and ILD, respectively.\n\nClassification of ILD and diagnosis of AE\u2010ILD\n\nILD was evaluated based on high\u2010resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, which was performed at least 30\u2009days before chemotherapy was first administered. ILD was independently diagnosed by two experienced pulmonologists (R.K. and T.T.) using the criteria of ground\u2010glass attenuation, reticular shadow, or honeycomb lung in both lung fields, without prior knowledge of patient clinical outcome. Based on recent guidelines for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we then grouped patients with ILD having an usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern or non\u2010UIP pattern. 42 UIP pattern was then characterized as subpleural and basal dominant reticulation with honeycombing with/without peripheral traction bronchiectasis. The diagnostic criteria for non\u2010UIP pattern included existence of probable UIP pattern, indeterminate for UIP pattern, or pattern with alternative diagnosis. Chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD was defined as the worsening of dyspnea and newly developed bilateral ground\u2010glass opacification and/or consolidation within four\u00a0weeks of the last administration of chemotherapy, not completely explained by infectious disease, cardiac failure, fluid overload, or pulmonary embolism. 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 We excluded collagen vascular disease\u2010associated ILD and occupational lung disease because these diseases may cause high levels of CRP and/or low levels of Alb, thereby affecting GPS determination. Our cohort did not include patients who had either received an immunosuppressive drug before chemotherapy or underwent chest radiotherapy and received immunotherapy.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nData from medical records of patients were described either as values (percentages) or as median (range). Among baseline patient characteristics, we analyzed all categorical variables using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test or chi\u2010square test as appropriate. Both univariate and multivariate analyses of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD incidence rate were determined using binomial logistic regression analysis. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to estimate survival outcomes, and log\u2010rank test was then used to compare the survival of patients using GPS 0, 1, and 2. Both univariate and multivariate analyses with a Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to identify independent risk factors for survival. A p\u2010value <\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 26.0. (IBM Corp.).\n\nRESULTS\n\nPatient characteristics\n\nThe study flow is summarized in Figure\u00a0S1. During the study period, eight patients were excluded as follows: two patients diagnosed with secondary ILD (one with rheumatoid arthritis and one with dermatomyositis), serum Alb was not measured in one patient prior to first\u2010line chemotherapy administration, one patient did not receive chemotherapy, one patient was transferred from our hospital before undergoing first\u2010line chemotherapy, one patient had an infectious condition, and two patients received irinotecan. Consequently, our cohort comprised 31 patients with ILD associated with SCLC receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. The baseline characteristics of our patients are shown in Table\u00a0 1 . The median age of our cohort was 71\u2009years, 26 patients (83.9%) were male, 25 patients (80.6%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and 19 patients (61.3%) had TNM lung cancer stage IV. All patients had a smoking history; 15 patients (48.4%) were former smokers and the other 16 (51.6%) were current smokers. A total of 12 patients (38.7%) were classified as LD, whereas 19 patients (61.3%) were ED at the time of first\u2010line chemotherapy administration. The median serum LDH and KL\u20106 levels were 244\u2009U/l and 554\u2009U/ml, respectively. A total of 25 patients (80.6%) underwent a pulmonary function test before administration of chemotherapy; the median predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) was 93.1%. Based on HRCT results, UIP pattern and emphysema were identified in 14 (45.2%) and 26 (83.8%) patients, respectively.\n\nTABLE 1 Patient characteristics and clinical manifestation based on Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) at time of first\u2010line chemotherapy\n\n\tTotal\tGPS 0\tGPS 1\tGPS 2\tp\u2010value\t\nNumber of patients\t31\t21\t4\t6\t\t\nAge (years)\n\nMedian range\n\n\t71\t71\n\n68\u201378\n\n\t69\n\n60\u201377\n\n\t71\n\n61\u201375\n\n\t0.866\t\nGender (%)\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\n\t26 (83.9)\n\n5 (16.1)\n\n\t18 (85.7)\n\n3 (14.3)\n\n\t3 (75.0)\n\n1 (25.0)\n\n\t5 (83.3)\n\n1 (16.7)\n\n\t0.287\n\n\t\nECOG PS (%)\n\n0, 1\n\n2\u20134\n\n\t25 (80.6)\n\n6 (19.4)\n\n\t16 (76.2)\n\n5 (23.8)\n\n\t4 (100)\n\n0 (0.00)\n\n\t5 (83.3)\n\n1 (16.7)\n\n\t0.534\n\n\t\nSmoking history (%)\n\nFormer\n\nCurrent\n\n\t15 (48.4)\n\n16 (51.6)\n\n\t13 (61.9)\n\n8 (38.1)\n\n\t1 (25.0)\n\n3 (75.0)\n\n\t1 (16.7)\n\n5 (83.3)\n\n\t0.089\n\n\t\nPack\u2010years\n\nMedian range\n\n\t50.0\t60.0\n\n40.0\u201385.0\n\n\t45.0\n\n24.2\u201350.0\n\n\t41.5\n\n23.2\u201354.2\n\n\t0.054\t\nBMI (kg/m2)\n\nMedian range\n\n\t22.5\t22.4\n\n21.2\u201324.3\n\n\t24.3\n\n20.5\u201326.2\n\n\t22.7\n\n18.1\u201324.2\n\n\t0.610\t\nDisease stage (%)\n\nLimited\n\nExtensive\n\n\t12 (38.7)\n\n19 (61.3)\n\n\t10 (47.6)\n\n11 (52.4)\n\n\t1 (25.0)\n\n3 (75.0)\n\n\t1 (16.7)\n\n5 (83.3)\n\n\t0.325\n\n\t\nClinical stage (%)\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\n\t12 (38.7)\n\n19 (61.3)\n\n\t6 (19.4)\n\n25 (80.6)\n\n\t1 (25.0)\n\n3 (75.0)\n\n\t2 (33.3)\n\n4 (66.7)\n\n\t0.763\n\n\t\nLDH (U/l)\n\nMedian range\n\n\t244\t236\n\n209\u2013293\n\n\t299\n\n218\u2013829\n\n\t254\n\n200\u2013670\n\n\t0.521\t\nKL\u20106 (U/ml)\n\nMedian range\n\n\t554\t554\n\n369\u2013933\n\n\t860\n\n288\u20131330\n\n\t547\n\n303\u2013709\n\n\t0.701\t\n% predicted FVC\n\nMedian range\n\n\t93.1\t101.9\n\n(n\u00a0=\u200917)\n\n90.3\u2013116.2\n\n\t92.5\n\n(n\u00a0=\u20094)\n\n77.9\u2013100.1\n\n\t80.4\n\n(n\u00a0=\u20094)\n\n52.9\u201389.9\n\n\t0.027\t\nHRCT pattern (%)\n\nUIP pattern\n\nNon\u2010UIP pattern\n\n\t14 (45.2)\n\n17 (54.8)\n\n\t10 (47.6)\n\n11 (52.4)\n\n\t2 (50.0)\n\n2 (50.0)\n\n\t2 (33.3)\n\n4 (66.7)\n\n\t0.807\n\n\t\nEmphysema (%)\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n\t26 (83.8)\n\n5 (16.1)\n\n\t18 (85.7)\n\n3 (14.3)\n\n\t4 (100.0)\n\n0 (0.00)\n\n\t5 (83.3)\n\n1 (16.6)\n\n\t0.703\n\n\t\nSecond\u2010line chemotherapy (%)\t20 (64.5)\t13 (61.9)\t3 (75.0)\t4 (66.6)\t0.267\t\nThird\u2010line chemotherapy (%)\t5 (16.1)\t3 (14.2)\t0 (0.00)\t2 (33.3)\t\u2014\t\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; ECOG PS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status; FVC, forced vital capacity; HRCT, high\u2010resolution computed tomography; KL\u20106, Krebs von den Lungen\u20106; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; UIP, usual interstitial pneumonia.\n\nAssociation of GPS with clinicopathological parameters\n\nBased on GPS, 21 (67.7%), four (12.9%), and six (19.3%) patients were classified to the GPS 0, 1, and 2 groups, respectively. Patient characteristics in GPS subgroups are shown in Table\u00a01. We reported no significant differences among the three groups except for decreased predicted FVC with higher GPS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027).\n\nChemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD\n\nDuring the present study period, cumulative incidence of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD is shown in Table\u00a0S1. Of our 31 patients, six experienced chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD and none experienced more than two episodes of AE\u2010ILD. The evaluation of patients who experienced AE showed that two patients had a GPS of 0, one patient had a score of 1, and three patients had a GPS of 2. All patients developed grade \u22653 pneumonitis, and one patient died of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD. All patients experienced AE\u2010ILD within a year of receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Based on our evaluation, the annual incidence of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD in patients with GPS 0, 1, and 2 was 9.5%, 25.0%, and 50.0%, respectively (Figure\u00a01). Furthermore, our results indicate that GPS tended to be associated with incidence of AE\u2010ILD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.082). Next, we determined whether there was evidence of a relationship between incidence of AE\u2010ILD and individual variables (shown in Table\u00a02). Based on univariate logistic regression analysis, LDH, HRCT pattern, and GPS were selected as candidate risk factors having p\u2009<\u20090.2. We excluded predicted FVC from analysis because of incomplete cohort data. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we reported that GPS 2 was the only predictor significantly associated with incidence of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD (GPS 2 odds ratio [OR], 18.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04\u2013333.49; p\u00a0=\u00a00.046). Although LDH and HRCT pattern exhibited a trend toward association with incidence of AE\u2010ILD, the results were not statistically significant (LDH OR, 0.98; 95% CI: 0.95\u20131.00; p\u00a0=\u00a00.19 | HRCT OR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.049\u201313.68; p\u00a0=\u00a00.88). Chemotherapy regimens are shown in Table\u00a0S2. In our study, all patients received cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide for first\u2010line treatment. The incidence of AE\u2010ILD by first\u2010 and second\u2212/third\u2010line chemotherapy was 6.4% (two patients) and 16% (four patients), respectively. The frequency of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD according to each cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen is summarized in Table\u00a0S3. We reported that the incidence of AE\u2010ILD in topotecan\u2010 and amrubicin\u2010treated groups was 25% (two patients) and 25% (one patient) respectively, both of which are higher than that reported of other drugs (Table\u00a0S3).\n\nFIGURE 1 Incidence of chemotherapy\u2010triggered acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (AE\u2010ILD) in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) according to the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS).

These results indicate that GPS is significantly related with prognosis in patients with ILD associated with SCLC receiving chemotherapy. Next, we determined whether there was a relationship between median OS and individual variables (Table\u00a03). Based on univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, we reported that serum LDH level and GPS 2 were significantly correlated with median OS (LDH hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI: 1.00\u20131.00; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004 | GPS 1 HR, 3.98; 95% CI: 0.99\u201316.00; p\u00a0=\u00a00.051 | GPS 2 HR, 17.29; 95% CI: 3.58\u201383.35; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Following multivariate analyses, we reported that only GPS 2 was independently associated with prognosis after adjusting for LDH and GPS 1 (LDH HR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.99\u20131.00; p\u00a0=\u00a00.11 | GPS 1 HR, 3.76; 95% CI: 0.93\u201315.15; p\u00a0=\u00a00.062 | GPS 2 HR, 13.52; 95% CI: 2.59\u201370.41; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Moreover, we performed the subgroup analysis of survival curve in patients with ED\u2010SCLC. Among these 19 patients, we determined one\u2010year survival and median OS of 38% and 9.8\u00a0months, respectively (Figure\u00a0S2). Further, median OS of patients with GPS 0, 1, and 2 was 13.3, 9.8, and 7.4\u00a0months, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.004; Figure\u00a0S3).\n\nFIGURE 2 Overall survival (OS) rate of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) receiving chemotherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a031)\n\nFIGURE 3 Overall survival (OS) rate of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with SCLC receiving chemotherapy based on the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) group.

The results show that GPS 2 is a significant predictive factor for the incidence of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD; furthermore, we reported that GPS was associated with OS in patients with SCLC and ILD.\n\nThe annual incidence of AE\u2010ILD in patients with GPS 2 was 50.0% (three patients), which was higher than that reported ILD associated with SCLC who received cytotoxic chemotherapy (11.9%\u201336.4%). 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 However, the frequency of AE\u2010ILD within the first year of chemotherapy of 9.5% (two patients) in the GPS 0 subgroup was lower than that previously reported. Based on these results, we propose that using GPS to monitor patients could lead to mitigation of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD risk. Importantly, in a clinical setting, GPS may provide guidance to identify patients tolerant of chemotherapy from those at high risk of AE\u2010ILD.\n\nPreviously, studies reported a median OS ranging from 9.4 to 10.6\u00a0months using platinum\u2010based anticancer agents and etoposide as first\u2010line chemotherapy for patients with ED\u2010SCLC without ILD. 47 , 48 , 49 In our study, the median OS of patients with ED\u2010SCLC and GPS 0 was 13.3\u00a0months, which is comparable to previous results. These data suggest that the risk for ILD exacerbation is low and that chemotherapy is warranted for patients with SCLC and a GPS of 0. Meanwhile, we reported that the median OS of patients with ED\u2010SCLC and GPS 2 was 7.4\u00a0months, a result that indicates worse prognosis than that reported in previous studies. As GPS 2 is a significant predictor of chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD, the poorer prognosis of patients with a GPS of 2 is possibly attributable to AE\u2010ILD. Furthermore, the incidence of AE in second\u2010line and later treatments was higher than that reported in first\u2010line treatment (Figure\u00a0S1). Because there are no established methods currently available for treating chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD and with a mortality of ILD exacerbation between 22% and 27%, 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 patients with ED\u2010SCLC and ILD with a GPS of 2 should receive adequate explanation of risks before receiving chemotherapy and availability of other options to consider such as supportive care especially in second\u2010line or later treatments. Furthermore, caution should be exercised with the use of topotecan because it was associated with an AE incidence of 25%, which is similar to that reported in a previous study. 55 Conversely, carboplatin and paclitaxel are associated with lower AE incidence rates, thus warranting consideration of their use.\n\nThe mechanism underlying the prognostic effect of GPS in patients with ILD associated with lung cancer remains unclear. One possible explanation for the association between high levels of GPS and prognosis is that systemic inflammation and/or malnutrition are contributory factors in chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD. It has been reported that a high serum CRP level, reflecting a state of inflammation, is closely related to AE\u2010ILD. 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 Zhuang et al. suggested that elevated serum CRP was a prognostic factor of hospital mortality in patients with AE\u2010IPF. 63 Furthermore, Minegishi et al. proposed the high levels of CRP as a predictive factor for AE\u2010ILD in patients with ILD associated with lung cancer treated using chemotherapy. 56 Meanwhile, Alb is a negative\u2010phase protein used as a marker of inflammation and nutrition, which has been reported to be associated with mortality of patients with AE\u2010IPF and patients with ILD awaiting transplant. 58 , 65 Moreover, Biyun et al. demonstrated that IPF patients with hypoprealbuminemia have poorer outcome. 66 In our study, GPS 2 is associated with chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD and prognosis in patients with SCLC and pre\u2010existing ILD, thus supporting previous studies. Furthermore, it was proposed that the treatment of inflammation and undernutrition may be effective for preventing AE\u2010ILD and confer improved prognosis for patients with SCLC and ILD.\n\nSome clinical factors, such as age, ECOG PS, and disease stage, are known to impact survival in SCLC patients without ILD. 67 , 68 , 69 However, in the present study, these factors did not prove to be significant prognostic factors. This could be explained by the involvement of ILD. Some studies have suggested that exacerbation of ILD has been associated with the prognosis of SCLC patients with ILD. 26 , 27 In our study, after adjustment for LDH, multivariate analyses revealed that AE\u2010ILD was a prognostic factor (Table\u00a0S4). However, age, ECOG PS, and disease stage were not significant predictive factors for incidence of AE\u2010ILD, which suggests that these factors may fail to predict prognosis. Furthermore, radiotherapy has not been routinely used for the treatment of SCLC patients with ILD, regardless of whether patients are young, have a favorable PS, or have a SCLC classified as a LD. Standard therapy could not be performed in these patients, which may explain the absence of an association between their prognosis and age, EOCG PS, and disease stage. Consistent with the results of our study, previous studies did not find these factors to be significant prognosis predictors in SCLC patients with ILD. 26 , 70 As such, further studies will be required to evaluate the usefulness of clinical factors and GPS as prognostic predictors in SCLC patients with/without ILD.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, this was a nonrandomized retrospective study conducted in a small number of patients, which may have resulted in various biases. However, to date, no large\u2010scale phase 3 studies of pharmacotherapy have been conducted in SCLC patients with ILD. Given the difficulty of conducting prospective studies in this area, our study remains important despite its retrospective nature and small sample size. Furthermore, previous studies had sample sizes ranging from 17 to 59 patients, 22 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 43 and many were as large as our study. Even with such a small sample size, our study identified GPS as a significant marker for predicting the occurrence of AE\u2010ILD and the prognosis of patients with SCLC and ILD. In the future, further large\u2010scale prospective studies are warranted to validate our findings. Second, we had only a single patient with LD\u2010SCLC and a GPS of 1 or 2, respectively. Therefore, we were unable to analyze prognostic differences depending on GPS in patients with LD\u2010SCLC. However, our study revealed an inverse relationship between GPS and median OS in patients with ED\u2010SCLC and ILD. Third, we were unable to include predicted FVC as a variable in logistic regression analyses with the incidence of AE\u2010ILD because six patients in our cohort did not undergo a pulmonary function test; this may introduce selection bias in our results. However, there was no evidence that predicted FVC was a significant predictor of AE\u2010ILD in those patients only who underwent pulmonary function testing before first\u2010line chemotherapy (Table\u00a0S5).\n\nOur study provides evidence of previously unreported associations between GPS and chemotherapy\u2010triggered AE\u2010ILD and prognosis in patients with ILD associated with SCLC. We demonstrated that high GPS serves as a candidate predictor for AE\u2010ILD development. Thus, GPS may provide clinical guidance for identifying patients tolerant of chemotherapy from those with higher risk of treatment\u2010related complications particularly AE\u2010ILD; consequently, GPS may predict the prognosis for patients with ILD associated with SCLC.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\n\nSupporting information\n\nFigure S1.

A brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a contrast-enhancing mass in the optic chiasm, spreading along the left optic tract. The patient underwent a transcranial biopsy of the left optical tract that yielded a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, PET-CT, and bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of systemic lymphoma. Thus, the final diagnosis was of primary central nervous system lymphoma of the optic chiasm. Systemic treatment was initiated with full response. Six months after the end of the treatment, recurrence at cerebellum parenchyma and left tentorium was recorded. A new systemic treatment achieved full response. A second recurrence was noted in an optical coherence tomography of the right eye, 2 years after the initial diagnosis. The patient was treated with intravitreal methotrexate with initial success, but eventual failure after 10 months. Intravitreal rituximab was used with no effect. The patient was then referred to radiotherapy and underwent external beam radiotherapy with VMAT. There were no acute toxicities to report. After the radiotherapy treatment, at 1-year follow-up, the patient has no evidence of disease. Long-term toxicities were recorded and are considered manageable. The present case emphasizes the role of ocular irradiation as an option in the management of intraocular lymphoma patients, including in the salvage setting, with an acceptable ocular toxicity profile.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nAnterior visual pathway lymphoma can occur as a primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL), as an intraocular lymphoma (IOL) associated with a primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) or as a secondary IOL which derives from a systemic lymphoma [1]. PIOL may present independently, prior or subsequent to central nervous system (CNS) involvement [2].\n\nThe incidence of PCNSL is 0.28% per 100,000 persons per year in immunocompetent patients [3, 4]. In these patients, ocular involvement occurs in 15\u201325% of cases, and 80% of these have bilateral involvement [5, 6].\n\nThe prognosis of IOL patients depends on the institution of dedicated ocular therapy in addition to PCNSL therapy; median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are about 18 and 31 months, respectively. Median PFS was prolonged in patients who received dedicated ocular therapy at 19 months as compared to 15 months in those who did not receive dedicated ocular therapy. However, the addition of dedicated ocular therapy had no impact on OS [7].\n\nThe optimal treatment of PIOL has yet to be defined, mainly due to treatment data being limited to small studies and case reports.\n\nHere, we report a case of IOL derived from a PCNSL in an immunocompetent patient, resistant to treatment with intravitreal therapy methotrexate (MTX) and rituximab (RTX) that was successfully salvaged with radiation therapy.\n\nCase Report\n\nA 67-year-old woman presented with decreased vision in both eyes (greater loss in the left eye [LE]), bitemporal hemianopsia and fatigue, with no other symptoms or findings in February 2015. Her past medical history was unremarkable. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass in the optic chiasm, spreading along the left optic tract with homogenous contrast enhancement. Blood tests and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were normal, and CSF cytology was negative for malignancy. Symptomatic therapy with corticosteroids was initiated achieving clinical resolution of the bitemporal hemianopsia and improving the LE best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from 6/30 to 20/40. The patient underwent a transcranial biopsy of the left optical tract, and microscopic examination revealed a lymphoid cell infiltrate composed of predominantly medium to large cells with irregular hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm in the background of smaller more monomorphic populations of lymphoid cells. Large cells were CD20+, small cells were CD3+. The malignant B-lymphocytes were MUM1+, BCL2+, CD10\u2013, and BCL6\u2013. The findings were compatible with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the CNS. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of systemic lymphoma. Thus, the final diagnosis was of PCNSL of the optic chiasm.\n\nTreatment with R-MVP (five cycles), RTX (500 mg/m2), MTX (3,5 g/m2), procarbazine (100 mg/m2/day), and vincristine (1.4 mg/m2) was initiated in March 2015. After three cycles, the patient developed Pneumocystis pneumonia with the need of ventilatory support, and the treatment was stopped. A brain MRI showed full resolution of the chiasm lesion, and the patient was maintained in vigilance. In August 2015, a follow-up brain MRI showed an occipital periventricular lesion with contrast enhancement, and no signs of disease at the optic chiasm. No other evidence of disease was found. Treatment with R-MVP was re-initiated to a total of 5 cycles. In November 2015, a brain MRI showed imaging complete response and consolidation treatment (two cycles) with citarabine (3 g/m2/day) was initiated. The patient maintained imaging follow-up with no evidence of disease.\n\nIn July 2016, the patient presented with meningeal signs and headache; CSF analysis revealed a monoclonal B lymphocyte population (CD20+, CD5-) in 0.35% of the sample, and a brain MRI showed contrast enhancement compatible with active disease in the cerebellum parenchyma and left tentorium; no systemic disease was found.\n\nTherapy was initiated (5 cycles) with RTX (500 mg/m2), MTX (3.5 g/m2), and alternate weekly intra-CSF MTX (7.5 mg/m2). Complete remission was achieved in CSF and Brain MRI. RTX (500 mg/m2) was continued, and in January 2018, after the 10th cycle, there was no macroscopic evidence of disease (CSF, MRI, and PET scan).\n\nIn March 2018, the patient complained of photophobia and pain in the right eye (RE). The ophthalmologic examination revealed an anterior chamber cellular reaction (+2 Tyndall), vitritis, and a temporal yellow subretinal plaque on fundoscopy. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed revealing retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) undulation, suggestive of subretinal cellular infiltration (shown in Fig. 1). RE panuveitis was diagnosed, and a vitreous biopsy was performed, revealing NHL B cells. No macroscopic disease was found on a brain and optic tract MRI. The patient continued RTX (500 mg/m2) until completion of 12 cycles and initiated intravitreal treatment with MTX (400 \u03bcg/0.1 mL) bi-weekly (8 cycles), then weekly (4 cycles), and then monthly.\n\nAfter the first two intravitreal injections, opthalmologic examination was negative for cellular inflammation in both anterior chamber and vitreous, and although the patient developed macular edema, evidence of subretinal infiltration was no longer visible in consecutive OCTs. In January 2019, after 10 monthly cycles of intravitreal therapy, a worsening in the control OCT with RPE undulation, indicated probable disease progression (with no macroscopic evidence on MRI), and the patient was proposed to receive 4 weekly cycles of intraocular RTX (1 mg/0.1 mL).\n\nIn April of 2019, patient's BCVA of the RE was 20/50 and LE 20/30 with no cellular anterior chamber reaction but with central vitritis (2+) at fundoscopy and RPE undulation showing no signs of improvement at the follow-up OCT. Because there was no evidence of clinical improvement after intravitreal treatment with RTX, the patient returned to weekly MTX intravitreal injections and was referred to radiotherapy. A new evaluation revealed no macroscopic evidence of disease (CSF and MRI). The patient underwent external beam radiotherapy with VMAT, a total of 24 Gy in 12 fractions was given to both eyes and the optic tract, a subsequent boost up to 36 Gy in 18 fractions was given to the RE, right optic nerve, chiasm, and right optic tract. There were no acute toxicities related to the treatment.\n\nAt 12 months of follow-up, there is no evidence of ocular recurrence (Fig. 2) and a brain MRI also showed no signs of disease. At the last ophthalmologic examination, as a probable consequence of radiotherapy, the patient presented with an RE diffuse superficial punctate keratitis that was managed with ocular lubricant. Her current RE BCVA is 20/100 and LE 20/25. Due to presence of a RE nuclear cataract and refractory macular edema, the patient is scheduled to have RE phacoemulsification surgery with a simultaneous injection of a sustained-release dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex\u00ae).\n\nDiscussion\n\nGiven the rarity of IOL, there is a lack of prospective randomized trials that establish a standard therapy. Currently treatment is influenced by disease degree, CNS involvement, and the general performance status of patients [8]. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and intravitreal chemotherapy are all available, either used alone or in combination. Retrospective data seems to indicate that treatment of IOL, regardless of CNS involvement should include some form of local therapy, such as intraocular chemotherapy or ocular radiation as this increases disease-free survival in these patients [7].\n\nSome authors have recommended high-dose intravenous MTX, but doubts remain around the concentration of MTX in the anterior chamber due to the limited penetration of systemic chemotherapy into the eye due to the existence of blood-ocular barriers [9]. As an alternative, intravitreal chemotherapy with MTX is nowadays widely used with most reports and case series showing prolonged remission with maintenance of visual function and minimal complications from the injections [1, 10, 11]. MTX can also be used in combination with other medications, such as thiotepa and dexamethasone [1]. Recent reports indicate that the combination of systemic high-dose MTX with intravitreal MTX is associated with a CNS disease-free survival at 2 years of 58.3%, although polychemotherapy is also associated with higher drug toxicity [1, 11]. Intravitreal chemotherapy with 0.4 mg MTX in 0.1 mL, has thus been used in persistent IOL [12]. But drug resistance can arise with prolonged use, as it has probably happened in this case. As an alternative to intravitreous MTX, intravitreal RTX has been used, either to decrease the frequency of treatments with MTX or in MTX-resistant patients [13].\n\nOcular irradiation has been widely used in IOL, with or without concomitant prophylactic CNS treatment, and doses ranging from 30 to 50 Gy have been reported with rapid improvement of patient's symptoms [1, 9]. Exclusive ocular irradiation toxicities include radiation retinopathy, vitreous hemorrhage, dry eye syndrome, conjunctivitis, neovascular glaucoma, optic atrophy, punctate epithelial erosions, and cataract [1].\n\nIn this case, the patient had PCNSL with multiple relapses, treated with systemic chemotherapy. The last relapse was an IOL with no other evidence of disease. Given the favorable toxicities profile, intravitreous MTX therapy was initiated with initial success, but eventual failure. RTX was used as the ocular disease appeared to be MTX resistant, but with no evidence of clinical improvement. The patient was then referred to radiotherapy, with good results in local control, no evidence of disease present in the follow-up examinations and manageable toxicities. The dose used in this patient, up to 36 Gy, is well below the Quantec limits of 55 Gy (<3% of probability of optic neuropathy) for the optical pathways and chiasma, and well below the limits for brain parenchyma of 60 Gy (<3% of probability of radionecrosis) [14].\n\nAlthough other systemic and intravitreal therapies are associated with less toxicity and should be considered as a first line of treatment, ocular irradiation should be regarded as an option in the management of IOL patients, including in the salvage setting, with an acceptable ocular toxicity profile.\n\nStatement of Ethics\n\nThe patient in question has given written informed consent for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\nFunding Sources\n\nNo funding was solicited for this case report.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nRaul Cola\u00e7o \u2212 intern that followed the case during the radiotherapy treatment, drafting of the case report.

    "fulltext_processed": "TITLE:\nClozapine-Induced Pericardial Effusion Presenting with Persistent Tachycardia.\n\nABSTRACT:\nClozapine is an atypical antipsychotic used in refractory schizophrenia and depression. Its use is often complicated by its vast side-effect profile including cardiovascular reactions, agranulocytosis, and seizures. Specifically, the cardiac complications of clozapine have been shown to predominantly cause myocarditis and pericarditis. In this case report, the case of a 58-year-old male being treated for treatment-resistant depression and schizophrenia who suffers from tachycardia is presented. He is treated empirically for orthostatic hypotension with IV fluids without much success. Further imaging and echocardiography demonstrated a pericardial effusion, a rare reaction (\u22641\u2009:\u200910000) that has only been documented in a handful of case reports. This anecdotal evidence highlights the significance of polyserositis/pericardial effusion in the context of clozapine-induced orthostatic hypotension resistant to rehydration. When starting a patient on clozapine, it is important to consider further workup and monitoring with laboratory baseline biomarkers and cardiac evaluation with symptomatic individuals. Upon immediate cessation of clozapine, the pericardial effusion should spontaneously resolve without complication and should not be rechallenged.\n\nTEXT:\npmc1. Introduction\n\nClozapine has been significant in its efficacy as an antipsychotic drug for treatment-resistant psychotic depression [1]. Despite its lower risk of tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms, its use as an effective agent has been limited and complicated by its adverse side-effect profile. The most severe side effects include agranulocytosis, respiratory depression, and seizures [2]. However, there have been multiple uncommon adverse cardiovascular effects noted with its use, including hypotension, cardiac conduction abnormalities, tachycardia, myocarditis, polyserositis, and pericarditis [3, 4]. In particular, there have been very few reports of clozapine-induced pericardial effusion; hence, it is often disregarded as a potential etiology. In this report, we present a 58-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who is treated with clozapine and has a subsequent moderate pericardial effusion and orthostatic hypotension. We will discuss the initial clinical management and diagnostic rule out during admission, as well as the resolution with immediate discontinuation of the medication.\n\n2. Case Presentation\n\nA 58-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, and panic disorder was admitted to inpatient psychiatry with symptoms of suicidal ideation and auditory hallucinations. He had failed trials of multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics. A month into his admission, due to treatment-resistant depression, he was started on clozapine 100\u2009mg PO BID and lithium 300\u2009mg PO daily. 12 days after the initiation of the medications, he developed the new onset of tachycardia ranging between 110\u2013130s bpm and had a brief febrile episode of 102.5\u2009F a couple days later. He underwent a U/A which showed cloudy urine with moderate leukocyte esterase, white blood cells 15\u201330, and few bacteria. The patient at the time did not note any dysuria or other urinary complaints.\n\nHe was initially recommended admission and started oral ciprofloxacin, which was immediately switched to IV ceftriaxone x3 days for a presumptive diagnosis of UTI. At initial evaluation, he was empirically treated with a bolus of IV fluids for orthostatic hypotension (supine 115/72, upright 103/59\u2009mmHg). On admission, chest X-ray demonstrated no acute findings (Figure 1) and EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 109 bpm with low-voltage QRS. His basic metabolic panel, TSH, fT4, and complete blood count were unremarkable as well. During his stay, he continued to have persistent tachycardia with a peak of 153 bpm despite completing the antibiotic regimen and IV fluids. Given his persistent tachycardia and concern for thrombus, he underwent a CTA chest (Figure 2) with contrast which demonstrated moderate pericardial effusion with subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes. Given the low-voltage QRS findings, he also had a TEE performed which demonstrated grossly normal LV function with small pericardial effusion present, without evidence of tamponade. A repeat EKG demonstrated similar sinus tachycardia at a rate of 118 bpm with low-voltage QRS. For the duration of admission, he had no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or discomfort.\n\nThere was a discussion with the psychiatry team regarding concerns for the vast side effects from recently prescribed clozapine vs. moderate dehydration. He received more IV fluids, and clozapine was promptly discontinued. Infectious disease was consulted, and further workup demonstrated negative coxsackie B but a positive coxsackie A virus with titers 1\u2009:\u2009800. This was a confounding etiology for the pericardial effusion, despite limited literature supporting coxsackie A as a cause for a pericardial effusion. Blood and urine cultures were negative at the time as well. Although after discussion, alternative etiologies such as SLE, uremia, or malignancy were considered, limited clinical suspicion rendered further workup unnecessary at that time. Given the subacute presentation in the setting of a probable offending medication, idiopathic etiology was deemed less likely.\n\nOnly 3 days after discontinuation of clozapine, his tachycardia had spontaneously resolved, and a repeat EKG showed a resolved normal sinus rhythm at 91\u2009bpm with normal QRS voltage. No treatment of the pericarditis was initiated given the presumed cause related to a medication adverse effect. His vitals continued to remain stable, and he was subsequently discharged home.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nClozapine is an atypical antipsychotic which is often used as a last resort in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The dangerous side-effect profile includes agranulocytosis, seizures, respiratory depression, and a multitude of cardiovascular complications [2, 4]. This particular case is of interest, as there are only a handful of reported cases of pericardial effusion (polyserositis) and fewer still with concomitant orthostatic hypotension. According to the American College of Cardiology, there is a\u2009\u2264\u20091\u2009:\u2009100 risk of suffering from the adverse effect of orthostatic hypotension. Despite myocarditis/pericarditis being \u22641\u2009:\u200910000 risk, pericardial effusion was still not established as an adverse outcome [4]. As per French imputability of casualty assessment, this reaction received a designation of C1S3I2B2. This case report highlights the importance of careful cardiac monitoring in patients that are taking clozapine.\n\nThere are no published guidelines for managing and monitoring associated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and pericarditis outcomes from clozapine. However, there is well-documented evidence that markers including CRP, ESR, troponins, BNP, and echocardiography are all potentially useful in evaluating a baseline prior to regimen initiation [4]. In our case specifically, inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP were not obtained. Having baseline reference labs could have expedited the prediction of the underlying etiology of pericardial effusion/pericarditis. In addition, leukocytosis is another marker of pericardial syndrome. This was not identified during our patient's hospital course, despite evidence of multiple other case reports with these findings [4, 5]. Some studies have shown the onset of eosinophilia may also predict cardiac outcomes associated with clozapine [4]. In patient outcomes of sudden cardiac death, there were found to be cardiac eosinophilic infiltrates with myocytolysis, attributed to a hypersensitivity drug reaction [6]. However, in this report, eosinophils in serum remained stable and within normal limits for the duration of admission. Despite strong evidence for using laboratory biomarkers in identifying a pericardial complication, they may not always be present. This may necessitate the use of further imaging studies to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nDuring presentation of subacute tachycardia without any apparent pathology, in the context of clozapine initiation, a more robust cardiac evaluation with necessary imaging is likely to be beneficial. Given that the adverse effect of pericardial effusion can manifest at any point, from one week to years after treatment initiation, serious considerations for monitoring should be taken [7]. By obtaining a TEE early in the treatment course, we were able to obtain a timely and definitive diagnosis. This allowed for prompt discontinuation of clozapine and helped avoid any severe forms of pericardial tamponade, a potentially fatal complication. Spontaneous resolution of the effusion, as seen in our case, can also be seen in many other studies [4, 7, 8]. The 9.1 to 17.4\u2009hr half-life of clozapine corresponds well with the several-day resolution seen following cessation of the drug [9].\n\nThe mechanism of the various clozapine-associated cardiovascular side effects is not well understood. Researchers have suggested sympathetic hyperactivity, decreased vagal tone, and cholinergic and adrenergic inhibition as potential causes. Since there is a lack of trials to demonstrate these pathophysiologies, studies that further elucidate the adverse effects and potential intervention and prevention strategies will be particularly valuable [10].\n\nFollowing cessation, recommendations include careful supportive care only [11]. Follow-up EKG has been noted in prior studies, but despite lack of an evidence-based criterion, this is at the provider's discretion [7]. A literature review found that patients rechallenged with clozapine after agranulocytosis and myocarditis had poorer outcomes [12].\n\nAn important takeaway from this case was that nonspecific tachycardia in the context of recent clozapine initiation should be closely monitored for an extended spectrum of cardiac toxicity. This should include preliminary laboratory markers for inflammation and leukocytosis (specifically eosinophilia). If IV fluids do not resuscitate the orthostasis, prompt evaluation with TEE should be considered to allow for quick discontinuation of the offending agent, clozapine.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nPO: Per os (by mouth)\n\nBID: Bis in die (twice daily)\n\nU/A: Urinary analysis\n\nUTI: Urinary tract infection\n\nEKG: Electrocardiogram\n\nIV: Intravenous\n\nCTA: Computerized tomography angiography\n\nTSH: Thyroid-stimulating hormone\n\nfT4: Free thyroxine\n\nLV: Left ventricle\n\nBP: Blood pressure\n\nTEE: Transesophageal echocardiogram\n\nCRP: C-reactive protein\n\nESR: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\nBNP: Basic natriuretic peptide\n\nSLE: Systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nData Availability\n\nData are available on request.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\nFigure 1 Frontal (a) and lateral (b) chest X-ray images demonstrating no abnormalities or signs of pericardial effusion.\n\nFigure 2 CTA chest with (a) and without (b) contrast enhancement demonstrating the moderate pericardial effusion.

It is difficult to diagnose neurotoxicity from anesthetics because of the large number of possible diagnoses. In this case report, careful monitoring by neurological examinations helped to diagnose local neurotoxicity caused after epidural anesthesia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 41-year-old pregnant woman who underwent emergency cesarean delivery under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia suffered left leg paralysis after surgery. Multiple neurological examinations (e.g., electromyography, nerve conduction study) revealed that the paralysis was induced by the neurotoxicity of ropivacaine. The neurological examinations were also useful to monitor the recovery process.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first clinical case report that describes the diagnosis of and recovery from local anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity monitored by electromyography and nerve conduction study. Neurological disorders caused by regional anesthetics should be carefully examined and diagnosed using these neurological examinations.\n\nTEXT:\npmcBackground\n\nNeurotoxic injury associated with regional anesthesia is a rare but serious problem. The pathophysiology of spinal cord injury associated with regional anesthesia is divided into mechanical trauma, vascular injury, and neurotoxicity from local anesthetic [1]. Neurotoxicity is an anesthesia-related nerve injury that can occur as an isolated event or in conjunction with physical injury to the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots [2].\n\nLocal anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity is possibly associated with mitochondria dysfunction and activation of the apoptosis pathway [3]. Pathological conditions can be induced by local anesthetics, such as lidocaine and tetracaine, and to a lesser extent bupivacaine and ropivacaine [4]. Ropivacaine is considered to be a safe local anesthetic [5, 6]; however, we encountered one case of serious neurotoxic injury associated with epidural ropivacaine. Neurotoxicity from a local anesthetic is rare and hard to diagnose. Chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity is known to be monitored with neurological examinations [7, 8]; however, anesthesiologists are not familiar with the examinations used to examine neurological disorders. Here, we used electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction study (NCS), and needle EMG to identify the site of neurological injury. The examinations were useful to make a diagnosis and to follow the recovery of neurological function. This is the first case report of neurotoxicity from a local anesthetic followed by regular electrophysiological evaluations.\n\nCase presentation\n\nWe received written permission from the patient to publish this report. A 41-year-old pregnant woman (height 157\u2009cm, weight 60\u2009kg) was diagnosed with fetal distress and underwent emergency cesarean delivery. She was at 40\u2009weeks of gestation and had no problems during pregnancy. A preoperative examination found a normal platelet count and coagulopathy. The platelet count was 1.62 \u00d7\u2009105/mm3, the international normalized ratio of prothrombin time was 1.03, and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 29.2\u2009s. Anesthesia was induced with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia under left lateral decubitus position. Spinal anesthesia was performed using a 27-G Quincke spinal needle, and the first trial was successful. 2.4\u2009mL of isobaric 0.5% bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space at L4/5. The epidural catheter was placed at the L4/5 intervertebral space with a Tuohy needle. There were no immediate complications such as paresthesia or bleeding at this point. After spinal anesthesia, the patient had loss of sensation from Th6 to S5. Cesarean delivery was performed rapidly and the delivery went smoothly with an operation time of 45\u2009min. Continuous epidural anesthesia was started at the end of the surgery at 4\u2009mL/h. The epidural anesthesia was a mixture of ropivacaine (0.2%, 200\u2009mL) and fentanyl (16\u2009mL, 0.8\u2009mg). Postoperative loss of sensation from Th6 to S5 did not change when going back to the recovery room. The next day, the dose of continuous epidural anesthesia was reduced to 2\u2009mL/h, at which point we confirmed that she could move her legs. However, she claimed to feel surgical pain, and the dose was raised back up to 4\u2009mL/h. After 3\u00a0h, she became unable to move the bilateral lower limbs. The continuous infusion of epidural anesthesia was suspended 25\u2009h after surgery (post-operative day (POD) 1); yet, sensory and motor disturbance persisted in the left lower extremity into POD2. We removed the epidural catheter, but paralysis remained.\n\nWe consulted with a neurologist doctor to identify the cause of paralysis on POD2. Manual muscle test (MMT) performed in the lower limb muscle resulted with a score below 3 7\u00a0days post operation (Table\u00a01). Tendon reflex in the left lower limb was absent while it was normal in the right lower limb. Babinski reflex, which is suggestive of pyramidal tract impairment, was negative in both legs. There were several possible diagnoses such as mechanical spinal injury, spinal cord infarction, brain infarction, and spinal cord hematoma. Spinal and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed that there was no apparent cerebrospinal bleeding, infarction, or mechanical injury, but mechanical nerve injury could not be completely excluded. Neurological examination revealed lower left extremity listlessness and paresthesia, which deteriorated at the distal limb. EMG, which evaluates peripheral nerve injury as well as nerve root injury, showed impaired F wave appearance (Fig.\u00a01). F wave is a response to antidromic activation of the motor neuron. NCS, which measures nerve conduction velocity in sensory and motor nerves, revealed that impairment of the sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV) was more severe than that of the motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV). SCV in the left fibula, posterior tibia, and sural nerve were markedly lower. Needle EMG, which records spontaneous muscle contraction, showed the left tibia anterior muscle had no action potential, and left quadriceps and right tibia anterior muscles had decreased maximum interference patterns (Fig.\u00a01).Table 1 Lower limb muscle strength evaluated by manual muscle test.

Needle EMG (lower) shows no contraction and no action potential were recorded in the left tibial anterior muscle as well as impaired contraction in the right tibial anterior muscle. Lt tibia ant, left tibial anterior muscle; Rt tibia ant, right tibial anterior muscle\n\nWe considered possible diagnoses such as mechanical injury, epidural hematoma, spinal cord infarction, brain hemorrhage, delayed allergy, autoimmune disease, suppression by compression stocking, and neurotoxicity by bupivacaine. Mechanical nervous injury, epidural hematoma, and spinal cord infarction were excluded by spinal MRI. Brain hemorrhage and infarction were excluded by brain MRI plus computed tomography. Bilateral nerve impairment on EMG and the range of neurological manifestations negatively correlated with mechanical injury. Delayed-type hypersensitivity, known as type IV allergy, was excluded because of a negative result on a drug-induced lymphocyte test. Autoimmune diseases, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and Miller Fisher syndrome, were excluded by the negative results from anti-GM1IgG and anti-GQ1bIgG antibody tests. Spinal cord neurotoxicity from bupivacaine, which was used for spinal anesthesia during surgery, was an important differential diagnosis in this patient. However, the confirmation of the movement of her lower limbs post-operation and the fact that the dose increase of continuous ropivacaine worsened the motor nerve disorder suggested there was no neurotoxicity from bupivacaine. Furthermore, absence of bladder rectal disorder and the range of neurological defect (L5 to L3, only left side) were also helpful in excluding neurotoxicity from bupivacaine.\n\nAfter excluding the various possible diagnoses discussed above (mechanical injury, epidural hematoma, spinal cord infarction, brain hemorrhage, delayed allergy, autoimmune disease, mechanical suppression, and neurotoxicity by spinal anesthesia), the neurologist suggested a diagnosis of neurotoxicity from ropivacaine. The patient immediately began rehabilitation with physical therapies such as range of motion exercises, walking training, muscle strengthening exercises, and basic activity training. The neurological deficiency lasted for 50\u2009days after surgery, after which small F waves appeared in the SCV simultaneously with clinical recovery (Fig.\u00a02). MMT and basic activity recovered consistently with EMG recovery (Table\u00a01). The EMG amplitude also increased over time. Tenacious rehabilitation was remarkably effective for the recovery of neurological disorder and she still has a little paresis but became able to walk by herself.Fig. 2 F wave frequency and needle EMG of the left tibia anterior muscle during the recovery process. POD indicates post-operative days. POD54 (left), POD106 (middle), and POD162 (right). This data clearly demonstrate that neurological disorder recovered gradually with time passes\n\nConclusion\n\nThis case report has two important findings for anesthesiologists. First, neurological detailed examination with EMG is useful to identify the site of neurological disorder after epidural anesthesia. Second, a neurological deficiency caused by neurotoxicity from local anesthesia does not readily recover, but continuous rehabilitation is beneficial for recovery.\n\nIn this case, EMG allowed the regional diagnosis of the neurological deficiency. A low SCV indicates myelin sheath damage and decreased EMG amplitude indicates axonal degeneration. The F wave, which is used to evaluate polyneuropathies [9], was also useful for assessing a neurological deficiency from ropivacaine-induced neurotoxicity. Needle EMG excluded a diagnosis of a bilateral neurological disorder from physical pressure caused by inadequate positioning. In addition, a pattern of degeneration in drug-induced neurotoxicity [10] known as \u201cdying back\u201d was observed. Impairment of sensory neurons was observed in the tibia peroneal and femoral nerves. Anesthesia-induced neurological deficiency usually appears on both legs; however, in this patient, neurological deficiency was much worse in the left leg than in the right. This abnormal event may be due to the placement of the epidural catheter more to the left side. These neurological observations and careful examination by EMG helped resolve the conclusive diagnosis. There are cases of neurological disorders after epidural anesthesia that are not diagnosed. This case emphasizes the importance of careful examination and monitoring by anesthesiologists for neurological deficiencies after epidural anesthesia. In addition, tenacious rehabilitation is important for recovery of neurological disorder with local anesthetics.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nEMG Electromyography\n\nMMT Manual muscle test\n\nMCV Motor nerve conduction velocity\n\nNCS Nerve conduction study\n\nPOD Post-operative day\n\nSCV Sensory nerve conduction velocity\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Hiroshi Shoji for careful neurological tests, diagnosis, and advises.

The renal biopsy revealed endothelial cell swelling, focal reduplication of glomerular basement membrane, and narrowed capillary lumens with fibrin deposition and fragmented erythrocytes which are compatible with thrombotic microangiopathies. The patient was presented with organ injury, acute renal failure with the need for hemodialysis technique. The patient recovered after the appropriate treatment. Continuous observation of renal function during gemcitabine treatment regularly and withdrawal of treatment if acute kidney injury occurs is essential as acute kidney injury along with thrombotic microangiopathies may prove to be life-threatening.\n\nTEXT:\nIntroduction\n\nThrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are microvascular occlusive diseases caused by mechanical damage of erythrocytes and platelet aggregation. The disorder is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and different grades of organs injuries (cardiac, neurological, and acute renal failure) resulting from systemic microvascular thrombi. Primary TMA diseases are classified into (1) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), in their acquired and congenital (Upshaw\u2013Schulman syndrome) types, and (2) hemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome (HUS), related to infection caused by Shiga toxin\u2013producing infectious agent and the atypical HUS related to uncontrolled alternative pathways activation of complement activation. The secondary TMAs are associated with severe preeclampsia in pregnant women and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome. It is also induced by the autoimmune disease, systemic infections (H1N1, HIV), organ transplantations, and some drugs. The TMA incidence in cancer patients is rare; however, it has severe consequences.1\n\nThe TMA in cancer patients is caused by two major reasons. First, the cancer itself may cause TMA by bone marrow or systemic microvascular metastases and second using common oncotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy may induce TMA either by dose-dependent toxicity or acute immune-mediated reaction. Gemcitabine, a chemotherapy drug, is a nucleoside analogue which is used against several types of cancers such as ovarian, breast, pancreatic, bladder, sarcoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer. However, gemcitabine has several major side effects such as myelosuppression, respiratory failure, mild liver dysfunction, elevated blood pressure, and gastroenterological symptoms. The incidence of gemcitabine-induced TMA ranges between 0.015% and 0.30%. The majority patients develop TMA between 1 and 2\u2009months of last infusion.2,3 At present no standard guidelines are available for managing gemcitabine-induced TMA.\n\nCase\n\nA 65-year-old female patient was presented at the emergency center of Hannover Medical School in November 2019 with the symptoms of increasing bilateral leg swelling, dizziness, fatigue, and dyspnea. The patient had a history of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma and breast cancer. In October 2016, the patient was first diagnosed with pleomorphic sarcoma (G3) in the left gluteal region with lung metastasis. The primary tumor and the metastases were removed followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. From March 2019, she was treated with doxorubicin and bevacizumab for relapsing metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. The patient was treated for five treatment cycles (approximately 4\u2009months) followed by computed tomographic (CT) scan in July 2019. The patient was presented with mucositis and severe hematotoxicity. Therefore, and due to disease progression, the treatment regime was changed to gemcitabine and docetaxel for two cycles with a cumulative dosage of 1800\u2009mg/m2 of gemcitabine. In September 2019, cancer staging showed stability of the disease. But due to suspected drug hematotoxicity, the treatment was reduced. The patient continued to receive the therapy in reduced dose for three cycles with a cumulative dose of 2025\u2009mg/m2 gemcitabine till October 2019. In addition, in March 2017, the patient was also diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer left breast with lung metastasis. The histology revealed invasive lobular type of breast cancer. In May 2017, mastectomy was performed to remove the tissue. The patient is currently being treated for breast cancer with tamoxifen since September 2018.\n\nDuring the emergency arrival, the initial assessment of the patient showed the blood pressure as 170/93\u2009mm\u2009Hg, temperature as 37.1\u00b0C with 95% oxygen saturation while breathing in the ambient air. The physical examination showed peripheral edema and weakened breath sounds bilaterally. The laboratory examination revealed the platelet count as 88\u2009\u00d7\u2009103\u2009\u03bcL, hemoglobin as 5.9\u2009g/dL, and leucocytes count of 12\u2009\u00d7\u2009103\u2009\u03bcL. Serum creatinine level was 472\u2009\u03bcmol/L, serum potassium was 4.4\u2009mmol/L, and serum sodium was 119\u2009mmol/L. The patient was admitted due to severe anemia and acute renal failure and thus was treated with fluids and blood transfusion. Blood test investigation was done for anemia studies which showed the hemoglobin level as 5.9\u2009g/dL (post transfusion hemoglobin 7.9\u2009g/dL), haptoglobin\u2009<\u20090.1\u2009g/L, and lactate dehydrogenase level as 1510\u2009U/L. Furthermore, the negative direct antiglobulin test and high schistocytes count on blood smear were diagnosed as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and anuric renal failure thus led to TMA diagnosis. Also, there was no diarrhea or any other symptoms suggesting any infection. The antinuclear antibody (ANA), extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), C3, C4 test for diagnosing any autoimmune conditions were found to be within the normal level. After 24\u2009h, the ADAMTS13 test results showed normal range, thus diagnosis of TTP was ruled out.\n\nAfter diagnosis, treatment with methylprednisolone with 1\u2009mg/kg dose per day was given to the patient. Renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis along with histological alterations compatible with involvement of TMA at initial acute phase. CT scan and bone marrow biopsy done were also done during the hospital stay to rule out any disease progression or bone marrow infiltration being cancer cells. According to the CT finding and bone marrow biopsy, there was no significant tumor progression or no bone marrow infiltration, respectively. Regardless of well-established treatment, the patient showed signs of anuria with unfavorable blood test results. Anuria conditions led to first session of hemodialysis. The anemic state was increased at a slow rate; therefore, red-cell transfusion was not performed after third day of admission. There was no need of transfusion for the platelet count. The patient showed progressive improvement of the symptoms after the hemodialysis. Renal failure of the patient showed slow improvement, with recovery of diuresis on third week and requirement of hemodialysis session for 6\u2009weeks. The major laboratory findings are shown in Table 1. The patient was discharged after 28\u2009days of admission. The timeline of the patient cancer history and TMA treatment is presented in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

The drug-induced secondary TMA is caused by chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine, mitomycin C, and cisplatin.1 In our present case report, the female patient with history of malignancy was treated using gemcitabine, which is compatible with the secondary TMA. The TMA in the patient may have been triggered or complicated due to some other glomerular condition, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous nephropathy. Second, there was rapid increase in the Adenylate kinase isoenzyme1 (AKI) of serum creatinine level of the patient. Rapid progress in AKI may cause fatal organ failure and irreparable end-stage renal disease. Due to these conclusions, renal biopsy was done in the presented patient. The findings from renal biopsy specimen were compatible with the TMA.\n\nGemcitabine can cause direct injuries in the endothelium and thus may lead to TMA in cancer patients. Till date, the comprehensive mechanism of drug-induced TMA is not known, but prostacyclin or prostaglandin I2 is thought to decrease von Willebrand factor secretion, with endothelial cell injury and subsequent aggregation of platelet. TMA is generally induced after 5\u20138\u2009months post treatment. One of the most common clinical symptoms reported post-gemcitabine treatment of TMA is newly developed hypertension.3,4 In the present case, the patient also showed the elevated blood pressure. Gemcitabine-induced TMA is treated by its discontinuation, dialysis, and anti-hypertensive therapy. Generally, it is enough to eliminate the TMA-inducing drug from the treatment protocol for resolving renal and hematological issues.3 In the present case, patient showed significant improvement after 2\u2009months of gemcitabine cessation. The therapeutic options with plasmapherese or eculizumab have a limited success in the treatment of gemcitabine-induced TMA. Similar cases of gemcitabine-induced TMA in three different patients with the symptoms of chronic renal impairment, shock, hemolytic anemia, and other symptoms were previously reported by a retrospective study. These patients were also treated by ceasing the use of gemcitabine and performing dialysis with other required treatment. The renal functionality slowly recovered in these patients. But two patients eventually died due to other severe complications of TMA and one patient survived after intensive care. Thus, early diagnosis of TMA and intensive care of patients with drug-induced TMA are significant in cancer patients.5\n\nAfter weighing up the risk\u2013benefit ratio and due to poor prognosis of the patient, we treated her conservatively. Despite the established treatment, the persistent anuria condition led to perform first hemodialysis session. At the hematological level, anemia increased very gradually; thus, red-cell transfusion was not required after the third day of admission. After the hemodialysis, the patient showed progressive improvement in the symptoms. Renal failure was slowly improved, and diuresis was recovered in the second week. The hemodialysis session was required till the last day of hospital stay. Despite metastases and palliative situation, the dialysis for 6\u2009weeks led to recovery of renal function. As TMA was diagnosed comparatively early in the present patient, she was able to recover and thus improving her quality of life as compared to above-reported similar patients who died due TMA complications. After the improvement of renal function and due to the patient request, hemodialysis was discontinued after 6\u2009weeks. The chemotherapy was changed to palliative therapy with pazopanib.\n\nConclusion\n\nTimely diagnosis of drug-induced toxicity and TMA is important for proper metastatic cancer treatment and to evade probable drug toxicity.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nsj-docx-1-sco-10.1177_2050313X211013208 \u2013 Supplemental material for A rare case report of gemcitabine-induced thrombotic microangiopathies\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\nSupplemental material, sj-docx-1-sco-10.1177_2050313X211013208 for A rare case report of gemcitabine-induced thrombotic microangiopathies by Mohammed Ali Madkhali in SAGE Open Medical Case Reports\n\nDeclaration of conflicting interests: The author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nEthical approval: Our institution does not require ethical approval for reporting individual cases or case series.\n\nFunding: The author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nInformed consent: Written informed consent from the patient was documented prior to the publication of this case report.
