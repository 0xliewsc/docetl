Another patient, managing diabetes, finds Tylenol and ibuprofen ineffective for recurrent headaches triggered by stress, suggesting frustration with its efficacy. Additionally, reports of shoulder pain indicate Tylenol helps relieve pain but does not eliminate it entirely. Patients have taken Tylenol in combination with ibuprofen and other medications like muscle relaxants to manage pain, highlighting its limited effectiveness as a standalone treatment. Consequently, some patients report no significant relief and express frustration or dissatisfaction with its efficacy, particularly in high pain scenarios. Side effects mentioned include slight liver enzyme elevations potentially influenced by Tylenol usage combined with other medications, and no new major adverse effects have been noted other than previous mentions of nausea in high-pain episodes and lack of effectiveness for some patients.
