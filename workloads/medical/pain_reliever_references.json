okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?\n[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .\n[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?\n[patient] yeah , just a little strain .\n[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?\n[patient] uh , yes .\n[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .\n[patient] i see .\n[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?\n[patient] i think that sounds good to me .\n[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .\n[patient] uh , no , i do n't .\n[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?\n[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .\n[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?\n[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .\n[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .\n[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .\n[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?\n[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .\n[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .\n[patient] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .\n[patient] all right . is the mri today ?\n[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] all right . well , it was nice meeting you , my friend .\n[patient] you as well . thank you .\n[doctor] physical exam , elderly white gentleman presents in a wheelchair . no apparent distress . per the template , down through neuro- neurologic . one plus bilateral biceps . triceps brachioradialis . reflexes bilateral all negative . follow up and take out the lower extremities . gait not assessed today . strength and sensation is per the template . uh , upper and lower extremities . musculoskeletal , he is non-tender over his cervical spine . he does have mildly restricted cervical exte- extension . right and left lateral rotation which is symmetric , which gives him mild lateral neck pain but no radi- radicular pain . spurling's maneuver is benign .\n[doctor] paragraph , diagnostics . cervical x-ray 6421 . cervical x-ray reveals significant disc degeneration at c56 , and to a lower extent c45 and c34 . significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy c67 and c7-t1 is difficult to visualize in the current x-rays .\n[doctor] paragraph , impression . number one , left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radicularopathy . possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy . number two , neck pain in the setting of arthritis disc degeneration .\n[doctor] paragraph , plan . i suspect that this is a flare of cervical radicularopathy . i'm going to set him up for a cervical mri , and we'll tentatively plan for a left c7-t1 epidural afterwards , although the exact location will be pending the mri results . he'll continue his home exercise program as well as twice a day gabapentin . we'll follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief . he denies any blood thinners .",

i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .\n[patient] uh , no , i do n't .\n[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?\n[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .\n[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?\n[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .\n[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .\n[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .\n[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?\n[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .\n[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .\n[patient] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .\n[patient] all right . is the mri today ?\n[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] all right . well , it was nice meeting you , my friend .\n[patient] you as well . thank you .\n[doctor] physical exam , elderly white gentleman presents in a wheelchair . no apparent distress . per the template , down through neuro- neurologic . one plus bilateral biceps . triceps brachioradialis . reflexes bilateral all negative . follow up and take out the lower extremities . gait not assessed today . strength and sensation is per the template . uh , upper and lower extremities . musculoskeletal , he is non-tender over his cervical spine . he does have mildly restricted cervical exte- extension . right and left lateral rotation which is symmetric , which gives him mild lateral neck pain but no radi- radicular pain . spurling's maneuver is benign .\n[doctor] paragraph , diagnostics . cervical x-ray 6421 . cervical x-ray reveals significant disc degeneration at c56 , and to a lower extent c45 and c34 . significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy c67 and c7-t1 is difficult to visualize in the current x-rays .\n[doctor] paragraph , impression . number one , left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radicularopathy . possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy . number two , neck pain in the setting of arthritis disc degeneration .\n[doctor] paragraph , plan . i suspect that this is a flare of cervical radicularopathy . i'm going to set him up for a cervical mri , and we'll tentatively plan for a left c7-t1 epidural afterwards , although the exact location will be pending the mri results . he'll continue his home exercise program as well as twice a day gabapentin . we'll follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief . he denies any blood thinners ."

sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too\n[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand\n[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left\n[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption\n[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends\n[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that\n[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean\n[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed\n[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand\n[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or\n[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it\n[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right\n[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side\n[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that\n[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips\n[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side\n[patient] yeah same thing\n[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time\n[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate\n[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you\n[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start\n[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do\n[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep\n[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some\n[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore\n[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this\n[patient] no i think it's all clear i appreciate it\n[doctor] okay take care and i'll look forward to see you in two weeks\n[patient] very good appreciate your time",

easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain\n[patient] not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them\n[doctor] okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt\n[patient] a little bit yeah\n[doctor] a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far\n[patient] probably not enough i drink some but\n[doctor] okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me\n[patient] no i do n't think so\n[doctor] alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright",

on i would say you know off and on for about two weeks but last week is is when it really became painful i was at a a trade show convention and i could n't walk the halls i could n't do anything i just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time i was there\n[patient] okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it\n[doctor] it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending\n[patient] okay sorry i got a text and\n[doctor] well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all\n[patient] no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner\n[doctor] my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails\n[patient] yeah those those are nice\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] does it does riding your bike bother your big toe\n[doctor] no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side\n[patient] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal\n[doctor] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops\n[patient] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started\n[doctor] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned\n[patient] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother\n[doctor] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot\n[patient] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine\n[doctor] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alrighty\n[patient] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom\n[doctor] yeah ouch\n[patient] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt\n[doctor] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down\n[patient] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt\n[doctor] yeah it a little when you take it a little further\n[patient] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt\n[doctor] that hurts more yeah\n[patient] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt\n[doctor] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too\n[patient] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt\n[doctor] a little bit but not terrible\n[patient] okay what about if i push on the other side here\n[doctor] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yep\n[patient] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back\n[doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in\n[patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint\n[doctor] oh\n[patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage\n[doctor] oh\n[patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach\n[doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach\n[patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes\n[doctor] is that surgery\n[patient] i have to\n[doctor] would that be\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint\n[patient] yeah that would\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer\n[doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done\n[patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this

going on i would say you know off and on for about two weeks but last week is is when it really became painful i was at a a trade show convention and i could n't walk the halls i could n't do anything i just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time i was there\n[patient] okay does it throb ache burn what kind of pain do you get with it\n[doctor] it's almost like a throbbing pain but occasionally it becomes almost like a a sharp stabbing pain especially if i move it or spend too much time walking i i find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending\n[patient] okay sorry i got a text and\n[doctor] well that's okay you know what i i you know i what i really you know i love to ride bikes have you you ride bike at all\n[patient] no i hate riding a bike i'm more of a runner\n[doctor] my gosh i love to ride i ride the lot of rails the trails i mean i go all the last year i put in over eight hundred miles on rails the trails\n[patient] yeah those those are nice\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] does it does riding your bike bother your big toe\n[doctor] no because i i kinda pedal with the the back of my feet you know on that side\n[patient] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal\n[doctor] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops\n[patient] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started\n[doctor] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned\n[patient] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother\n[doctor] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot\n[patient] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine\n[doctor] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alrighty\n[patient] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom\n[doctor] yeah ouch\n[patient] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt\n[doctor] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down\n[patient] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt\n[doctor] yeah it a little when you take it a little further\n[patient] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt\n[doctor] that hurts more yeah\n[patient] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt\n[doctor] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too\n[patient] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt\n[doctor] a little bit but not terrible\n[patient] okay what about if i push on the other side here\n[doctor] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yep\n[patient] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back\n[doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in\n[patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint\n[doctor] oh\n[patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage\n[doctor] oh\n[patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach\n[doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach\n[patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes\n[doctor] is that surgery\n[patient] i have to\n[doctor] would that be\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint\n[patient] yeah that would\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer\n[doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done\n[patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks\n[doctor] okay where i really like catching blue going croppy so okay we'll we'll i'll i'll keep working then i'll find time to do that later\n[patient] very good we will see you in two weeks\n[doctor] okay thank you"

weakness or numbness in your legs right now\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] no\n[doctor] so let me examine you now gloria i'm gon na go ahead and do an exam and let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings just so i can record this and put it into my my into my chart so neck exam you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck little bit of jvd no bruits your lung exam you have some crackles in both bases and some rales that i can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam you have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it does n't feel a regular your belly exam your belly's slightly distended there's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that so that does n't that looks pretty good on your leg exam you do have some one plus pitting edema or actually almost one and a half plus pitting edema in your both of your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign that means no blood clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of your exam is normal so what does this all mean so let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath you know i think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure what i'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams for the next four days i'm gon na have you check your weights everyday and also i'm gon na go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atrovent we had given you some inhalers in the past i can give you another refill if you need to help with that some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath so i'd like to get some of this fluid off you have you check your weights daily we'll have you increase your dose of lasix we'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath i'd like to have you come back in about couple days actually i wan na see how you're doing and if it does n't get better we may have to increase the dose or send you to the hospital okay\n[patient] i do n't want to go to the hospital doctor\n[doctor] yeah so let's try to let's try to use the lasix and let's try to let's try to you know use the breathing treatments and and do that for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point but but right now i'm gon na order some blood tests we'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point okay\n[patient] so i had a piece of cake before i came in here is that gon na affect the the lab work\n[doctor] yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain

any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ?\n[patient] none of that .\n[doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?\n[patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .\n[doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ?\n[patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .\n[doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ?\n[patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .\n[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?\n[patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .\n[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ?\n[patient] i've never had any surgery .\n[doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ?\n[patient] yup .\n[doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ?\n[patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .\n[doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .\n[patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?\n[doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .\n[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .\n[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?\n[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .\n[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?\n[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .\n[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?\n[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .\n[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?\n[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .\n[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?\n[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .\n[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?\n[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .\n[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .\n[patient] what would cause that ?\n[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .\n[patient] that's good .\n[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .\n[patient] what's that ?\n[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .\n[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?\n[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .\n[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?\n[doctor] correct .\n[patient] so what does that mean ?\n[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .\n[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?\n[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .\n[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?\n[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .\n[patient] so what do i need to do ?\n[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .\n[patient] okay . and then what ?\n[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .\n[patient] which medications ?\n[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?\n[patient] about 18 months .\n[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .\n[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?\n[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .\n[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .\n[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .\n[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?\n[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .\n[patient] okay . and then what happens ?\n[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .\n[patient] and when should i see you again ?\n[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .\n[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?\n[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .\n[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .\n[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .\n[patient] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .\n[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .\n[doctor] thank you , mr. allen .",

is everything okay ?\n[doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .\n[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .\n[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?\n[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .\n[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?\n[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .\n[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?\n[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .\n[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?\n[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .\n[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?\n[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .\n[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?\n[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .\n[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .\n[patient] what would cause that ?\n[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .\n[patient] that's good .\n[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .\n[patient] what's that ?\n[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .\n[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?\n[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .\n[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?\n[doctor] correct .\n[patient] so what does that mean ?\n[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .\n[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?\n[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .\n[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?\n[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .\n[patient] so what do i need to do ?\n[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .\n[patient] okay . and then what ?\n[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .\n[patient] which medications ?\n[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?\n[patient] about 18 months .\n[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .\n[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?\n[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .\n[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .\n[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .\n[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?\n[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .\n[patient] okay . and then what happens ?\n[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .\n[patient] and when should i see you again ?\n[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .\n[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?\n[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .\n[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .\n[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .\n[patient] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .\n[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .\n[doctor] thank you , mr. allen ."

medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys\n[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling\n[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high\n[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home\n[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety\n[doctor] wow\n[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again\n[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home\n[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one\n[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all\n[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore\n[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so\n[patient] did they\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] that's good to know\n[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally\n[patient] alright do you want the honest answer\n[doctor] well yeah that would be better\n[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better\n[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches\n[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis\n[doctor] okay what about chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] shortness of breath\n[patient] no shortness of breath\n[doctor] even with exertion\n[patient] even with exertion\n[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed\n[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no\n[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure\n[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease\n[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on\n[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on\n[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve\n[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday\n[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for\n[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends\n[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me\n[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control\n[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] okay take care i'll talk to you later\n[patient] okay alright bye",

think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches\n[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis\n[doctor] okay what about chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] shortness of breath\n[patient] no shortness of breath\n[doctor] even with exertion\n[patient] even with exertion\n[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed\n[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no\n[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure\n[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease\n[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on\n[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on\n[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve\n[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any\n</MAIN_CHUNK>\n\n--- Next Context ---\n[Chunk 1] knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday\n[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for\n[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends\n[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me\n[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control\n[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] okay take care

    "src": "[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , \" fds tendon , \" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .\n[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .\n[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?\n[patient] i'm good , how about you ?\n[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?\n[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .\n[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?\n[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .\n[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?\n[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .\n[doctor] yeah , i see that .\n[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .\n[doctor] what do you do for a living ?\n[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .\n[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?\n[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .\n[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?\n[patient] uh , that's correct .\n[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .\n[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?\n[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .\n[doctor] all right , how about here ?\n[patient] um , there , it's not .\n[doctor] okay , not as bad ?\n[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .\n[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .\n[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .\n[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?\n[patient] ow , .\n[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .\n[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .\n[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .\n[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .\n[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .\n[patient] so the good one is good ?\n[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .\n[patient] okay , all right .\n[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .\n[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .\n[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .\n[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .\n[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .\n[patient] perfect .\n[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .\n[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .\n[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .\n[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...\n[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?\n[patient] uh , not at the moment .\n[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .\n[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?\n[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .\n[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .\n[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .\n[patient] thanks , doc .\n[doctor] right trigger finger injection template . attempted to inject one cc of celestone with f- , a half a cc of lidocaine . however , the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle , with contortions of the hand , and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was

the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , \" fds tendon , \" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .\n[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .\n[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?\n[patient] i'm good , how about you ?\n[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?\n[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .\n[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?\n[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .\n[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?\n[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .\n[doctor] yeah , i see that .\n[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .\n[doctor] what do you do for a living ?\n[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .\n[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?\n[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .\n[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?\n[patient] uh , that's correct .\n[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .\n[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable\n--- End Previous Context ---\n\n<MAIN_CHUNK>\n now here ?\n[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .\n[doctor] all right , how about here ?\n[patient] um , there , it's not .\n[doctor] okay , not as bad ?\n[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .\n[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .\n[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .\n[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?\n[patient] ow , .\n[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .\n[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .\n[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .\n[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .\n[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .\n[patient] so the good one is good ?\n[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .\n[patient] okay , all right .\n[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .\n[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .\n[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .\n[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .\n[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .\n[patient] perfect .\n[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .\n[patient] the lady in

?\n[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .\n[doctor] all right , how about here ?\n[patient] um , there , it's not .\n[doctor] okay , not as bad ?\n[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .\n[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .\n[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .\n[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?\n[patient] ow , .\n[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .\n[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .\n[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .\n[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .\n[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .\n[patient] so the good one is good ?\n[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .\n[patient] okay , all right .\n[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .\n[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .\n[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .\n[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .\n[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .\n[patient] perfect .\n[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .\n[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .\n[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .\n[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...\n[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?\n[patient] uh , not at the moment .\n[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .\n[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?\n[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .\n[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .\n[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .\n[patient] thanks , doc .\n[doctor] right trigger finger injection template . attempted to inject one cc of celestone with f- , a half a cc of lidocaine . however , the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle , with contortions of the hand , and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . a small parma- , uh , palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing in it this evening , and taking ibuprofen ."

okay skiing that sounds exciting alright so what happened what what's when did the injury like what sorry what happened in the injury\n[patient] so i was flying down this black diamond you know like i like to do\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] and this kid who was going faster than me spent by me so then i tried to speed past them and then i ran into a tree and twisted my knee\n[doctor] so we were downhill skiing racing at this point okay is it your left or your right knee\n[patient] it's my right\n[doctor] okay and does it hurt on the inside or the outside\n[patient] the inside\n[doctor] okay so the medial aspect of the right knee when you fell did you hear a pop\n[patient] i did yes\n[doctor] okay alright\n[patient] i think that was my left knee\n[doctor] okay okay alright so we got we got ta pick one if it if it\n[patient] i'm just trying to be real\n[doctor] no\n[patient] what happens in the in a real\n[doctor] a hundred percent so how about this right now you're like i what i'm hearing is that you're experiencing bilateral knee pain like both of your knees hurt but i'm assuming that like your right knee hurts more is that correct\n[patient] yeah my left knee does n't really hurt\n[doctor] uh uh\n[patient] that's the one that popped it the left knee just feels unstable but my right knee hurts\n[doctor] gotcha gotcha okay yeah i think hmmm alright so we're gon na we're gon na go ahead and look at this sort of but on a scale of one to ten how severe is your pain\n[patient] it's a seven\n[doctor] okay that's pretty bad alright and does it has it been increasing or like rapidly or slowly over the last few days\n[patient] it's been slow\n[doctor] okay alright\n[patient] but sometimes it gets to an eleven\n[doctor] okay what would do you know if you are doing something that would cause it to be an eleven are you back on your ski's\n[patient] no i ca n't ski\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] usually when i walk my dog\n[doctor] okay does it hurt more when you walk for longer periods of time\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay how long does the pain last\n[patient] for as long as my walk is and i do n't sometimes i walk five minutes kinda depends on the wind\n[doctor] okay alright\n[patient] sometimes i walk there is\n[doctor] okay alright have you done anything to help with the pain\n[patient] well i wear a brace and i have used a lot of thc cream on it\n[doctor] okay alright thc cream is an interesting choice but do you think that's been helpful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright have you taken\n[patient] reasons\n[doctor] not a problem have you taken any medications\n[patient] no just gummies\n[doctor] okay like vitamins or more thc\n[patient] kind of like thc gummies\n[doctor] thc gummies\n[patient] my grandma gave them to me\n[doctor] thc gummies from grandma that's an excellent grandmother that you have okay have you noticed any swelling stiffness tenderness\n[patient] yeah i i get a lot of swelling and it really is it's very stiff in the morning until i get walking\n[doctor] okay alright and then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past\n[patient] well i had surgery on my right knee before\n[doctor] okay so you've had surgery before alright do you remember what kind of surgery\n[patient] i do n't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing i was fourteen i was a really good gymnast back then really good\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i was doing a back summer salt and i felt a pop then and then since that time i've really had problems with my knee\n[doctor] uh uh\n[patient] but you know the athlete that i am i can still really ski very well so i just kept going\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i'm really tough my pain tolerance is very high\n[doctor] okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events\n[patient] no i think that's about it\n[doctor] okay and how frequently do you normally ski\n[patient] i ski probably three times a week\n[doctor] okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright what\n[patient] nothing no\n[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright so when i move your your kneecap does that hurt\n[patient] no it kinda makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but it does n't hurt my knee\n[doctor] okay so does the pain radiate frequently\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i've never really noticed it just messed with my kneecap\n[doctor] okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar\n[patient] yeah i waddle pretty pretty good now\n[doctor] okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright do you have any questions right now\n[patient] no thank you so much\n[doctor] no problem",

      "src": "[doctor] hi elizabeth so i see that you were experiencing some kind of injury did you say that you hurt your knee\n[patient] yes i hurt my knee when i was skiing two weeks ago\n[doctor] okay skiing that sounds exciting alright so what happened what what's when did the injury like what sorry what happened in the injury\n[patient] so i was flying down this black diamond you know like i like to do\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] and this kid who was going faster than me spent by me so then i tried to speed past them and then i ran into a tree and twisted my knee\n[doctor] so we were downhill skiing racing at this point okay is it your left or your right knee\n[patient] it's my right\n[doctor] okay and does it hurt on the inside or the outside\n[patient] the inside\n[doctor] okay so the medial aspect of the right knee when you fell did you hear a pop\n[patient] i did yes\n[doctor] okay alright\n[patient] i think that was my left knee\n[doctor] okay okay alright so we got we got ta pick one if it if it\n[patient] i'm just trying to be real\n[doctor] no\n[patient] what happens in the in a real\n[doctor] a hundred percent so how about this right now you're like i what i'm hearing is that you're experiencing bilateral knee pain like both of your knees hurt but i'm assuming that like your right knee hurts more is that correct\n[patient] yeah my left knee does n't really hurt\n[doctor] uh uh\n[patient] that's the one that popped it the left knee just feels unstable but my right knee hurts\n[doctor] gotcha gotcha okay yeah i think hmmm alright so we're gon na we're gon na go ahead and look at this sort of but on a scale of one to ten how severe is your pain\n[patient] it's a seven\n[doctor] okay that's pretty bad alright and does it has it been increasing or like rapidly or slowly over the last few days\n[patient] it's been slow\n[doctor] okay alright\n[patient] but sometimes it gets to an eleven\n[doctor] okay what would do you know if you are doing something that would cause it to be an eleven are you back on your ski's\n[patient] no i ca n't ski\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] usually when i walk my dog\n[doctor] okay does it hurt more when you walk for longer periods of time\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay how long does the pain last\n[patient] for as long as my walk is and i do n't sometimes i walk five minutes kinda depends on the wind\n[doctor] okay alright\n[patient] sometimes i walk there is\n[doctor] okay alright have you done anything to help with the pain\n[patient] well i wear a brace and i have used a lot of thc cream on it\n[doctor] okay alright thc cream is an interesting choice but do you think that's been helpful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright have you taken\n[patient] reasons\n[doctor] not a problem have you taken any medications\n[patient] no just gummies\n[doctor] okay like vitamins or more thc\n[patient] kind of like thc gummies\n[doctor] thc gummies\n[patient] my grandma gave them to me\n[doctor] thc gummies from grandma that's an excellent grandmother that you have okay have you noticed any swelling stiffness tenderness\n[patient] yeah i i get a lot of swelling and it really is it's very stiff in the morning until i get walking\n[doctor] okay alright and then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past\n[patient] well i had surgery on my right knee before\n[doctor] okay so you've had surgery before alright do you remember what kind of surgery\n[patient] i do n't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing i was fourteen i was a really good gymnast back then really good\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i was doing a back summer salt and i felt a pop then and then since that time i've really had problems with my knee\n[doctor] uh uh\n[patient] but you know the athlete that i am i can still really ski very well so i just kept going\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i'm really tough my pain tolerance is very high\n[doctor] okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events\n[patient] no i think that's about it\n[doctor] okay and how frequently do you normally ski\n[patient] i ski probably three times a week\n[doctor] okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright what\n[patient] nothing no\n[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright so when i move your your kneecap does that hurt\n[patient] no it kinda makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but it does n't hurt my knee\n[doctor] okay so does the pain radiate frequently\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i've never really noticed it just messed with my kneecap\n[doctor] okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar\n[patient] yeah i waddle pretty pretty good now\n[doctor] okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright do you have any questions right now\n[patient] no thank you so much\n[doctor] no problem"

how are you doing with ... i know you were making some diet changes .\n[patient] yeah , i've been pretty good with the diet , but with the pain i have been having, it has been easier to call and have something delivered. so i have been ordering a lot of take-out and fast food that can be delivered to my door so i don't have to go out and up and down the steps to get it myself. but other than that , it's been pretty good .\n[doctor] okay . are you staying hydrated ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . all right . okay , well , let's go ahead and , uh , i know the nurse did a review of systems , you know , with you , and i know that you're endorsing some back pain and a little bit of dizziness , um , and some blood in your urine . any other symptoms ?

i i think the sugar has been okay\n[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that\n[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff\n[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under

results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all\n[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though\n[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while\n[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related\n[doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today\n[patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think\n[doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so\n[patient] these are like my video visit exams\n[doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything\n[patient] no i i think i'm okay

you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything\n[patient] no i i think i'm okay you gave me a year's worth of refills last time we were together\n[doctor] okay sounds great alright thanks gabriel good seeing you again\n[patient] good to see you thanks"

monday as a quit date and on that day i'm gon na start you with a twenty one milligram nicotine patch and the goal will be to decrease that over time okay now we will work together to decrease that so there is no necessarily hard dates in mind okay be sure to change the patch location each day and that's going to help reduce or avoid that skin irritation that can occur if you use the same location over and over again i would like to see you again in two weeks just to see how things are going and we will reevaluate at that time the dosage for your nicotine patch now we also see further need to discuss any handouts you received today for those common smoking triggers i really want you to keep an eye on and monitor your stress level not only about work but also the fact that you are experiencing are going to be be a new father and we really want to watch any stress you will be experiencing around the birth of your new child so please keep an eye on that and let me know how that goes now for now until we meet in two weeks go ahead and keep up your exercise routine i think that's a great plan and just try to monitor your stress and and maybe think about some things like meditation or adding in some yoga and that type of thing to help further work with your your stress levels so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] no not at this time\n[doctor] okay so for your other conditions that we talked about briefly your second condition of type two diabetes we'll let's go ahead and continue to maintain that with diet and exercise and we'll just monitor your type two diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c for your next blood draw since i'll see you in two weeks go ahead and have that done and we will talk about that when you come back in now for your third problem of your history of gout let's go ahead and continue you on your allopurinol and just you know continue to watch those foods that will exacerbate your uric acid levels any other questions about those\n[patient] no i think that's it thanks so much\n[doctor] alright sounds good i'll see you in two weeks congratulations on the baby and and we're excited about next monday that's

you fall\n[patient] yeah so i was taking out the trash last night and i ended up slipping on a patch of ice like and then when i fell i heard this pop and it just hurts\n[doctor] okay so have you been able to walk on it at all or is it you know\n[patient] at first no like my friend who was visiting thankfully had to help me get into the house and i you know and now i'm able to put like a little bit of weight on it but i'm i i'm still limping\n[doctor] okay well you know that's not good we'll we'll hopefully we can get you fixed up here so how much how much pain have you been in on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt\n[patient] it's it's more like so when i first fell it was pretty bad but now it's it's at like a six you know like it's uncomfortable\n[doctor] okay and how would you describe that pain is it a constant pain or is it only when you move the ankle\n[patient] it's it's constant it's like a throbbing pain you know and like when i touch it it feels kinda warm\n[doctor] okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it\n[patient] well like last night i iced it and i kept it elevated you know i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning\n[doctor] alright has the ibuprofen helped at all\n[patient] not really\n[doctor] okay alright so i just want to know i know some of my patients they have like bad ankles where they hurt the ankles all the time but have you ever injured this ankle before\n[patient] so you know in high school i used to play a lot of soccer but and and like i had other injuries but i've never injured like this particular ankle before but because i used to play like all the time i knew what i was supposed to do but this is i also knew that it was it was time to come in\n[doctor] okay yeah yeah definitely if you if you ca n't walk on it we definitely good thing that you came in today and we were able to see you so have you experienced any numbness in your foot at all\n[patient] no no numbness and i do n't think i've had like any tingling or anything like that\n[doctor] okay that that's good yeah it sounds like you have sensation there so yeah that that's really good so let me do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals your blood pressure was one twenty over eighty which is good your heart rate your spo2 was ninety eight percent which is good that means you're you're getting all of your oxygen and so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick so when i press here does that hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright what about here\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is ecchymosis so you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral\n[patient] malleolus\n[doctor] malleolus associated with swelling there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue there is no laxity on the anterior drawer and inversion stress there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot there your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so we did get an x-ray of your ankle before you came in and luckily it's there is no fractures no bony abnormalities which is really good so let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for your right ankle pain your symptoms your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain have you sprained your ankle before most times people do the athletics play soccer it happens every so often but have you done that before\n[patient] no i do n't think so\n[doctor] okay well you're one of the lucky ones some of my my patients that play sports they sprain their ankle seems like every other week so good for you so for that that that ankle sprain i just want to keep i want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated and i want you to continue to ice it you can ice it let's say five times a day for twenty minutes at a time just to help that swelling go down i'm gon na give you an air cast to help you stabilize the ankle so keep it from moving and then i'll give you crutches and so i want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days and then you can start walking on it as tolerated tolerated so how does that sound\n[patient] it's alright\n[doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] yeah like how long do you think it's gon na take for me to heal\n[doctor] i mean it should take a a couple of days i mean i think in a day or two you will be able to walk on it but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks you know your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst but it's kinda you know medium grade ankle sprain so as i would say about two to three weeks you should be back to normal you will see some of that bruising go away\n[patient] yeah okay can i get a doctor's note\n[doctor] no because you need to go back to work because you work on the computer not running so\n[patient] fine\n[doctor] yeah you ca n't get a doctor's note so if you if i write a note i'm gon na tell your boss that you have to go to work\n[patient] okay thanks\n[doctor] so i i would n't do that but yeah but otherwise if if if you continue to have pain after this week if you feel like it's not getting better please feel free to contact the office and we can get you back in and possibly do an mri if we you know need to\n[patient]

weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt\n[patient] no uh uh\n[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions\n[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery\n[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with\n[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc\n[doctor] i know\n[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too\n[doctor] so it's actually\n[patient] have to be in the hospital\n[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed\n[patient] i'm right handed\n[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what\n[patient] i mean\n[doctor] uh uh\n[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but\n[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there\n[patient] i suppose so\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be

pain for the last three weeks so\n[doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better\n[patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started\n[doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit\n[patient] hmmm\n[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of\n[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that\n[doctor] no nothing at all\n[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that\n[doctor] no\n[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before\n[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help\n[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck\n[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain\n[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder\n[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere\n[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go\n[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well\n[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it\n[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all\n[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers\n[doctor] no numbness or tingling\n[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] acromioclavicular joints\n[doctor] yeah yeah\n[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch\n[doctor] yes thank you yep\n[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are\n[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder\n[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before\n[doctor] i have n't\n[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan\n[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away\n[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days\n[doctor] okay alright thank you\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] okay bye",

      "src": "[doctor] alright you can go ahead\n[patient] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so\n[doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better\n[patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started\n[doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit\n[patient] hmmm\n[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of\n[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that\n[doctor] no nothing at all\n[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that\n[doctor] no\n[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before\n[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help\n[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck\n[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain\n[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder\n[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere\n[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go\n[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well\n[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it\n[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all\n[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers\n[doctor] no numbness or tingling\n[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] acromioclavicular joints\n[doctor] yeah yeah\n[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch\n[doctor] yes thank you yep\n[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are\n[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder\n[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before\n[doctor] i have n't\n[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan\n[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away\n[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days\n[doctor] okay alright thank you\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] okay bye"

sports when you were younger\n[patient] no anything you can think of primarily it was basketball baseball and football\n[doctor] okay and did your elbows hurt at that time or is this a a new injury\n[patient] it's new\n[doctor] when did it start\n[patient] probably year and a half ago\n[doctor] okay on both elbows about a year and a half ago\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay have you taken

hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] how about this\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so pain with both flexion and extension\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright how about the outside\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers\n[patient] i think so\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay great\n[patient] good to go\n[doctor] sensation is normal to the touch\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt\n[patient] not as much\n[doctor] how about this way\n[patient] not as much\n[doctor] alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no pain with pronation on the right side\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] same thing on the left\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation\n[patient] correct\n[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is\n[patient] is that golfer's elbow\n[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot\n[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time\n[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow\n[patient] well i have n't been pitching either\n[doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice\n[patient] thank god\n[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before\n[patient] no please tell me remind me\n[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow\n[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow\n[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow\n[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then\n[doctor] no\n[patient] not at all\n[doctor] what is it\n[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] that it activates the healing\n[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is\n[patient] interesting cool\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] maybe i have heard about that\n[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this\n[patient] i'm excited\n[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not

okay\n[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain\n[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go\n[patient] it's constant\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable\n[doctor] alright are you able to urinate\n[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood\n[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes\n[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time\n[doctor] third time alright\n[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever\n[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous\n[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain\n[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working\n[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved\n[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah\n[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so we are getting close there\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff\n[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff\n[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running\n[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the\n[doctor] the one eighties which was really high\n[patient] right\n[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that\n[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] like\n[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help\n[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright\n[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday\n[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds\n[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i do take it\n[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain\n[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain\n[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound\n[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you\n[doctor] okay no problem",

hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound\n[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you\n[doctor] okay no problem"

do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else\n[patient] yes no just in the back of my head\n[doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what\n[patient] i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring\n[doctor] okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache\n[patient] no no fever\n[doctor] okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you had headaches like this before\n[patient] i have\n[doctor] okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say\n[patient] no it's not\n[doctor] okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what\n[patient] i have n't been checking my blood sugars\n[doctor] really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise\n[patient] i have not been eating well because i've been stressed over the last week but i have n't been exercising for maybe the past week but generally i've been doing better\n[doctor] okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what\n[patient] yes it has\n[doctor] okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being\n[patient] not lately\n[doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it\n[patient] i did\n[doctor] yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or\n[patient] i am\n[doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful\n[patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to\n[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me\n[patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better\n[doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you\n[patient] no no i think it's just stress\n[doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] sure",

you're having headaches well let's talk about it but i would like to record this conversation with this app that's gon na help me focus on you more would that be okay with you\n[patient] yes that's okay\n[doctor] okay great thanks so carolyn tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having\n[patient] my headache started about a week ago it's feeling like a dull pain in the back of my head i have flushing in my ears they get really red and hot and sometimes i just feel a little bit dizzy when i get these headaches but i've taken tylenol and advil and it's not really going away it just keeps coming back\n[doctor] okay and alright and so this started about a week ago has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what\n[patient] it comes and goes i it it's relieved when i take my tylenol or advil but then it comes right back\n[doctor] hmmm okay and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse\n[patient] it's definitely worse in the evening\n[doctor] okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else\n[patient] yes no just in the back of my head\n[doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what\n[patient] i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring\n[doctor] okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache\n[patient] no no fever\n[doctor] okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you had headaches like this before\n[patient] i have\n[doctor] okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say\n[patient] no it's not\n[doctor] okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what\n[patient] i have n't been checking my blood sugars\n[doctor] really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise\n[patient] i have not been eating well because i've been stressed over the last week but i have n't been exercising for maybe the past week but generally i've been doing better\n[doctor] okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what\n[patient] yes it has\n[doctor] okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being\n[patient] not lately\n[doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it\n[patient] i did\n[doctor] yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or\n[patient] i am\n[doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful\n[patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to\n[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me\n[patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better\n[doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you\n[patient] no no i think it's just stress\n[doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] sure"

happened\n[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts\n[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't\n[patient] i did fall to the ground\n[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on\n[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on\n[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question\n[patient] not really\n[doctor] no\n[patient] he does n't have much game\n[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts\n[patient] on the inside\n[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything\n[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap\n[doctor] you had ice and what\n[patient] an ace wrap\n[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly\n[patient] seven\n[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct\n[patient] correct\n[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home\n[patient] every morning\n[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this\n[patient] i did not no\n[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today\n[patient] some exercises ice and mobic\n[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal\n[patient] yes it hurts\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me\n[patient] when can i play basketball again\n[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball\n[patient] i just played the wife with fun\n[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment\n[patient] yeah they do\n[doctor] okay i you know i'm i'm just thinking you know i need to get some new shoes for some of it my activities i love the i wish i could play basketball but i do a lot of bike riding so i'm always looking for anything that's gon na help me on the bike do you does your family have supplies like that\n[patient] we do let me know and i can get you the hook up\n[doctor] okay great great so i'll i i will let you know i'll just get on and take a look first but i'm gon na go ahead and get get you discharged i'll have my assistant come in we will get you discharged and like i said we will make an appointment for seven days and we will go from there any questions\n[patient] i think you've answered them all thank you\n[doctor] okay great",

no\n[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this\n[patient] i did not no\n[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today\n[patient] some exercises ice and mobic\n[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal\n[patient] yes it hurts\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me\n[patient] when can i play basketball again\n[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball\n[patient] i just played the wife with fun\n[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment\n[patient] yeah they do\n[doctor] okay i you know i'm i'm just thinking you know i need to get some new shoes for some of it my activities i love the i wish i could play basketball but i do a lot of bike riding so i'm always looking for anything that's gon na help me on the bike do you does your family have supplies like that\n[patient] we do let me know and i can get you the hook up\n[doctor] okay great great so i'll i i will let you know i'll just get on and take a look first but i'm gon na go ahead and get get you discharged i'll have my assistant come in we will get you discharged and like i said we will make an appointment for seven days and we will go from there any questions\n[patient] i think you've answered them all thank you\n[doctor] okay great"

ca n't really think of any specific event\n[doctor] okay now it it says here that it's in both knees is that correct\n[patient] yes both my knees\n[doctor] okay it kinda try let's let's try describing

activities makes the pain feel worse\n[patient] let's see so anytime so if i'm sitting at my desk and i get up i have a lot of pain so anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs\n[doctor] okay so you work from home\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it\n[patient] no well first thing in the morning but otherwise it's downstairs\n[doctor] okay okay how do you like working from home\n[patient] you know it has it's plus and minuses\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i like it though my i like my commute\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i love it\n[doctor] and the parking i'm sure the parking is\n[patient] and the parking is great\n[doctor] yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better\n[patient] usually after like if i feel that pain and then i just it does get better\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all\n[patient] yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it takes the edge off\n[doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying\n[patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain\n[doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office\n[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile\n[doctor] yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up\n[patient] exactly\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it's\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before\n[patient] you know despite how active i am i you know i've never\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] injured or broken a bone\n[doctor] okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me\n[patient] so will i be able to run again\n[doctor] absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else\n[patient] no i think that's it\n[doctor] okay have a great day\n[patient] okay you too\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] bye",

doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen\n[doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right\n[patient] it's my right one of course\n[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain\n[patient] gosh it's like a nine\n[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it\n[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] really\n[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen\n[patient] this happened yesterday morning\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just not it's really bad\n[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry\n[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally\n[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just really along my wrist\n[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling\n[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling\n[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well\n[patient] yeah it does\n[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like\n[patient] not without extreme pain\n[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up\n[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually\n[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright and then lateral as well\n[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason\n[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist\n[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight\n[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you\n[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all\n[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down\n[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better\n[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] pardon what\n[patient] a what\n[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay\n[patient] when do i have to have the surgery\n[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so what\n[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace\n[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks\n[patient] six weeks\n[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of\n[patient] oof\n[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions\n[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so\n[doctor] okay how long is the vacation\n[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks\n[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks\n[patient] no vacation in a month\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] no problem bye\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present",

like chronic i wanted to ask you\n[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all\n[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down\n[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better\n[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] pardon what\n[patient] a what\n[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay\n[patient] when do i have to have the surgery\n[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so what\n[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace\n[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks\n[patient] six weeks\n[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of\n[patient] oof\n[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions\n[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so\n[doctor] okay how long is the vacation\n[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks\n[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks\n[patient] no vacation in a month\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] no problem bye\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present"

out or something\n[patient] no it's do n't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves but it's mostly sideways motion\n[doctor] and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance\n[patient] not gon na take the chance\n[doctor] okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough\n[patient] wrap it i would n't be able to keep track of it so no no pain\n[doctor] okay okay well so since you're in how about your blood pressure how how is it doing and have you been taking your blood pressures at home like we talked about\n[patient] yes they are doing fine still about the same\n[doctor] so\n[patient] correct that whatever\n[doctor] so what has it been running\n[patient] i ca n't really remember it's been several days since i took it but i think it runs around one twenty over seventy somewhere along in

eight thirty at night\n[doctor] and what is the medication and the dosage that you are taking\n[patient] i'm taking a farxiga and amlodipine\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and lisinopril and the hydrochlorothiazide so i i ca n't pronounce that one so but those are all small dosage pills\n[doctor] that but yeah go ahead\n[patient] no that was it i just take them regularly eight thirty in the morning eight thirty at night\n[doctor] yeah well that's good i i know you said you set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you get them taken at the right time so that's really good and how are your blood sugars doing how is your diet doing\n[patient] my blood sugar has been running a little higher at about one thirty\n[doctor] is that in the morning when you're fasting\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i have been told that sometimes the morning blood sugars are higher for some reason but i do n't know i i do n't really worry about it as long as it does n't get up too extremely high so\n[doctor] and are you taking your metformin\n[patient] yes yes that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night\n[doctor] okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that\n[patient] no we usually eat by six\n[doctor] okay okay alright well hopefully we can get you to feeling better okay so i want to do a quick physical exam really check that knee out so your vital signs look good they they look alright your temperature is ninety eight . two your pulse is seventy two respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one twenty two over seventy so that looks fine i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs so on your heart exam it's a nice regular rate and rhythm but i appreciate a slight two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left base here on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally okay now let's take a quick look at that knee so does it hurt when i press on it\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay can you bend your knee and straighten it out\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na do some maneuvers and i'm gon na just gon na call out my findings on this okay on your right knee exam no ecchymosis or edema no effusion no pain to palpation of the of the left medial knee is there any decreased range of motion do you feel you feel like you're you're able to fully move that as you should the same as the other knee\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay so no decreased range of motion negative varus and valgus test okay and so with your x-rays i reviewed the result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and\n[patient]

take a look at that so can you tell me what happened to your knee\n[patient] yeah i was you know i was just doing some work on my property and i i accidentally slipped and fell down and i just still having some knee issues\n[doctor] okay well that that's not good do you\n[patient] no\n[doctor] what part of your knee would you say hurts\n[patient] i would just say you know the it it you know it basically when i when i'm flexing my knee when i'm moving it up and down and i put pressure on it\n[doctor] alright did you hear a pop or anything like that\n[patient] i did feel something pop yes\n[doctor] okay and did it was it swollen afterwards or is it looks a little bit swollen right now\n[patient] yeah little bit swollen yeah\n[doctor] okay so so far have you taken anything for the pain\n[patient] just taking some ibuprofen just for some swelling\n[doctor] okay that's it what would you say your pain score is a out of ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt\n[patient] i would say that when i'm stationary i do n't really feel a lot of pain but if i start doing some mobility i would say probably a four five\n[doctor] about a four okay and how long ago did you say this was is this happened this injury\n[patient] it's been a week now\n[doctor] a week okay alright alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly\n[patient] yes i have\n[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that\n[patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes\n[doctor] okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today\n[patient] no\n[doctor] are you any belly pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no shortness of breath just wan na make sure\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any wheezes or crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do still hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and you already had that and so we we knew about that already so lem me look at your knee here so when i press here on the inside of your knee does that hurt\n[patient] a little bit\n[doctor] little bit how about when i press on the outs the outside gon na press on the outside is that painful\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no alright so i'm gon na have you flex your knee is that painful\n[patient] yeah that's uncomfortable\n[doctor] that's uncomfortable and extend it so that's painful\n[patient] yeah yes\n[doctor] okay so on your knee exam i i see that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of your right knee you have some pain with flexion extension i also identify some edema around the knee and some effusion you have a little bit of fluid in there as well so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you did n't break anything so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have what we call a mcl strain so a medial collateral ligament strain so when you fell i think you twisted a little bit and so it irritated you strained that that ligament there so for that what we can do for you first i'm gon na prescribe you some ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams and you can take that twice a day and that's gon na help you with that swelling and that pain that you currently do have i'm also gon na put you in a a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal and then i want you to ice the knee you can do that for twenty minutes at a time for three to four times a day that should also help with the the swelling of your knee for your hypertension now i'm gon na keep you on that twenty of lisinopril okay because you are taking it and you you're doing pretty good with it i also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that diet you know because right now you are your diet is little bit out of control so we just need to rain you in a little bit and hopefully you know with their help we can eventually get you off that lisinopril alright so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] do i need to elevate my leg or stay off my leg or\n[doctor] yeah i would yeah you can elevate your leg stay off your stay off your leg you know if you have any kids have them work out in the yard instead of you just to to for a couple of weeks it's a good thing if you want to do that\n[patient] tell him this doctor's order\n[doctor] tell definitely tell him his doctor tell him i said it\n[patient] alright do you have any other questions no that's it i appreciate you seeing me\n[doctor] alright so my nurse will be in with the those orders and we will see you next time",

you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened\n[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot\n[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before\n[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot\n[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing\n[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field\n[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then\n[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well\n[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three\n[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] like a seven eight\n[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer\n[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time\n[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else\n[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school\n[doctor] that's\n[patient] high school teams\n[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome",

you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three\n[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] like a seven eight\n[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer\n[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time\n[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else\n[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school\n[doctor] that's\n[patient] high school teams\n[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome"

i know that , you know , we have some issues to talk-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . about today . were you able to take any vacations over the summer ?\n[patient] um ... some long weekends , which was great . just kind of- trying to mix it up through the summer . so lots of three day weekends .\n[doctor] okay , well i'm glad to hear that .\n[doctor] um ... so let's talk a little bit about your diabetes . how are you doing with that ? i know that- you know , i remember you have a sweet tooth . so ...\n[patient] yeah ... i-i love peanut butter cups . um ... and i have to say that when we were helping my daughter , we were on the fly and on the go and haven't had a home cooked meal in weeks, our diets were less than stellar .\n[patient] and uh ... i-i think i need to go clean for a couple of weeks . but other than that , it was been- it's been pretty good eating .\n[doctor] okay , all right . and how about your high blood pressure ? are you monitoring your blood pressure readings at home , like i recommended ?\n[patient] i'm good about it during the week while i am at home working, but on the weekends when i'm out of the house i tend to forget . uh , and so it's not as regimented , but it's been pretty good and-and under control for the most part .\n[doctor] okay , and you're you're taking your medication ?\n[patient] yes , i am .\n[doctor] okay . and then lastly , i know that you had had some early arthritis in your knee . how- how are you doing with that ?\n[patient] uh ... it gets aggravated every once in a while . if i- maybe if i run too much or if i've lift boxes that are a little too heavy , i start to feel the strain . but it's been okay . not great , but it's been okay .\n[doctor] okay . all right , well ... let me go ahead and- you know , i know that the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you when you- when you checked in . i know that you were endorsing the back pain .\n[doctor] have you had any other symptoms , chest pain , nausea or vomiting-\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] . fever , chills ?\n[patient] no . no none whatsoever .\n[doctor] no . okay . all right , well let me go ahead , i want to do a quick physical exam .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure .\n[doctor] so it's a little elevated . your blood pressure's a little elevated here in the office , but you know you could be in some pain , which could make your-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . blood pressure go up . let's look at the readings .\n[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings .\n[doctor] yeah ... yeah you know they do run a little bit on the high side , so we'll have to address that as well .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay , well . let me- i'm just going to be listening your heart and your lungs and i'll check out your back and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] and kick against my hands .\n[doctor] okay , good . all right .\n[doctor] okay , so ... on physical examination , you know , i-i do hear a slight 2 out of 6 s- s- systolic heart murmur .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] on your heart exam . which you've had in the past .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] so that sounds stable to me .\n[doctor] on your back exam , you know , you do have some pain to palpation of the lumbar spine . and you have pain with flexion and extension of the back . and you have a negative straight leg raise , which is which is good . so , let's- let's just look at some of your results , okay ?\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the diabetes labs .\n[doctor] okay , so ... in reviewing the results of your diabetes labs , your hemoglobin a1c is a little elevated at eight . i'd like to see it a little bit better , okay ?\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the back x-ray .\n[doctor] so in reviewing the results of your back x-ray , this looks like a normal x-ray . there's good bony alignment , there's normal uh- there's no fracture present . uh , so this is a normal x-ray of your back , which is not surprising based on-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . the history , okay ?\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] so let's just go ahead and we'll- we're going to go over , you know , my assessment and my plan for you .\n[doctor] so for your first problem , your back pain . you know , i think you have a lumbar strain from the lifting . so , let's go ahead . we can prescribe you some meloxicam 15 mg once a day .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i want you to continue to ice it , okay . i want you to try to avoid any strenuous activity and we can go ahead and- and refer you to physical therapy-\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] . and see how you do , okay ?\n[patient] you got it .\n[doctor] for your next problem , your diabetes . y-you know , i think it's a little under- out of control . so i want to increase the metformin to 1000 mg twice a day . and i'm going to um ... um ... i'm going to repeat a hemoglobin a1c in about 6 months , okay ?\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] hey dragon ? order a hemoglobin a1c .\n[doctor] so , for your third problem , your hypertension . uh ... i-i'd like to go ahead increase the lisinopril from 10 mg to 20 mg a day .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] does that sound okay ? i think we need to get it under better control .\n[patient] no that's fine . i agree .\n[doctor] hey dragon ? order lisinopril 20 mg daily .\n[doctor] and for your last problem , your osteoarthritis , i-i think that you were doing a really good job , in terms of you know what , monitoring your knee and uh ...\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i do n't think we need to do any- any further , you know , work up of that at this time , okay ?\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] do you have any questions logan ?\n[patient] not at this point .\n[doctor] okay . all right .\n[doctor] so the nurse will come in to help you get checked out , okay ?\n[patient] you got it .\n[doctor] hey dragon ?

sometimes and i've had surgery for that too and you know one of those things where you know it might give out once in a while but i'm not sure that's related to what the you know break dropping on my foot but you know either way my foot's a little sore\n[doctor] okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you

why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it\n[doctor] so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult\n[patient] lucken it up\n[doctor] okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain\n[patient] no i feel like taking the medicine\n[doctor] okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet\n[patient] no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a

bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and

where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that\n[patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast\n[doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible\n[patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri\n[doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm

before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that\n[patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast\n[doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible\n[patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri\n[doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon\n[patient] can i think about it and we have some time\n[doctor] sure\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright thanks elijah"

it's kind of embarrassing but yeah it's been killing me for a couple days now\n[doctor] okay now when you fell did you feel or hear a pop or anything like that\n[patient] i would n't say i really heard a pop it was just kind of really kind of felt extended and stretched and it it's just been really bothering me ever since kind of on the outside of it\n[doctor] okay and then were you able to walk on it after the incident\n[patient] i was able to get back to the house because i did n't wan na you know make my wife carry me but it was it was painful\n[doctor] okay and then have you done any or had any injuries to that ankle before\n[patient] nothing substantial that i would say in the past\n[doctor] okay and then what have you been doing for that left ankle since then have you done anything to help make it make the pain less\n[patient] i have taken some ibuprofen and then i just tried to elevate it and ice it a little bit and keep my weight off of it\n[doctor] okay so let's talk real quick about your pain level zero being none ten being the worst pain you've been in in your life without any medication on board can you rate your pain for me\n[patient] i would say it's about an eight\n[doctor] okay and then when you do take that ibuprofen or tylenol what what's your relief level what's your pain look like then\n[patient] maybe a seven it it's a little\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned going for a walk my wife and i've been on on back behind the new rex center where the new trails are have you guys been back there\n[patient] we have n't yet but i'm sure we'll check it out ever since i feel like working at home during covid we we we take walks all the time\n[doctor] yeah i\n[patient] no i have n't been there yet\n[doctor] yeah those those trails are great there's like

get you back out there okay\n[patient] awesome\n[doctor] so let's let's talk a little bit about my physical exam if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you your vitals look stable by the way a little elevated i know you're in pain on a focused exam of your left ankle now i do appreciate that there is ecchymosis or bruising over the lateral malleolus and there is some swelling i do i do appreciate some edema now you are positive for tenderness to palpation on the lateral side and the the soft tissue is swollen here the good news is i do not appreciate any laxity in the joint okay and i do n't feel any any type of bony tenderness to palpation of your foot now on the neurovascular exam of your left foot capillary refill is brisk less than three seconds and i do appreciate strong dorsalis pedis pulses and you do have motor and sensation intact which is good now it's important that they were compared bilaterally and they are yeah your your exam is the same bilaterally so that that's an important thing now we did do an x-ray of that left ankle when you came in so i'm gon na review those x-ray results with you now the good news is i do not appreciate a fracture or any bony abnormalities so that's a good thing right so let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of your left ankle pain your symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex and the ligament on the outside of your ankle is what got stretched when you fell now the best treatment for this sprain is what you've kind of already been doing doing the elevation and compression and ice so we're gon na continue the rice protocol and i am gon na go ahead and give you an air cast just to stabilize that ankle i'm gon na prescribe you some crutches i want you to stay off that leg but i do want you to start walking as tolerated but it may be a few days before you feel like doing that now your symptoms are going to get better significantly over the first you know four five six seven days but i am gon na wan na follow up with you just to make sure you're doing okay so what i do is i would like to see you in two

up\n[patient] no i think that sounds like a plan\n[doctor] okay sounds good like i said i will see you in two weeks if you have any questions or if you have a lot of pain come back in we'll reevaluate

throat but i think my tonsils are swollen too\n[doctor] and your tonsils are swollen too now has anyone else sick in your household\n[patient] i do have little kids that go to school so they've always got you know those little runny noses or cough but nobody is really complaining of anything\n[doctor] okay alright now have you had strep throat in the past\n[patient] when i was a kid i had strep throat but i have n't had anything like that as an adult\n[doctor] okay alright and what do you do for work\n[patient] i i work as a cashier in a supermarket\n[doctor] okay alright and did you get your covid vaccine\n[patient] yep i did get my covid vaccine but it really made me feel sick so i'm hoping i do n't have to get another one later this year\n[doctor] okay did so you just got the two vaccines you did n't get the booster\n[patient] no i did n't get the booster because i really have n't had time to feel that sick again it really knocked me down for like two days and with the little kids it's really hard\n[doctor] okay alright well i saw that they did a rapid covid test when you came in here and that was negative so that's good so you do n't have covid which is which is good now let's talk a little bit about your hypertension and hypertension since i have you here did you ever buy that blood pressure cuff that i asked you to buy\n[patient] yes i did i blood the blood pressure cuff and my blood pressure is like all over the place sometimes it could be like one twenty for the top number sometimes it could be one forty for the top number i i do n't really remember the bottom number though\n[doctor] okay that's okay are you taking the lisinopril i think we have you on twenty milligrams a day\n[patient] yep i take it every morning with my multivitamin and my vitamin d\n[doctor] okay alright and are you watching your salt intake\n[patient] i really like my chips with my wine\n[doctor] is n't that the best we we could get along really well outside of here alright and then tell me a little bit about your diabetes now are you are you watching your blood sugars are you taking them at home\n[patient] sometimes i take that all that often again that could be all over the place sometimes i get if i take it first thing in the morning it'll be like eighty or ninety but at night sometimes it could be one forty\n[doctor] okay alright and i are you still taking the metformin we have you on a thousand milligrams twice a day\n[patient] uh uh yes i do take it i take it with my breakfast and with my dinner\n[doctor] okay alright great alright now are you are you a meds fan or a yankie's fan or god for a bit of filly's fan\n[patient] nope\n[doctor] no\n[patient] no do n't do n't like sports\n[doctor] do n't like sports just the wine\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam now i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking here first at your vital signs your vital signs look pretty good you do have a low-grade fever of about a hundred . four right now but otherwise your blood pressure is pretty good it's about one thirty two over eighty and your heart rate is eighty four now that looks pretty good so i'm just gon na go ahead and examine you so on your facial exam i'm gon na just press on your face here does this hurt\n[patient] no not no it does n't bother me\n[doctor] okay on facial examination the patient has no pain to palpation of the frontal or maxillary sinuses on nasal examination there is edema and erythema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated clear discharge open up your mouth and say\n[patient] ah\n[doctor] on throat examination there is bilateral erythema and edema of the peritonsillar space with exudates present bilaterally the uvula is midline on your neck exam i do appreciate some cervical lymphadenopathy on the right hand side on your lung exam your lungs you have some coarse rhonchi at the bases that clear with cough and on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur or or rub so what does all of that mean teresa so all of that means is that yes you're showing signs of what we call an upper respiratory infection and i'm concerned that you might have some strep in the back of your throat based on the findings so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay so for your first problem of your sore throat i'm gon na go ahead and have the medical assistant come in and swab you for a rapid strep test and if that's positive i wan na go ahead and place you on or prescribe amoxicillin five hundred milligrams three times a day for ten days and i'm gon na give you some lidocaine swish and swallow so that will help with some of the pain and you can take some ibuprofen as needed which will also help with the pain and some of that fever okay i do want you to go ahead and continue to to hydrate as much as possible what kind of questions do you have about that\n[patient] no that sounds good i just wanted to be sure i was okay because of the little kids\n[doctor] sure now for your next problem of your hypertension i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel on you and i think i do wan na increase i do wan na increase the lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day just to get your blood pressure under better control and we'll see how you do on the forty milligrams once a day for your third problem of your diabetes let's go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and just to make sure that we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin how does that sound\n[patient] sounds good\n[doctor] any questions\n[patient] nope that's everything\n[doctor] okay bye good to see you
